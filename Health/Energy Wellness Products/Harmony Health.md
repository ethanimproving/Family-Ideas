The article claims that the Harmony Health 34oz ENERGIZER Quanta Mug can energize liquids and revitalize food.

The term "energized" has a specific meaning in science that refers to the transfer of energy to a system. In the context of food and drinks, this would usually mean increasing the temperature or adding calories. There is nothing in the design of the mug that suggests it could do either of these things.

Similarly, there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that food can be "revitalized". Food spoilage is caused by the growth of bacteria and other microorganisms. Once food has spoiled, there is no way to bring it back to its original state.

1. **Quantum Physics**: Products like these often use terms like "quantum" to sound scientific and credible. However, they frequently misuse or misunderstand concepts from quantum physics. Quantum physics deals with the behavior of particles at the smallest scales and doesn't have direct applications to health or wellness products in the way they're often marketed.
    
2. **Vague Claims**: Claims of "energizing" foods and liquids are often very vague and lack scientific specificity. Without clear explanations of how the product works and what exactly it does to the food or liquid, it's challenging to evaluate its effectiveness.
    
3. **Pseudoscience**: Many products that claim to "energize" or "harmonize" items rely on pseudoscientific concepts or unproven theories. These claims often lack rigorous scientific evidence and rely on anecdotes or testimonials rather than controlled studies.
    
4. **Lack of Regulation**: In many countries, including the United States, regulations for health and wellness products are not as strict as those for medications. This allows companies to make a wide range of claims without necessarily providing robust evidence to support them.
    
5. **Placebo Effect**: It's important to consider the placebo effect when evaluating products like these. If someone believes that a product is making their food or drink "energized" or healthier, they may experience subjective benefits simply because of their belief in the product, rather than any actual physical effect.
    
6. **Potential Harm**: While products like these might not directly harm consumers, they could lead people to spend money on products that don't provide any real benefit. In some cases, they may even deter individuals from seeking out more effective treatments or interventions for health concerns.

In pseudoscientific contexts, "BioAngstroms" may be described as units of measurement related to energy or vibrations within the body. Proponents of alternative therapies sometimes use terms like this to lend an air of scientific legitimacy to their claims, but they are often not based on rigorous scientific principles or evidence.

Poor sleep, lack of energy during the day and slow healing are all symptoms of poor cell function energetically. ==The #1 cause of poor cell function today is *electromagnetic overwhelm*, made even more dramatic with the introduction of 5G==.

Restoring and Keeping cell function supported energetically is mandatory today for proper digestion, healthy bone marrow, and virtually all body function. Maximized hydration is foundational for healthy living.

Out of necessity our new Quanta Energy Mugs are ten times more powerful than our previous energy mugs.

Liquids placed into our 13 oz and 25 oz Quanta Mugs ==energize to 255,000 BioAngstroms in just two minutes==. Several if a bottle or container is placed in these mugs. 30-60 minutes for larger containers placed on the mugs.

The NEW Harmony Health ENERGIZER ==Quanta Mug takes energizing liquids to 255,000 BioAngstroms of Cell Supporting energies in just 20 seconds==. A bottle or container of liquid/shake in just 60 seconds. A larger container placed on the NEW ENERGIZER in 6-20 minutes depending on size of container.

The ultimate appliance to ==bring cell supporting life back to virtually any dead food==, fruit, vegetable, or liquid, hot or cold, raw or cooked. And today virtually all of them are dead or negative energy unless revitalized with one of our mugs.

Taste and feel the difference. 6 Month Money Back Guaranty if for any reason you are not fully satisfied with your choice. You will love the result for you and any family members.

# Fred Van Liew

Fred Van Liew, also known as "The Water Doctor," gained some attention for his unconventional views and practices related to water. He has promoted the idea that water can have various health benefits beyond mere hydration, often making claims that go beyond established scientific understanding.

Van Liew has advocated for the consumption of "structured water," which he claims has special properties that make it more beneficial for health compared to regular water. However, the concept of structured water is not recognized by mainstream science, and there is little scientific evidence to support its supposed benefits.

He has also been associated with products and devices that claim to enhance the quality of water, such as water ionizers or devices that claim to "structure" water molecules. These claims are often considered pseudoscientific by experts in the field.

It's important to approach Van Liew's claims and products with skepticism and to rely on scientific evidence when making decisions about health and wellness practices. While some of his ideas may have garnered a following, they are not widely accepted within the scientific community.

A charlatan is typically defined as someone who falsely claims to have special knowledge or skills in a particular field, often for personal gain.

This Doctor told my little sisters that before the flood, squirrels could talk and had to ask Adam for permission to use the bathroom. Furthermore he said that the quantum mug would energies food that was hear it without touching it, but now that he sells energizer plates, the mug doesn't work to energize food anymore. Something fishy is going on. He's making merchandize of gullible women.
