# Public Nuisance

Someone suggested that it's like polluting the water upstream of someone else, and it's not okay because it's effecting others. I don't know, it makes sense.

# Religious Exemption Letter

Date: **Oct 4**, 2021, 9:53 AM

The following verses teach that people should not come in contact with unclean things such as dead animals, blood, bodily fluids, diseases, or anything that has been defiled by such items (Haggai 2: 13, Job 14:4, Leviticus 15:13).

Immunizations present a contrary view of health and well-being by injecting fluids that either contain or have been filled with viruses, animal products, toxic materials, or developed with aborted baby cells. My church has a page dedicated to explaining why taking vaccines are against our church's doctrine and religiously held belief at <https://stedfastbaptistkjv.org/>.

## My Solutions For Continued Employment

1. I present an **antibody test** that has equal or higher antibodies than someone with an injection, because I already had COVID, giving me natural immunity.
2. I can **work from home** until COVID is no longer a threat, eliminating the possibility of infecting someone else with the disease.
3. If insurance will cover the cost, I would be happy to get a **weekly COVID test**.
4. If I must be terminated due to this conflict, is there any chance of **keeping my flight benefits for 10 years** similar to the layoff packages in March 2020?
5. As a last resort, before I leave the airline, can I work from home at least for a couple months to see if there's even **any jobs available** that won't require the vaccine? If I can't find a company that doesn't require it, I would rather take the vaccine than be unemployed, as being jobless would violate other principles in scripture (2 Thessalonians 3:6-12).

My pastor has preached 2 sermons on vaccinations and has written an exemption form explaining available at <https://stedfastbaptistkjv.org/>.

## Americans Can Make Their Own Medical Choices

Date: **Sep 30**, 2021, 3:50 PM

I am not making the choice to leave. I am making the choice to make my own medical decisions, and you're laying me off for it. I will always hate American Airlines for that. I will take the vaccine  and stay awhile longer because I want to travel with Mariana, but **I will always resent you for forcing me to put that in my body**. It was under duress with my job threatened. It has nothing to do with programming, it was nothing to do with work, if you're so worried about the spread of COVID, you shouldn't require everybody to come into the office. **It's not about COVID. It's about kissing Joe Biden's butt to avoid fighting for the basic freedom to make our own medical choices**. I hate American Airlines, I'm not thankful for anything they taught me. I'm thankful for the people I worked with, I'm thankful for my peers and my Seniors, and I'm thankful for the opportunities I had to grow with them, but I hate the company. I hate the board of directors and I hate the CEO. Nobody should be fired because they don't believe in the vaccine. This is worse than racism. **This is vaccine rape. And this company is a rapist. I will never forgive American Airlines for this**.

Remember, Ethan, this was the company God gave you. Who are you mad at? If it's God's will for you not to get the vaccine, than he'll give you another opportunity.

## Mandatory Vaccines

Date: **Aug 25**, 2021, 10:09 AM

The only way I can explain it is a woman that is raped and afterwards screaming, "Get this semen out of my body! Get it out of my body!" That's what I imagine when I get the vaccine. It's strange, I don't understand it, it isn't natural, I don't trust it, I don't trust the FDA, and I don't want it in my body. This company is against sexual misconduct but you're entertaining the idea of vaccine rape at a systematic level. Vaccine rape as a term of employment.

After everything I've done for the company, all the late nights, all the work and headaches, all the obedience and not complaining, they are just going to discard me like a piece of meat because I won't let them rape me with a vaccine.

## Why I don't accept vaccines

Experience is the undefeated frustration of science.
