Walmart: [Six Star Pro Nutrition 100% Creatine Unflavored Powder](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Six-Star-Pro-Nutrition-100-Creatine-Unflavored-Powder/1112528832)
Be sure to get the unflavored one as the berry flavored is too sweet with the protein.

1. All creatine work equally as well. Choose the most affordable which is **creatine monohydrate**.
2. **Saturation**: take 5 grams daily. You will see the effects after 3-4 weeks.
3. **Timing**: It doesn't matter as long as you take it every day.

[Can you gain weight from taking creatine?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/S4p9PvpPAE4)
The weight gain is not fat, it's water weight predominately stored in muscles.

[Does Creatine Cause Weight Gain?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/TUi1U-MPVm8)
I still have body fat and want to lose more weight. Will creatine be counterproductive? No, take the creatine. Take it now. The reason why is because **creatine in itself does not cause you to gain fat**. Overall nutrition will do that. **Creatine can pull a little bit more water into the muscles, but that would just make you look more lean**. So take five milligrams every single day, make progress in your lifts, and watch your body change. I personally think that this is too sweet, so I add a non-flavored one together. Any creatine monohydrate is fine. Good luck!

# You don't lose muscle if you stop taking creatine

[What If You Quit Creatine?!!](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/yyTUs3qKhGg)

What happens if you stop taking creatine? **Creatine does not directly cause muscle growth**. Therefore, when you stop taking it, you're not going to lose any muscle mass. Instead, the saturation levels in your muscles will drop slowly over time. As the effects wear off, you might notice that you're a bit more sore, have a bit less energy, and might appear just a bit less full since you're holding less water.
