Be sure to get the unflavored one as the berry flavored is too sweet with the protein.

[What Happens to Your Body When You Use Creatine](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/yo3ROyDRhCI)
**Creatine fills your body's adenosine triphosphate reserves**, which is a chemical that stores energy and powers your cells to supply energy to your muscles. This boost in energy has been shown to increase muscle size, strength, and power. Excessive dosing is not necessary and may result in negative effects, which can lead to a significant gain in body weight due to an increase in both muscle mass and water retention.

[The Best Time To Take Creatine (Science)](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/tk8d1fuxgRs)

What is the best time to take creatine for muscle growth? You see, creatine is a supplement with long-term effects. If you take creatine now, it will not be in your muscles the next hour. Research shows **it actually takes two full weeks of taking creatine before your muscles get saturated**. The most important thing is that you take about 5 grams of creatine per day, regardless of timing, so that your muscles get saturated with creatine. Now, if you care about optimizing the smallest details, one study found that **taking creatine after training results in slightly better creatine absorption**, likely because we have better nutrient absorption right after training.

[How to Use Creatine For Growth (3 Steps)](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Rf1A1P-oQqI)
1. All creatine work equally as well. Choose the most affordable which is **creatine monohydrate**.
2. **Saturation**: take 5 grams daily. You will see the effects after 3-4 weeks.
3. **Timing**: It doesn't matter as long as you take it every day.

Here is a simple three-step guide on how to properly use creatine.

Step 1: **Type** With so many options available on the market, it can get overwhelming to choose the right type. However, research consistently shows that they all work equally well. So, save your money and go with the most affordable option: creatine monohydrate.

Step 2: **Saturation** It takes time for your muscles to fully saturate with creatine. If you take 5 grams of creatine daily, you can expect to start seeing the benefits after about three to four weeks. Alternatively, you can try a loading phase where you take 20 grams of creatine every day for seven days. This will saturate your muscles in just a week. However, some people may experience stomach discomfort with this method.

Step 3: **Timing** Ultimately, it doesn't really matter when you take your creatine, as long as you're consistent and take it every single day. So, find a time that works for you and stick with it.

Creatine draws water into your muscle cells making them fuller.

[CREATINE to IMPROVE Muscle Performance !? Neuroscientist Dr Huberman](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/AMO7DXeTfq0)

Creatine improves muscle performance. Early on, there was a lot of controversy about creatine. However, 18 studies support the idea that muscle creatine content can be increased by ingesting creatine. Creatine serves as a fuel source for early bouts of high-intensity activity. **It is also a fuel source for neurons in the brain and can have cognitive enhancing effects**.

[CREATINE 101 üí™üèº üß†What does it do and best way to take it? (Explained)](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/UJB6WSobDqs)

What does creatine do and how do you take it? First off, **creatine is probably the best ingredient there is for building muscle**, outside of protein. Creatine builds muscle, strength, endurance, and explosive power. It also holds more water in the muscle cell, giving you the appearance of muscle fullness.

Now, how do you take creatine? You need to take three to five grams of creatine per day. However, if you've never used creatine before, for the first seven to ten days, you should take 20 grams of creatine per day, spread out over four doses of five grams each. Once you've done this for seven to ten days, your muscles are fully saturated with creatine. Once you're fully saturated, you can then go to a maintenance dose of three to five grams per day.

You can take creatine at any time of the day. It doesn't matter if it's first thing in the morning, pre-gym, post-gym, or before you go to sleep. What matters is that you are consistent and take it every day because for creatine to work, your muscles need to be saturated.

# Creatine does not make you fat

[Creatine While Cutting?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/bXl5EhP-pZk)

Do not take creatine if you're trying to lose fat. Creatine increases water retention, leading to a softer, more bloated look, which is the last thing you want when you're trying to get lean. At least that's what some people might try to tell you, even though it's completely untrue. In reality, a cutting phase is the most important time to take creatine because of its effects on preserving strength and muscle fullness, which is especially helpful when you're in a calorie deficit.

It is true that creatine increases water retention, but that's actually one of the key benefits. The extra fluid is stored inside the muscle cell and not directly beneath the skin. So, if anything, this would actually give your muscles a slightly more defined appearance and not the other way around.

Stop overcomplicating creatine. **It's the single most effective and research-supported natural bodybuilding supplement available**, and it should simply be taken year-round, whether you're bulking, cutting, or maintaining.

[Can you gain weight from taking creatine?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/S4p9PvpPAE4)
**The weight gain is not fat, it's water weight predominately stored in muscles**.

So, a lot of people are worried about weight gain if they start taking creatine. For some people, that's perfectly normal. In fact, when creatine is ingested and stored in our muscles, it can attract water, causing an increase in water content in the muscles. This can result in a weight gain of up to one or even 1.5 kilograms for some individuals. However, it's important to remember that this weight gain is not fat; it's water weight. Moreover, the majority of the water weight is stored in the muscles, making them appear larger and better. Many people actually feel that they look leaner when they start taking creatine because their muscles are more pumped. So, it's not fat that causes the weight gain; it's predominantly water weight stored in the muscles.

[Does Creatine Cause Weight Gain?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/TUi1U-MPVm8)
I still have body fat and want to lose more weight. Will creatine be counterproductive? No, take the creatine. Take it now. The reason why is because **creatine in itself does not cause you to gain fat**. Overall nutrition will do that. **Creatine can pull a little bit more water into the muscles, but that would just make you look more lean**. So take five milligrams every single day, make progress in your lifts, and watch your body change. I personally think that this is too sweet, so I add a non-flavored one together. Any creatine monohydrate is fine. Good luck!


# Kidney will not harm your kidneys

[CREATINE: THE HOLY GRAIL OF MUSCLE BUILDING SUPPLEMENTS](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/B2zijzBc2lw)
Creatine, consider it the Infinity Gauntlet of the bodybuilding world. I am inevitable. Creatine is one of the most extensively researched products in the supplement industry, with nearly a century of research behind it. But what about my kidneys, bro? Oh, you're one of those guys, aren't you? Fear not, creatine isn't going to make your kidneys, liver, or any other organs explode. The common misconception that creatine is bad for your kidneys stems from the increase in creatinine in blood markers when creatine is ingested.

When you take creatine, it allows your body to create adenosine triphosphate (ATP) more efficiently as an energy source. As a byproduct of breaking down the creatine, your body produces creatinine. This process is completely natural and nothing to worry about. So, before grabbing the garbage bin over the thought of taking creatine, consider the gains. Creatine has been shown to increase strength, lean muscle mass, and help muscles recover more efficiently over time.

But how much should I take, bro? I thought you'd never ask. Studies show that 3 to 5 grams of creatine daily is enough to provide the benefits you're looking for. Creatine builds up in your system over time, so don't worry too much about when to take it throughout your day. So now that you've heard all that, go grab your creatine and go make some gains.

[Is Creatine safe for you?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/YHBpQEC37Mg)
Creatine is indeed safe for most people. It is not a steroid and can be found naturally in foods such as meat. In fact, the amount of creatine found in a serving of meat is similar to the amount found in a creatine supplement. Creatine is extensively studied and is considered one of the most researched sport supplements.

Contrary to popular misconceptions, creatine does not cause kidney or liver damage. Numerous studies have demonstrated its safety when used within recommended doses. However, it is important to choose a reputable brand and opt for creatine monohydrate, which is the most commonly used and well-studied form of creatine.

It's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian before starting any new supplement to ensure it aligns with your individual health circumstances.

# You don't lose muscle if you stop taking creatine

[What If You Quit Creatine?!!](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/yyTUs3qKhGg)

What happens if you stop taking creatine? **Creatine does not directly cause muscle growth**. Therefore, when you stop taking it, you're not going to lose any muscle mass. Instead, the saturation levels in your muscles will drop slowly over time. As the effects wear off, you might notice that you're a bit more sore, have a bit less energy, and might appear just a bit less full since you're holding less water.

[What is WHEY PROTEIN & CREATINE? Why should you take them?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/7QLyYHa8gcU)

As an AI language model, I don't have personal preferences or the ability to make specific product recommendations. However, I can provide general information.

Whey protein and creatine are indeed two popular and widely used supplements for muscle building and recovery. Whey protein is a convenient source of high-quality protein that can help meet your daily protein needs. It is quickly absorbed by the body and contains all nine essential amino acids.

Creatine, as mentioned before, is a naturally occurring compound that can enhance energy production in muscles, leading to improved performance and recovery. Creatine monohydrate is the most common and well-researched form of creatine.

When choosing supplements, it's important to consider factors such as quality, reputation, and your specific health and fitness goals. It's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian who can provide personalized recommendations based on your individual needs.

Additionally, it's worth noting that while supplements can support your fitness journey, they should not replace a balanced diet consisting of whole food sources. Whole foods provide a wide range of nutrients that are beneficial for overall health and well-being.

[Creatine EXPLAINED üî¨](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/3no2bhPzTh4)

Creatine works by replenishing and enhancing the body's supply of creatine phosphate, a molecule used to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the primary source of energy for muscle contractions during high-intensity activities. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. Natural creatine production: Your body naturally produces creatine in the liver, kidneys, and pancreas, and it is also obtained through dietary sources like meat and fish.
    
2. ATP production: Creatine is converted to phosphocreatine and stored in muscle cells. During intense activities, the stored phosphocreatine donates its phosphate group to ADP (adenosine diphosphate), forming ATP, which provides energy for muscle contractions.
    
3. Supplementing with creatine: By taking creatine supplements, you increase the availability of creatine in your muscles. This allows for a faster regeneration of ATP during high-intensity exercise, leading to improved strength, power, and endurance.
    
4. Loading phase and maintenance: Some individuals choose to undergo a loading phase, where they consume higher amounts of creatine (around 20 grams per day) for a week to quickly saturate their muscles with creatine. Afterward, a maintenance dose of 3-5 grams per day is commonly taken to keep the muscle creatine levels elevated.
    

It's important to note that while creatine can enhance performance, it doesn't replace hard work and proper training. It's still necessary to push yourself in the gym and maintain a consistent exercise routine. If you're considering using creatine or any other supplements, it's advisable to consult with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian to ensure it aligns with your goals and overall health.
