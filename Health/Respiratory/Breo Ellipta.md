# How To Buy It

Due to the heavy lobbying influence in the U.S. Breo cost about 4 times as much to purchase than in Canada. If you have health insurance it ends up being comparable, but if you want to check the prices in Canada, visit [Maple Leaf Meds](https://www.mapleleafmeds.com/drug/breo-ellipta/) and type in the name of the prescription. Simply add it to your cart and upload your prescription.

# How Breo Ellipta Works

**Breo Ellipta** is a combination inhaler used for the long-term treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It works through its two active ingredients: fluticasone furoate and vilanterol.

#### Active Ingredients and Their Mechanisms

1. **Fluticasone Furoate**
    
    - **Type:** Inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)
    - **Function:** Reduces inflammation in the airways.
    - **Mechanism:** It works by inhibiting multiple inflammatory pathways. Fluticasone furoate decreases the release of inflammatory substances (such as histamines, cytokines, and leukotrienes) and suppresses the migration of inflammatory cells into the airways. This action helps to prevent asthma attacks and reduces chronic inflammation in COPD, leading to fewer symptoms and exacerbations .
2. **Vilanterol**
    
    - **Type:** Long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (LABA)
    - **Function:** Relaxes the muscles around the airways.
    - **Mechanism:** Vilanterol stimulates beta2-adrenergic receptors in the bronchial smooth muscle, leading to muscle relaxation. This helps to open up the airways, making it easier to breathe. Vilanterol provides prolonged bronchodilation, which is crucial for maintaining open airways over an extended period, typically up to 24 hours .

#### Combined Effect

When combined, fluticasone furoate and vilanterol work synergistically to control symptoms and improve lung function:

- **Fluticasone furoate** reduces inflammation, which is a key component in both asthma and COPD.
- **Vilanterol** ensures that the airways remain open, improving airflow and reducing the effort needed to breathe.

### Usage and Benefits

- **Asthma:** For individuals 18 years and older, Breo Ellipta helps to prevent asthma attacks and manage chronic symptoms. It is not intended for immediate relief of acute bronchospasm.
- **COPD:** It reduces exacerbations and improves lung function in people with COPD by maintaining open airways and reducing inflammation.

### Administration

Breo Ellipta is used once daily, providing consistent medication delivery over 24 hours. This once-daily dosing can improve adherence compared to medications requiring multiple doses per day.

### Clinical Studies and Effectiveness

Clinical trials have shown that Breo Ellipta effectively reduces the rate of COPD exacerbations and improves lung function in both asthma and COPD patients. It has been found to be more effective in some cases compared to monotherapies of either fluticasone or vilanterol alone .

### Safety and Considerations

- **Common Side Effects:** Include nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, and oral thrush.
- **Warnings:** LABAs, like vilanterol, when used alone, have been associated with an increased risk of asthma-related death. However, the combination with an inhaled corticosteroid mitigates this risk.
- **Monitoring:** Regular follow-ups with healthcare providers are essential to monitor lung function and ensure the medication is working effectively without significant side effects.

### What should I do if I forget a dose?

Inhale the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not use more than one dose in a day and do not inhale a double dose to make up for a missed one ([medlineplus](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a613037.html)).

### Conclusion

Breo Ellipta is a powerful combination inhaler that helps manage and control asthma and COPD by reducing inflammation and keeping the airways open. Its once-daily dosing and proven efficacy make it a valuable treatment option for long-term management of these chronic respiratory conditions .

# Ingredients of Breo Ellipta

Breo Ellipta is a prescription medication used for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is an inhalation powder that contains two active ingredients:

1. **Fluticasone Furoate:** A corticosteroid that reduces inflammation in the airways, helping to prevent asthma attacks and improve breathing.
2. **Vilanterol:** A long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (LABA) that helps to relax the muscles around the airways, making it easier to breathe.

### Nebulizer Solution Considerations

Creating a nebulizer solution as a replacement for Breo Ellipta is not recommended and can be unsafe for several reasons:

1. **Complex Formulation:** Breo Ellipta combines specific doses of fluticasone furoate and vilanterol in a dry powder inhaler. Replicating the exact formulation, dosage, and delivery mechanism in a nebulizer solution is complex and may not be possible outside of a controlled pharmaceutical manufacturing environment.
    
2. **Dosage Precision:** The inhalation powder ensures that patients receive precise doses of the active ingredients. A nebulizer solution may not provide the same precision, leading to either suboptimal treatment or potential overdose.
    
3. **Stability and Efficacy:** The stability and efficacy of the medication in a nebulized form have not been established. The active ingredients might degrade or lose their effectiveness when dissolved in a liquid solution.
    
4. **Safety Concerns:** Nebulizing medications not specifically designed for this purpose can lead to adverse effects, such as improper absorption, irritation of the airways, and unexpected side effects.
    

### Professional Guidance

If you have difficulty using Breo Ellipta or require an alternative form of medication delivery, it is crucial to consult with a healthcare professional. They can recommend appropriate alternatives or adjustments to your treatment plan. Options might include other forms of inhalers, nebulizer solutions specifically designed and approved for asthma or COPD, or oral medications.

### Alternatives

Several medications are available as nebulizer solutions for asthma and COPD management, such as:

- **Budesonide:** A corticosteroid available as a nebulizer solution.
- **Albuterol:** A short-acting beta2-agonist used for quick relief of asthma symptoms.
- **Ipratropium:** An anticholinergic bronchodilator often used in combination with albuterol.

### Conclusion

Replicating Breo Ellipta as a nebulizer solution is not advisable due to the complexities and risks involved. Always consult your healthcare provider for safe and effective alternatives tailored to your specific health needs.

# Weaning Off Breo

Weaning off Breo Ellipta (or any medication) should always be done under the guidance of a healthcare professional. Here are some key considerations regarding your approach and the potential implications:

### Gradual Reduction

Reducing the frequency of Breo Ellipta usage gradually is generally a safer approach compared to stopping abruptly. However, the specific schedule and pace of reduction should ideally be customized by your healthcare provider based on your individual health status and response to the medication.

### Potential Issues with Weaning Off

1. **Symptom Recurrence:** Reducing the frequency of Breo Ellipta may lead to a resurgence of asthma or COPD symptoms. It's important to monitor for any signs of worsening, such as increased shortness of breath, wheezing, or frequency of exacerbations.
2. **Inflammation Control:** Breo Ellipta's corticosteroid component (fluticasone furoate) helps manage inflammation. Less frequent dosing might result in less effective control of airway inflammation, potentially leading to more frequent or severe symptoms.
3. **Medication Resistance:** ==There is no evidence to suggest that altering the frequency of inhaled corticosteroids and LABAs like those in Breo Ellipta would cause the body to become resistant to the medication==. However, improper use can lead to suboptimal control of asthma or COPD, necessitating a return to regular dosing.

### Professional Guidance

1. **Medical Supervision:** Always consult with your healthcare provider before making changes to your medication regimen. They can provide a tapering schedule tailored to your needs and monitor your response to ensure safety.
2. **Alternative Therapies:** Your doctor may suggest alternative therapies or medications to manage your condition if you are aiming to reduce reliance on Breo Ellipta.

### Risk of Worsening Symptoms

If your symptoms worsen during the reduction period, it’s critical to revert to the prescribed daily use and seek medical advice immediately. Uncontrolled asthma or COPD can lead to serious health risks and decreased quality of life.

### Long-Term Management

Some patients may need long-term maintenance therapy for chronic conditions like asthma and COPD. The decision to wean off should be based on a stable period of controlled symptoms and under professional advice. It’s possible to reassess the necessity of daily use periodically.

### Conclusion

While there’s no known risk of becoming resistant to Breo Ellipta by reducing its frequency, managing chronic respiratory conditions requires careful and consistent treatment. Any changes to your medication plan should be made with the guidance of your healthcare provider to avoid potential exacerbations and ensure optimal control of your condition.
