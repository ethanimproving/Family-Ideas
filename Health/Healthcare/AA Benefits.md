# 2023

The enrollment deadline for 2023 is November 5.

## Money Breakdown

### Breo: $1,080

I have to spend $270 for sure every 3 months on [[Chronic Cough|Breo]]. That's a sunk cost that I can use my HSA for, which saves about $216 of tax money.

$$270 * 4 = 1080 * 0.20 = 216$$
### Dr. Chestnut: $408

I have roughly two visits per year to Doctor Chestnut per year, which are $204 per visit. Besides the medication she prescribed, she is my largest medical expense throughout the year.

### Doctor On Demand: $0

When I get a repertory infection, it's cheapest if I make an appointment with Doctor On Demand. It costs me nothing to get a ZPack or Medrol to fight the infection.

### Dr. Coats - N/A

I haven't been to Dr. Coats since 2020. I suppose this trend will continue so I have no need to factor that expense into my considerations.

### Dr. Ashby - N/A

I have been to Dr. Ashby, but he is inexpensive and out of network anyway.

### Dentist: $146

My dentist is $73 per visit.

### Dr. Bunch: $108

My annual eye exam was $108.

### McGuinesss Dermatology: N/A

I go to Dr. McGuinesss once or twice a year for Fordyce Spot extractions. He charges about $35 per session. The first visit was $150.

## Options

### DFW ConnectedCare

#### No HSA

The main knock against this plan is that it is not eligable for an HSA, which guarantees to save me a couple hundred dollars every year.

#### No preferred providers

None of my preferred doctors are in network for this plan, meaning I would have to switch my doctors to make it effective.

#### Breo?

Will it pay for Breo?

### Core Medical BCBS

This is the only plan eligible for an HSA, however I was planning to reimburse myself the $3,600 from Lasik anyway, so I may as well keep that money in the HSA, choose a low deductible plan, and include those HSA contributions into my personal account. This would surrender about $720 in taxes, so that plan is only worth it if I will save more than $720 by choosing a low deductible plan. The paycheck contributions only differ by close to $200, leaving another $520 needing to be saved out of pocket by selecting the [[#DFW ConnectedCare]] plan. However, since I only spend $408 on doctors in a year anyway, it isn't likely I would recover that money. Especially since Dr. Chestnut doesn't appear to be in Network.

You are agreeing to close your UMB HSA and transfer your funds to a Fidelity HSA. (000707113)
