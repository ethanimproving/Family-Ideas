# What Is VBM Gaurd?

VBM Guard (Virus, Bacteria, Mold Guard) is a nebulizer solution designed to protect against respiratory pathogens. It contains ingredients like Melaleuca (Tea Tree Oil), Cineole, Cajeput Oil, Eucalyptus Oil, Clove Bud Oil, Aloe Vera Extract, and a small amount of Hydrogen Peroxide. This blend helps eliminate and protect against viruses, bacteria, and mold in the respiratory system​ ([Access Complete Wellness](https://www.accesscompletewellness.com/vbm-guard/))​.

Here's an overview of its key aspects:

## Composition and Function

VBM Guard contains a blend of essential oils and other natural ingredients known for their antimicrobial properties:

- **Melaleuca Alternifolia Extract (Tea Tree Oil):** Known for its antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal activities.
- **Cineole (from Eucalyptus):** Helps ward off bacteria, mold, and parasites, and has antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties.
- **Cajuput Oil:** Used for treating colds, congestion, skin infections, and pain due to its *anti-inflammatory* properties.
- **Eucalyptus Globulus Essential Oil:** Provides antioxidant protection, stimulates immunity, and improves respiratory circulation.
- **Clove Bud Oil:** Possesses antibacterial, antifungal, and antioxidant properties.
- **Aloe Vera Extract:** Protects mucosal membranes and offers additional health benefits due to its nutrient content.
- **Hydrogen Peroxide (1.5%):** An oxidizing agent that helps kill harmful organisms.

## Mechanism of Action

VBM Guard works by nebulizing these ingredients, allowing them to be inhaled directly into the respiratory system. This approach ensures that the antimicrobial agents reach the lungs, sinuses, and throat effectively, providing a protective barrier and reducing the load of harmful pathogens.

## Credibility and Studies

While essential oils and hydrogen peroxide are widely recognized for their antimicrobial properties, specific studies on the efficacy of VBM Guard as a proprietary blend might not be extensively documented in peer-reviewed scientific literature. However, individual components like tea tree oil and eucalyptus oil have been studied for their health benefits. For example:

- **Tea Tree Oil:** Has been shown to have broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity in various studies​ ([Access Complete Wellness](https://www.accesscompletewellness.com/vbm-guard/))​.
- **Eucalyptus Oil:** Known for its ability to ==improve respiratory conditions== and its antimicrobial properties.

## Inventor and Development

VBM Guard appears to be developed by Access Complete Wellness, a wellness clinic that offers a range of holistic health products and services. Lynn Morales, ND, CBP, ParBP, BAT, is associated with the development and promotion of VBM Guard​ ([Access Complete Wellness](https://www.accesscompletewellness.com/vbm-guard/))​.

## Usage and Benefits

VBM Guard is intended for use via a nebulizer to support sinus, lung, throat health, and overall immunity. It is particularly marketed for use during travel or when there is a high risk of exposure to respiratory pathogens.

## Conclusion

While VBM Guard leverages well-known antimicrobial agents, its specific blend and application as a nebulizer solution offer a targeted approach to respiratory health. The credibility of its efficacy would be strengthened by further clinical studies. For those considering its use, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional, especially if there are underlying health conditions or concurrent use of other medications.

# Recommended Dose

Fill a nebulizer with 3ml of VBM and inhale it for 5 minutes. 2 servings daily, one in the morning and evening at any time. ==If mixture is too strong, dilute with Aloe Vera-juice or water==.
