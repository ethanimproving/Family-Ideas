# Jane G. Goldberg

Jane G. Goldberg, Ph.D., is a holistic health practitioner and researcher who has written about various health-related topics, including oxygenated water. Here's a summary of the science and efficacy of APeX Oxygenated Water based on [her work](https://www.apex-water.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/REPORT-APeX-Water.pdf):

## APeX Oxygenated Water Overview

- **Formulation**: APeX Oxygenated Water is a type of water infused or treated with stabilized oxygen molecules. The product claims to deliver additional oxygen to the body, potentially enhancing cellular oxygenation and overall health.
    
- **Proposed Benefits**: Advocates of APeX Oxygenated Water suggest that it can improve oxygen delivery to cells, enhance immune function, increase energy levels, and support overall well-being.
    

## Scientific Basis

1. **Oxygenation Theory**: The central premise behind APeX Oxygenated Water is that supplementing the body with extra oxygen can improve cellular function and health. Theoretically, this could enhance immune responses and support various physiological processes.
    
2. **Stabilized Oxygen**: The product likely contains compounds designed to stabilize oxygen molecules in water, allowing for prolonged oxygen release when ingested. However, the efficacy and safety of these compounds for human consumption might vary and require scientific scrutiny.
    

## Research and Evidence

- **Limited Clinical Evidence**: While some studies have investigated the effects of oxygen supplementation in medical contexts (such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy), there is limited direct clinical evidence specifically supporting the use of APeX Oxygenated Water for health benefits.
    
- **Anecdotal Reports**: Advocates of oxygenated water products like APeX often rely on anecdotal evidence and testimonials to support their claims of efficacy. However, anecdotal evidence is not a substitute for rigorous scientific research.
    

## Criticisms and Controversies

- **Lack of Scientific Validation**: Critics argue that the claims made about APeX Oxygenated Water and similar products lack robust scientific evidence. Without well-designed clinical trials and peer-reviewed studies, it's challenging to assess their true efficacy and safety.
    
- **Potential Risks**: Some experts express concerns about the safety of consuming stabilized oxygen compounds in water, particularly in large or prolonged doses. Side effects or adverse reactions could occur, especially if the product is used inappropriately or without medical supervision.
    

## Conclusion

While APeX Oxygenated Water and similar products may have garnered attention in certain health and wellness circles, their scientific basis and efficacy remain subject to debate. More research, including controlled clinical trials, is needed to establish whether oxygenated water products provide tangible health benefits beyond placebo effects or subjective experiences. As with any health-related product or intervention, individuals should exercise caution and consult healthcare professionals before incorporating oxygenated water into their routines, particularly for medical purposes.

# Credibility

Unfortunately, there's little evidence to suggest the Apex Water Research Institute is a credible organization. Here's why:

- **Limited online presence:** A credible research institute would likely have a well-established website outlining their research goals, findings, and team members. Searching for "Apex Water Research Institute" doesn't yield any official-looking websites.
- **Lack of affiliation:** Reputable research institutes are often affiliated with universities, government agencies, or other established organizations. There's no mention of such affiliations for the Apex Water Research Institute.
- **Potential bias:** The name "Apex Water Research Institute" suggests a close connection to the Apex Water brand, raising concerns about potential bias in their research.

It's more likely that the "Apex Water Research Institute" is a marketing term used by Apex Water Filters Inc. to lend credibility to their products.
