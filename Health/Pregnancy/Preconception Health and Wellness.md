My girlfriends sister is a doctor in Mexico, and she said that if you want your baby to be healthy with the best genes, the parents need to get into shape at least 3 months before conceiving. No drinking, no junk food, plenty of exercise.

Preconception health and wellness refer to the proactive steps individuals and couples can take to optimize their health and well-being before becoming pregnant. The science behind preconception health emphasizes the importance of achieving and maintaining good physical and mental health to enhance the chances of a healthy pregnancy and a healthy baby.

Key aspects of preconception health and wellness include:

1. **Nutrition:** Ensuring a balanced diet that provides essential nutrients, including folic acid, iron, and calcium, is crucial for both partners. Proper nutrition can support fertility and reduce the risk of birth defects.
    
2. **Physical Activity:** Regular exercise contributes to overall health, helps maintain a healthy weight, and can improve fertility and pregnancy outcomes. Safe exercise during pregnancy is also important.
    
3. **Weight Management:** Achieving a healthy weight range is essential for fertility and reducing the risk of complications during pregnancy. Being underweight or overweight can affect fertility.
    
4. **Stress Management:** Reducing stress through relaxation techniques, mindfulness, and seeking emotional support can improve mental and emotional well-being, which is important for conception.
    
5. **Medical Checkups:** Preconception care includes comprehensive medical evaluations for both partners to identify and address any underlying health conditions or concerns. This can include vaccinations and screenings.
    
6. **Avoiding Harmful Substances:** Eliminating or reducing exposure to substances like tobacco, alcohol, recreational drugs, and environmental toxins is vital to protect fetal health.
    
7. **Prenatal Supplements:** Women of childbearing age should consider taking prenatal vitamins or supplements containing essential nutrients like folic acid.
