Electric neck massagers, also known as neck and shoulder massagers, work by utilizing various mechanisms and technologies to provide a massage-like experience to the neck and surrounding areas. Here's a general overview of how these massagers typically work:

1. **Vibration**: Many electric neck massagers incorporate vibration as a primary massage mechanism. They have built-in motors that create rapid vibrations, which are transmitted to the neck and shoulders when the massager is placed around the neck. These vibrations help relax muscles and improve blood circulation in the targeted area.
    
2. **Heat**: Some electric neck massagers come with a heating function. These massagers have heating elements that warm up and radiate heat to the neck and shoulder region. The heat helps to further relax muscles, increase blood flow, and provide soothing relief for muscle tension and discomfort.
