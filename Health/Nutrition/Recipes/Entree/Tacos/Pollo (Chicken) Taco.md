# Ingredients

-   1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts
-   Juice of 2 limes
-   2 cloves garlic, minced
-   1 teaspoon chili powder
-   1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
-   Salt and pepper, to taste
-   Corn tortillas
-   Salsa, avocado, and lettuce, for serving

# Directions

1) In a small bowl, whisk together the lime juice, garlic, chili powder, cumin, salt, and pepper.
2) Place the chicken breasts in a shallow dish or resealable plastic bag, and pour the marinade over them. Marinate for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours.
3) Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. Remove the chicken from the marinade and discard the excess marinade.
4) Grill the chicken for 6-7 minutes per side, or until cooked through.
5) Let the chicken rest for a few minutes, then slice it thinly.
6) Warm the corn tortillas and fill each one with a few slices of chicken, salsa, avocado, and lettuce.
