# Ingredients

-   1 pound pork shoulder, thinly sliced
-   Juice of 2 limes
-   2 tablespoons chili powder
-   1 tablespoon paprika
-   1 tablespoon cumin
-   1 teaspoon dried oregano
-   Salt and pepper, to taste
-   1/2 cup pineapple juice
-   Corn tortillas
-   Chopped onions, cilantro, and pineapple, for serving

# Directions

1) In a large bowl, whisk together the lime juice, chili powder, paprika, cumin, oregano, salt, pepper, and pineapple juice.
2) Add the pork slices to the bowl and toss to coat in the marinade. Marinate for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours.
3) Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. Remove the pork from the marinade and discard the excess marinade.
4) Grill the pork for 4-5 minutes per side, or until cooked through and slightly charred.
5) Warm the corn tortillas and fill each one with a few slices of pork, chopped onions, cilantro, and pineapple.
