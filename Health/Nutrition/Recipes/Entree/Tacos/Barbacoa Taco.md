# Ingredients

-   2-3 lbs beef chuck roast or beef brisket or [[Barbacoa Braised Shredded Beef|barbacoa meat]]
-   1/2 cup beef broth or water
-   1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
-   4-5 garlic cloves, minced
-   2-3 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, minced
-   1 tbsp ground cumin
-   1 tbsp dried oregano
-   1 tsp salt
-   1/2 tsp black pepper
-   Corn tortillas
-   Toppings (chopped onions, fresh cilantro, lime wedges, etc.)

# Directions

1) 1.  Preheat your oven to 325Â°F.
    
2)  In a bowl, whisk together the beef broth or water, apple cider vinegar, minced garlic, minced chipotle peppers, ground cumin, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.
    
3)  Place the beef chuck roast or brisket in a large baking dish or Dutch oven. Pour the spice mixture over the meat and use your hands to rub the mixture all over the meat.
    
4)  Cover the baking dish or Dutch oven tightly with foil or a lid.
    
5)  Place the baking dish or Dutch oven in the preheated oven and bake for 3-4 hours, or until the meat is very tender and falls apart easily.
    
6)  Remove the baking dish or Dutch oven from the oven and let the meat cool for a few minutes. Use a fork or tongs to shred the meat into small pieces.
    
7)  To assemble the tacos, heat up some corn tortillas in a skillet or on a griddle. Fill each tortilla with some of the shredded barbacoa beef and your favorite toppings (such as chopped onions, fresh cilantro, and lime wedges).
