# Ingredients

- Chicken pieces (thigh, fillet, breast, drumstick, with or without skin)
- Warm water

# Equipment:

- Salad Master EOC (Electric Oil Skeleton) 12-inch skillet
- Timer

# Directions

1. Preheat the skillet:
    
    - Preheat the electric skillet to ==450 degrees== Fahrenheit for 5 to 10 minutes.
    - To check if it's hot enough, sprinkle a little water on the skillet's surface. If it bubbles or evaporates quickly, it's ready.
2. Prepare the chicken:
    
    - Choose any parts of the chicken you prefer (thigh, fillet, breast, drumstick) with or without skin.
    - Remove the skin for a healthier option.
    - No need to add salt or marinate the chicken.
3. Cooking the Chicken:
    
    - Open the skillet lid and place the chicken pieces directly on the skillet's surface.
    - No oil is needed as the titanium-based cookware will utilize the chicken's own juices.
    - Cook the chicken evenly on all sides, using tongs or a fork to flip the pieces.
    - There will be no splashing of oil since no oil is used in this recipe.
4. Frying the Chicken:
    
    - If you want to fry the chicken, ==crack the lid slightly== to allow warm air to circulate while maintaining the heat.
    - Use the timer function of the skillet:
        - Set the timer for ==15 minutes for one side== of the chicken.
        - After 15 minutes, turn the chicken to the other side using a fork.
        - Set the timer for another ==12 minutes at 450 degrees Fahrenheit==.
5. Results:
    
    - After the cooking time, the chicken should be golden brown and crispy on the outside while remaining juicy on the inside.
    - The chicken will release its own oil during cooking, resulting in a delicious fried texture without the need for additional oil.
6. Cleaning the Skillet:
    
    - While the skillet is still hot, pour warm water or hot water into it.
    - Close the lid and let it sit for 5 to 10 minutes to loosen any burnt residues.
    - For easy cleaning, the skillet can be placed in the dishwasher. Alternatively, wash it by hand using regular dishwashing soap.
7. Enjoy:
    
    - Serve the golden brown crispy chicken as a main dish or use it in your favorite recipes.
