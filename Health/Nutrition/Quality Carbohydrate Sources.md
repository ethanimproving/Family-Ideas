# Carbohydrate Sources

When it comes to carbohydrates, the best sources are unprocessed whole foods like:

- Fresh fruit
- Legumes
- Whole grains
- Many vegetables

These foods also contain essential nutrients such as fiber, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.

Foods made with refined grains have fewer of these nutrients, and those loaded with added sugars usually contribute to excess calories and high carb content.
