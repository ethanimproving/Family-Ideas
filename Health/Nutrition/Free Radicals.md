# What Are Free Radicals?

Free radicals are molecules or atoms with unpaired electrons in their outermost shell. Because electrons prefer to exist in pairs, free radicals are highly reactive and can seek to obtain the missing electron by reacting with other molecules. This process can lead to a chain reaction of electron theft, causing damage to cellular structures and potentially contributing to various health issues.

Common types of free radicals include reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS).

# Free Radicals Cause Oxidative Stress

While the body has mechanisms to neutralize and control free radicals, an imbalance between the production of free radicals and the body's ability to counteract them can lead to oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is associated with various health conditions, including inflammation, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, and the **aging process**.

# Where Do Free Radicals Come From?

| Natural cause | External cause |
| ---- | ---- |
| metabolic functions | cigarette smoke |
| exercise | pollution |
| inflammation | pesticides |
| illness or infection | radiation |
| **stress** | industrial chemicals |
|  | ozone |
|  | certain drugs |

# Antioxidants Neutralizing Free Radicals

Antioxidants play a crucial role in neutralizing free radicals by donating electrons without becoming destabilized themselves. A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and other sources of antioxidants helps support the body's defense against oxidative stress.
