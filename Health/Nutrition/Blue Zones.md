Blue Zones are regions around the world where people tend to live longer, healthier lives. These areas have been identified based on studies of communities with high percentages of centenarians. The concept originated from the work of demographer and researcher Dan Buettner, who identified five Blue Zones:

1. **Ikaria, Greece**
2. **Okinawa, Japan**
3. **Ogliastra Region, Sardinia, Italy**
4. **Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica**
5. **Loma Linda, California, USA**

These regions share common lifestyle factors such as a plant-based diet, regular physical activity, strong social connections, and a sense of purpose, all of which are believed to contribute to the residents' longevity and well-being.
