## Effectiveness

Recently in 2018, a double-blind study enrolled 100 patients with male or female pattern hair loss with the **iRestore** phototherapy system (calibrated at 650/660 nm light) covering half their head, and a sham device covering the other half. After 24 weeks of treatment, the low-level/light laser therapy (LLLT)-treated scalp exhibited significantly greater hair coverage than the sham light-treated side (14.2% vs. 11.8%, p < .001). A significantly greater improvement from baseline in <mark class="hltr-yellow">hair thickness, hair count, hair coverage</mark>, and IGA were observed (Fan 2018).

## How it works

Lasers emit wavelengths of light specific to a chromophore in the tissue, causing a targeted thermal response with minimal damage to surrounding tissue. The mechanism by which this occurs is described as photobiomodulation (Fayne 2020).

The iGrow ® and **iRestore** ® are the only devices currently incorporating both laser diodes and LEDs into their design.
