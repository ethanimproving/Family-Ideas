### Miraculous Sore Throat or Laryngitis

1.  Mix 1 heaping Tbs sea salt, 1 Tbs Hydrogen Peroxide, and 4 drops of Covodone Iodine in 8 oz water.
2.  Gargle with the mixture every 10 minutes throughout the day.

### RSV

1.  Put peppermint essential oil behind and in front of the ear.
2.  Use drops of garlic oil in the ear.
3.  Crush two Calcium Lactate tablets into powder and mix into food to fight and clear viral infections.

### Flu

1.  Take 200 mcg of Selenium twice a day, early in the morning and evening. Take 600 mcg twice a day if symptoms are severe.
2.  Take Zinc and 500 mg of Vitamin C daily.
3.  Take 5-10K IU of Vitamin D3 daily.

### Spiked Proteins

1.  Studies have shown that the spike proteins in COVID-19 have five components, including two from snake venoms (King Cobra, Crate Snack Venom) and three sequences of Rabbi's Virus.[^1]
2.  In June 2020, an Italy study found that people with COVID-19 had not only these five components but also 30 venoms from snakes (Coral, various cobra's, marine shellfish toxins, starfish (crown of thorns starfish)).[^2]
3.  EDTA is an acid that can destroy venom and has been studied since 1948. Johnson and NOVA and other companies inject EDTA to destroy venom.
4.  Take 1000 mg of EDTA in the morning and evening to denature these peptides.

### Vaccinated Shedding

1.  Vaccinated people can shed spike proteins into healthy people's endothelia, which controls the flow of blood to the brain. This can cause clots, Sudden Adult Syndrome, and keep oxygen from reaching the heart, liver, kidneys, ovaries, and other organs.
2.  Nitric Oxide from food, such as beets, can help increase oxygen circulation.

### Blocking Spiked Proteins

1.  Beta corona virus often doesn't affect the respiratory system but binds to neuro receptors called nicotinic coline receptors.
2.  Countries are restricting nicotine products to some extent as these receptors are targeted by COVID-19.
3.  Nicotine patches or gum can be used as a preventative measure. Cut a patch in half and wear it on the arm.
4.  Smokers are least often hospitalized and have less severe outcomes. Less than 2% of severe cases are smokers.

### Blood Clots

1.  Take at least 2K NAC (N-Acetyl Cysteine) daily to prevent blood clots.

### Sleep

1.  Take 3-5 mg of Melatonin at night for better sleep.
2.  Take herb valerian root 1 hour before bedtime.
3.  Milk Thistle can help with insomnia. Drink as tea or take as tablets with dinner.

### High Heart Rate (A-fib)

1.  Take 500 mg of Magnesium (1000 mg if 200 lbs) and stop calcium supplements to reverse A-fib.

### Trump Won Code

1.  Take Docs Viral Defense (Pro Active Immune product) to make red blood cells hold oxygen longer, which kills viruses.
2.  Take ReZinc 50 mg twice daily with food.
