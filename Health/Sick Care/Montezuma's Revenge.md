The term "Montezuma's Revenge" is often associated with Mexico, as it is named after the Aztec emperor Montezuma II. The idea is that travelers to Mexico might experience gastrointestinal discomfort due to the adjustment to local cuisine and water sources, and according to local folklore it is linked to Montezuma II taking symbolic revenge against foreign invaders after Spanish conquistadors invaded Mexico. This folklore adds a humorous twist to the discomfort travelers may face when trying new foods and water sources in unfamiliar regions.

This image is from when I traveled to Cancun with Mariana, Ana Karen and Jorge. I drank way too many Pina Coladas at the [[2023-09-04 CUN#Where To Stay|Riu Palace Peninsula]] hotel. We had free unlimited food which was horrible for me. The next day on our way to **Isla Mujeres** Ana Karen went to the Pharmacy to pickup some medicine for my stomach, headache, and [this Electrolit drink](https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/electrolit-hydration-beverage-drink-with-electrolytes-strawberry-kiwi/ID=300420212-product) for me and Jorge. I told Mariana that I felt like I needed to throw up, and she said if I need to than I should. But I was embarrassed to throw up in a public bathroom with people in the stalls nearby. She told me if it needs to go out then it's better for me to go. So I went into the stall and threw up the watermelon I had eaten for breakfast. When I came back Jorge was gone, and the girls told me he followed me into the bathroom and also threw up. He was hungover from the Coco Bongo the previous night. The pills relieved me temporarily, but that night I felt like I had a fever. After a night of sleep I felt better the next day. I still had gastrointestinal discomfort, but the headache was gone. Later the girls joked that Jorge and I were connected for throwing up at the same time.

After we got back I was working on a Sabre defect with my coworker Carol, an elderly lady that I very much enjoy working with. She asked how the trip was, and I explained the humor of my current state of health, and she told me, "Next time you go to CUN, make sure you pack some Imodium. If you still have Montezuma's Revenge go to the pharmacy and get some."
