# **How to make Hydrogen Peroxide solution for your nebulizer**

A quick and simple explanation on how to nebulize and how to prepare a hydrogen peroxide and iodine solution for respiratory virus treatment

In recent years several doctors have begun popularizing this at-home treatment for colds and flu.  They also say it has been proven in use for treating COVID-19.

[Click here to go straight to the recipe.](https://greatdeception.blog/how-to-make-hydrogen-peroxide-solution-for-your-nebulizer/#nebulizer-solution-recipe)

# **Why nebulize?**

Nebulizing makes sense if you think about it.  A respiratory virus enters the body via an aerosol.  These are the tiny droplets of water that are breathed out by those around us.  These droplets gather at the back of the nose or throat and the viruses in those droplets start to multiply.

At some point, the viral load becomes too great for the immune system. You develop symptoms of the cold or flu, which is really your body just increasing the power of the immune response.  Within a few days, you usually recover because your body has done its work.

The nebulizer creates its own aerosol, and by using an antiviral solution, and inhaling to the back of the nose and throat, you are effectively disinfecting your airways.  We are lending a helping hand to our immune system, by killing off some of the viruses with the antiviral solution.

# **How to nebulize?**

There are a few points to bear in mind here:

-   This is an early treatment option, **not a doctor's recommendation** for your particular symptoms.
-   Pay careful attention to the recipe as done incorrectly **it could cause injury**.
-   Use a **desktop-style nebuliser** with a combined nose- and mouth mask.
-   This treatment **does not relieve symptoms** but it should prevent the onset of symptoms or shorten the duration of symptoms.

You need to prepare a solution according to our [recipe](https://greatdeception.blog/how-to-make-hydrogen-peroxide-solution-for-your-nebulizer/#nebulizer-solution-recipe) and place about **10-15ml** into the receptacle for nebulizing.  Then take a seat and then, turning the nebulizer on, breathe normally through the mask.  That means take a **deep breath through your nose and breath out through your mouth**.

Keep this up for 15 minutes at one time, and **up to 4 times a day**.  I personally find that 3 times a day is manageable if experiencing increased symptoms but for a sore throat and early symptoms, once or twice a day should suffice.

It can be used after suspected exposure to a virus when you've been among friends, family, colleagues or customers with symptoms.

This nebulizer is perfect for the whole family and can be bought here for around €40. (I will receive a small commission from this link.)

# **Nebulizer Solution Recipe**

The recipe below will result in an approximate 0.1% Hydrogen Peroxide and 0.9% saline solution:

-   500ml (or 1 pint) filtered water
-   5g (1 tsp) table salt (sodium chloride or Himalayan pink salt)
-   15ml (1 tbsp) 3% Food-grade Hydrogen Peroxide
-   If using **12%** Hydrogen Peroxide then use 1 teaspoon instead of 1 tablespoon.

---

-   Place 500ml filtered tap water into a pan and start to heat.
-   Add the salt and stir until dissolved.
-   Remove the pan from the heat and leave to cool.
-   Once at room temperature add the Hydrogen Peroxide and give a quick stir.

Place the solution in a glass bottle and refrigerate.  The solution prepared and stored in this way can keep for **up to 3-months**.

-   When nebulizing add 15ml of the solution to the receptacle of the nebulizer.
-   Add 1 drop of Lugol's solution to the receptacle.

One drop of Lugol's is sufficient.  Even 1 drop in 30ml is recommended but the receptacles tend to come in 15ml sizes. **Do not use more than one drop as it can sting your eyes.**

# **According to** [**Dr Mercola**](https://www.mercola.com/)**:**

He uses a 0.1% hydrogen peroxide solution and has kept it in refrigeration for 3 months without any adverse effects.

The efficacy of the solution is known to fade with time and so do not make too much in one go.

In his interview with Dr Brownstein, they discussed the percentages of the solution.  Dr Brownstein uses about 0.04% solution but only keeps it in the fridge for 1 month as the efficacy drops off after that.  Dr Mercola noted that he keeps his 0.1% solution for longer and hadn't noticed it drop off so quickly.

The battery-powered, handheld nebulizers were noted to be ineffective.  In treating patients Dr Brownstein found that all patients recovered quickly except for those using these smaller devices.  The suspicion is that they do not create adequate droplet sizes for the treatment.

Lugol's solution contains 5% iodine and 10% potassium iodide which helps with the solubility of iodine.  Iodine itself is commonly used for medical disinfection.
