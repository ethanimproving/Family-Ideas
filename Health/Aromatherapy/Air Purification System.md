Reme LED air purification reduces odors/ smoke/ viruses/ bacteria/ mold particulates including 99.9% efficiency against COVID and has a longer lifespan due to led bulbs.

**The Reme Halo Air Purifier has been extensively tested on the novel coronavirus (commonly known as COVID-19) and found to be 99.9% effective at neutralizing it.** It’s a huge breakthrough. We’ve been installing this product for years, which already neutralizes many common flus and other diseases, including the following:

-   MRSA
-   Strep
-   Listeria
-   Norwalk
-   Bird flu
-   Tuberculosis

When coming into contact with microbials, the naturally occurring molecules break them down, destroy them and then revert them back to harmless water vapour and oxygen. The air purification technology produces 1 quadrillion of these molecules every second, quickly killing any airborne virus or bacteria, including COVID-19. (LONDON)

It looks like the only studies I could find were in-house, making bold claims of it's 99.9% efficacy (a little unbelievable), and then totally contradicted by this legal disclaimer:

DISCLAIMER: The summary and any comments herein are based on the results from an <mark class="hltr-yellow">independent laboratory</mark> study performed under controlled conditions and are <mark class="hltr-red">not in any way medical claims.</mark> The product(s) and technologies described are not medical devices and are <mark class="hltr-orange">not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease, virus or illness</mark>. (RFG)

RFG is [ISO 9001:2015](https://www.iso.org/iso-9001-quality-management.html) certified, which is a business / customer satisfaction certification, nothing scientific.

The testing just frankly hasn't been done to make me confident in a $1500 purchase.
