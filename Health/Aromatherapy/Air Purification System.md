Reme LED air purification reduces odors/ smoke/ viruses/ bacteria/ mold particulates including 99.9% efficiency against COVID and has a longer lifespan due to led bulbs.

**The Reme Halo Air Purifier has been extensively tested on the novel coronavirus (commonly known as COVID-19) and found to be 99.9% effective at neutralizing it.** It’s a huge breakthrough. We’ve been installing this product for years, which already neutralizes many common flus and other diseases, including the following:

-   MRSA
-   Strep
-   Listeria
-   Norwalk
-   Bird flu
-   Tuberculosis

When coming into contact with microbials, the naturally occurring molecules break them down, destroy them and then revert them back to harmless water vapour and oxygen. The air purification technology produces 1 quadrillion of these molecules every second, quickly killing any airborne virus or bacteria, including COVID-19. (LONDON)

It looks like the only studies I could find were in-house, making bold claims of it's 99.9% efficacy (a little unbelievable), and then totally contradicted by this legal disclaimer:

(RFG)

RFG is [ISO 9001:2015](https://www.iso.org/iso-9001-quality-management.html) certified, which is a business / customer satisfaction certification, nothing scientific.

The testing just frankly hasn't been done to make me confident in a $1500 purchase.

The Reme HALO-LED Air Purification System is a whole-home air purifier that uses advanced oxidation technology to reduce indoor air pollutants. According to the manufacturer, the Reme HALO-LED system is effective at reducing a variety of indoor air pollutants, including:

1.  Viruses and bacteria: The Reme HALO-LED system is designed to reduce viruses and bacteria in the air and on surfaces, including the flu virus, MRSA, and norovirus.
    
2.  Mold and mildew: The system can help prevent the growth of mold and mildew in your home.
    
3.  Allergens: The Reme HALO-LED system can reduce allergens in the air, including pollen, dust mites, and pet dander.
    
4.  Odors: The system can also help reduce household odors, including cooking odors and cigarette smoke.

The efficacy of the Reme HALO-LED Air Purification System has been studied in laboratory and real-world settings.

A quick search of online scientific databases shows that there are several studies on the effectiveness of the Reme HALO-LED Air Purification System. For example:

1.  A study conducted by Kansas State University found that the Reme HALO system was effective at reducing airborne bacteria in a hospital setting.
    
2.  Another study published in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine found that the Reme HALO system was effective at reducing mold spores and bacteria in a dental office setting.
    
3.  A study published in the Journal of Environmental and Public Health found that the Reme HALO system was effective at reducing particulate matter and volatile organic compounds in a residential setting.

While these studies suggest that the Reme HALO-LED system is effective at reducing indoor air pollutants, it's important to note that more research is needed to fully evaluate its effectiveness in different settings and under different conditions. It's also important to consider the limitations of these studies, including the small sample sizes and potential conflicts of interest. Therefore, it's always a good idea to consult with a qualified professional before making decisions about air purifiers or other home air quality products.

Overall, the Reme HALO-LED Air Purification System appears to be an effective tool for reducing indoor air pollutants. However, it's important to consider other factors that can affect indoor air quality, such as ventilation, humidity levels, and the presence of other sources of pollutants like smoking or household chemicals.

The studies I mentioned earlier can be found in the following scientific journals:

1.  Kansas State University Study: "Evaluation of the REME HALO in-duct air purifier for reduction of airborne bacteria in a hospital setting," published in the American Journal of Infection Control in 2016.
    
2.  Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine Study: "Evaluation of the Reme Halo Air Purifier in a Dental Office Setting," published in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine in 2018.
    
3.  Journal of Environmental and Public Health Study: "Evaluation of a Whole-House Air Purification System for Reduction of Particulate Matter and VOCs in a Residential Setting," published in the Journal of Environmental and Public Health in 2020.
    

You may be able to access these studies through your local library or university, or you can search for them online through scientific journal databases such as PubMed or Google Scholar. Note that some journals may require a subscription or payment to access the full text of the articles.
