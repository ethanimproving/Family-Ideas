There seems to be nitrogen dioxide increasing in my room with heater use.

# What is Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)?

## Chronic Respiratory Infections 

My room and Anna's room are right next to the Central Heating unit at Leeward, and happen to be the two individuals in the house with chronic respiratory problems. ==I'm wondering if the higher levels of NO2 are the root cause of the chronic coughing and breathing problems we both share==.

# October 2023 Correlation

NO2 Levels went from 6 parts per billion (ppb) to 155ppb October 28, right about the time it started getting cold when we would have turned our heater on.

| Date       | [High](https://www.wunderground.com/history/monthly/us/tx/dallas/KDAL/date/2023-10)  | Low  | NO2 (ppb) |
|------------|-------|------|-----------|
| October 27 | 86°F  | 64°F | 6         |
| October 28 | 65°F  | 58°F | 118       |

# Winter Freeze Correlation

Sunday the 14th the high dropped to 21F, down from 62F the previous day.

| Date          | High  | NO2 (ppb) |
|---------------|-------|-----------|
| January 13    | 62°F  | 248       |
| January 14    | 21°F  | 311       |

This drop in temperature was followed by an increase in NO2 levels the same day, climbing to 341ppb the following day. The conjecture of my observation is that NO2 levels increase as the heater works harder.

# How To Reduce NO2 Levels

## Use Carbon Filter

To reduce nitrogen dioxide in your room, place an air purifier near the air intake to capture any pollutants. Air purifiers with HEPA filters can capture particles, but they might not effectively filter out gases like nitrogen dioxide. For gas removal, activated carbon filters are more suitable. Look for an air purifier with both HEPA and activated carbon filters for comprehensive air cleaning.

Activated carbon is effective in adsorbing gases like nitrogen dioxide. The porous structure of activated carbon attracts and traps gas molecules, helping to reduce their concentration in the air as it passes through the filter in the air purifier. This can contribute to improving indoor air quality.

## Call Maintenance Guy

Nitrogen dioxide can result from combustion processes, so it might be emitted by the heater. To ensure N02 isn't leaking out of the machine right next to my room, it may be a good idea to ensure the heater is well-maintained with an inspection.
