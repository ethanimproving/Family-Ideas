# Air Quality Parameters

Also called, "air quality indicators," these parameters are used to assess and quantify the composition and cleanliness of the air in a specific location. Some common air quality parameters include:

| Parameter                         | Normal Range             | Description                                                                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| ==Temperature==                       | Variable                 | Affects indoor comfort and can influence pollutant behavior.                                                                |
| ==Humidity==                          | 30-60% RH                | Can impact indoor air quality and comfort.                                                                                  |
| Air Pressure                      | 980-1,020 hPa            | Air pressure can influence the movement of outdoor pollutants indoors.                                                      |
| Formaldehyde                      | < 0.1 ppm (short-term)   | A volatile organic compound often monitored in indoor air quality due to emissions from building materials and furnishings. |

## AQI

AQI stands for "Air Quality Index." It is a standardized system used to communicate the quality of air in a specific location to the public in an easily understandable way. The AQI provides information about how clean or polluted the air is and what associated health effects might be of concern for different levels of air pollution.

The AQI typically measures several key air pollutants, including:

1. **Particulate Matter (PM2.5 and PM10):** Fine and coarse airborne particles.
2. **Ground-level Ozone (O3):** A major component of smog.
3. **Carbon Monoxide (CO):** A colorless, odorless gas.
4. **Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2):** A gas produced by combustion processes.
5. **Sulfur Dioxide (SO2):** A gas produced by burning fossil fuels.

Each of these pollutants is assigned an AQI value based on their concentration in the air. The AQI values are divided into categories, usually ranging from "Good" to "Hazardous," with corresponding color codes. These categories help individuals quickly understand the potential health risks associated with the current air quality in their area.

For example, a "Good" AQI indicates that air quality poses little or no risk to health, while an "Unhealthy" AQI suggests that people with respiratory or heart conditions, children, and the elderly may be at risk of health effects, and the general public may not be affected.

Local environmental agencies or governmental organizations often calculate and report AQI values regularly, allowing residents to make informed decisions about outdoor activities and take appropriate measures to protect their health when air quality deteriorates.

# Triggers

## PM2.5

### Cooking

Today, I noticed an unusual reading on my uHoo sensor. While diffusing lavender essential oils, I was surprised to see an increase in PM2.5 levels. Initially, I thought this could be related to the essential oil. However, upon reflection, I realized that someone started cooking at the same time.

Cooking activities, especially frying or sautéing, can release **fine cooking aerosols and particles** into the air, leading to elevated PM2.5 levels. It's likely that the spike in PM2.5 was due to cooking, not the essential oil.

I'll continue monitoring the air quality and consider improving ventilation when cooking to maintain a healthier indoor environment.


[Aerosols](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/aerosols/default.html#:~:text=Aerosols-,Aerosols,be%20manufactured%20or%20naturally%20occurring.): An aerosol may be defined as a suspension of particles or **droplets in the air** and includes **airborne dusts, mists, fumes or smoke**. Suspended particle sizes may range from a few nanometers to hundreds of micrometers in diameter and particles can be manufactured or naturally occurring.
