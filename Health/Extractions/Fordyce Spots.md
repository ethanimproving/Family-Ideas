My dermatologist (Dr. McGuiness) charges $35 to extract about 7 Fordyce Spots. Supposedly about 70% of men have these spots, some just grow them larger than others for unknown reasons. It is caused because the sebum that comes to secrete the hair follicles get clocked

# Inject Each Spot with Anesthesia

Dermatologists often use local anesthesia or numbing agents to minimize pain during minor procedures such as extracting milia or Fordyce spots. The injection of a local anesthetic, such as **[lidocaine](https://www.amazon.com/Disposable-Sterile-Syringe-1-5inch-Needle/dp/B0BF9XDYY9/ref=asc_df_B0BF9XDYY9)**, can help numb the area and make the procedure more comfortable for the patient. Additionally, it can reduce bleeding by constricting blood vessels in the targeted area.

Before any procedure, your dermatologist will typically discuss the steps involved, potential discomfort, and the use of any numbing agents or anesthesia. If you have concerns about pain or bleeding, it's important to communicate with your dermatologist, who can address your specific needs and provide a more comfortable experience. Always follow your dermatologist's post-procedure care instructions to ensure proper healing and minimize the risk of complications.

# Make The Incision

Dermatologists typically use specialized instruments for procedures like extracting milia or Fordyce spots. Milia are small, white bumps that usually occur on the face, while Fordyce spots are sebaceous glands that can appear as small, yellowish or flesh-colored bumps and are commonly found on the genitals, including the scrotum.

For the extraction of such lesions, dermatologists may use:

1. **Comedone Extractor:** This tool has a loop on one end that can be used to gently press out the contents of the milium or Fordyce spot.
    
2. **Lancet or Scalpel:** Dermatologists may use a sterile lancet or scalpel to make a small incision in the skin over the lesion, allowing them to express the contents.
    
3. **Fine-tip Forceps:** Fine-tip forceps can be used to grasp and remove the material from the lesion.
    

Your healthcare provider will make a tiny incision (cut) on the skin overlying each millium by using a scalpel or needle. They will then gently extract the cyst using a tool such as a comedone extractor, tongue blade, or small surgical forceps.

It's important to note that attempting to extract these lesions at home can lead to infection, scarring, or other complications. It's always recommended to consult with a dermatologist or healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment. They have the necessary expertise and sterile equipment to perform such procedures safely.

# Patch Up With Sterile Gauze Pads

It's possible that the white patches your dermatologist used at the end of the procedure were adhesive wound dressings or [sterile gauze pads](https://www.cvs.com/shop/cvs-health-sterile-gauze-pads-prodid-1011784). One common type of adhesive dressing is called "Steri-Strips" or "Steri-Plast," and these are thin, adhesive strips used to hold the edges of a wound or incision together. They provide support to the wound and help reduce tension, promoting proper healing.

Another possibility is that your dermatologist used sterile gauze to cover the treated area. Sterile gauze is a common material used in wound care. It helps absorb any oozing or discharge from the treated site and provides a protective barrier.

The specific name of the product used can vary, and without more details, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact type of dressing. If you have any concerns about the dressing or if you need to know more about aftercare instructions, it's best to contact your dermatologist's office for clarification. They can provide you with information specific to your procedure and guide you on how to care for the treated area at home.
