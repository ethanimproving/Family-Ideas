I haven't had seasonal allergies until this year. Carol and Kritika suggested [[Sore Throat Treatment#Allergies|medication for allergies]].

# 3 Stages
## 1. Allergies
Sep 19 - Oct 3

Allergies are your body's immune system's reaction to allergens like pollen, dust, or ragweed. Allergies can cause symptoms such as sneezing, runny or stuffy nose, itchy or watery eyes, and possibly a sore throat. Allergies are typically not associated with green mucus or a cough on their own.

## 2. Infection
Oct 4 - Present

The presence of green mucus can often be a sign of a **respiratory infection**, like
1. A sinus infection
2. Or a cold.

Green mucus may **indicate that your immune system is fighting an infection**. It's important to be evaluated by a healthcare professional to determine the exact cause of your symptoms.

## 3. Productive Cough
Sep 20 - Oct 19

## 4. Dry Cough
Oct 20 - Present

A persistent cough can be caused by various factors, including:
1. Post-nasal drip.
2. Irritation from allergies.
3. The remnants of an infection.

If the cough is **unproductive** and lingers after other symptoms have improved, it could be due to [[Chronic Cough|irritation or inflammation in the airways]].


My pulmonologist has been prescribing Breo to me due to airway inflammation. After I got COVID in Feb 2020, I developed an asthmatic lung issue where even though there is no damage to my lungs, my airways get inflamed and cause an unproductive cough. The official term is bronchial hyperresponsiveness. The Breo helps so I don't notice it in general, but after a cold or a repertory infection, I always have a lingering residual cough for a few weeks despite the Breo. This may be related to post-infectious or post-inflammatory airway hypersensitivity. Here's an explanation:

1. **Post-Infectious or Post-Inflammatory Airway Hypersensitivity:** After a respiratory infection, especially in individuals with pre-existing asthma or airway hypersensitivity, the airways can become more sensitive and reactive. This heightened sensitivity can lead to a lingering cough even when the initial infection has cleared. ==This condition is sometimes referred to as "post-viral cough" or "post-infectious cough."==
    
2. **Asthmatic Response:** I developed an asthmatic lung response following COVID-19. In asthma, the airways become inflamed and narrow, making them more sensitive to various triggers, including infections, allergens, and irritants. Even if there's no structural damage to the lungs, the airway inflammation can persist and lead to symptoms like cough, wheezing, or shortness of breath.
    
3. **Breo (Fluticasone/Vilanterol):** Breo is a combination medication containing an inhaled corticosteroid (fluticasone) and a long-acting beta-agonist (vilanterol). It helps reduce airway inflammation and relax the airway muscles. It's commonly prescribed to manage asthma symptoms and reduce the risk of exacerbations.
    

Doctors may recommend additional measures to manage the cough, such as adjusting medication dosages, using a short-acting bronchodilator for acute relief, or considering other therapies if necessary.
