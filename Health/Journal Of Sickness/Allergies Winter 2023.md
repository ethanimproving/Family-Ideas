The weather suddenly got hot on Friday and I developed a sore throat. My tongue felt like a sharp burning blade cut me on the left side while I was eating Sobritos chips from Mexico.

The next day I went to Oakmore to get it up to code before closing, and I did not feel great.

Then the next Sunday I woke up, blew my nose, and felt much better. So I went to church, felt a little dizzy, but at the end of the day was fine.

It could have been induced by the weather changes, Nitrogen Monoxide in my room, stress from closing on the house. Who knows.
