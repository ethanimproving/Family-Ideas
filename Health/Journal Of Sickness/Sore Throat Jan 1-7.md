Last night I was sitting in the living room talking to Faith, and I suddenly felt uncomfortable in my throat. My the time I went to bed I realized I had a sore throat. I woke up the next day feeling worse.

## Sore Throat

I still have a sore throat today. It feels strained when I yawn, like I'm trying to stretch a sore muscle. 

## Dr. Visit

I went to see Dr. Chesnut today. She gave me a prescription for antibiotics and steroids to knock me out of my typical cycle before it begins. The sickness hasn't reached my lungs yet. I'm just now getting the slightest urges to cough, but not enough yet that it's uncontrollable.

## Losing Voice

I started talking today despite the discomfort of swallowing my own saliva. At first my voice was deep. Then Caleb knocked on my door and chatted for 20 minutes after the Coombs left, an it was too much for me. My voice dried up and now it sounds like a dehydrated crusader traveling through a desert that hasn't had water in 2 days.

## Ear Pressure

My left ear feels exactly like it did after I got off the plane from that one place and had ear pressure for days. It's super annoying, with the constant need to pop it, but it won't pop.

## Farting

Up until today I've also been farting a lot. It started with burping, and my stomach felt empty every time I burped.

Today I still woke up with a strained throat, but after taking my antibiotics it feels much better. My ears are almost unbearable to the point where I could not lean my head in the direction of my TV, so I laid on my left with a pillow against it firmly. After a few hours there was a slight cracking, and immediately it felt amazing, but quickly returned to the state of pain. I've had this before when I came home sick from the Bahamas with Faith. My ears had pressure for days. It was awful.

Yawning is getting closer to cracking it than anything else. It still feels like there's 7 marshmallows stuffed up my ears. I'll miss church tomorrow.
