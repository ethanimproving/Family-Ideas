Last night I was sitting in the living room talking to Faith, and I suddenly felt uncomfortable in my throat. My the time I went to bed I realized I had a sore throat. I woke up the next day feeling worse.

## Sore Throat

I still have a sore throat today. It feels strained when I yawn, like I'm trying to stretch a sore muscle. 

## Dr. Visit

I went to see Dr. Chesnut today. She gave me a prescription for antibiotics and steroids to knock me out of my typical cycle before it begins. The sickness hasn't reached my lungs yet. I'm just now getting the slightest urges to cough, but not enough yet that it's uncontrollable.

## Losing Voice

I started talking today despite the discomfort of swallowing my own saliva. At first my voice was deep. Then Caleb knocked on my door and chatted for 20 minutes after the Coombs left, an it was too much for me. My voice dried up and now it sounds like a dehydrated crusader traveling through a desert that hasn't had water in 2 days.

## Ear Pressure

My left ear feels exactly like it did after I got off the plane from that one place and had ear pressure for days. It's super annoying, with the constant need to pop it, but it won't pop.
