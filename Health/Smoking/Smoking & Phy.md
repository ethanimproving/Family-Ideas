# Vitamin C and Smoking

The nicotine in smoking is actually one of the best **[[Mitochondrial Uncoupling|mitochondria uncouplers]]** that's ever been discovered. Why don't we see the **oxidative stress** and the cancers in people who smoke in the [[Blue Zones|blue zones]]? It's because the rest of their diet facilitates the absorption of the oxidative stress in these guys.

We're one of the few animals that don't make vitamin C. Unfortunately, collagen breaks as blood vessels flex and contract, primarily breaking at bends. When that collagen breaks, vitamin C normally rebuilds it. ==In smokers, they don't have vitamin C because it has been used up in handling oxidative stress==. So they have basically raw collagen that sits out, and then we start the process of an inflammatory attack, and cholesterol is basically a spackling compound that just keeps spackling that area. The great news about smoking is that it always happens at **these bends where flexion occurs**. If, like people in the blue zones who live a very long time as smokers, ==you have huge amounts of vitamin C-containing foods in your diet== (and incidentally, **olive oil** doubles our own vitamin C production, which is kind of cool) ==then you mitigate those effects, and you don't see the negative effects of smoking; you actually see the positive effects of nicotine==.




Yeah, that's all been done in the blue zones. Well, blue zones are not research studies. In fact, you've been quite critical of blue zones even in your book. Yeah, for instance, let's take Sardinia, for example. One of the blue zones. Only the people who live up in the mountains actually have longevity. The people who live down by the water don't.

# Counter Arguments

Is there research that backs up whether changing someone's diet to have high vitamin C content negates their risk of smoking? 'Cause I've never seen that.

**Attributing longevity in Blue Zones to smoking in combination with Vitamin C is highly speculative and lacks scientific evidence.** Blue Zones are known for their healthy lifestyle habits, including diet rich in fruits and vegetables, physical activity, and strong social connections. To attribute their longevity to smoking, even with Vitamin C, overlooks the multitude of other contributing factors and risks misinterpreting correlation as causation.
