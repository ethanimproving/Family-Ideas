[Mitochondrial uncoupling](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/8/8/795) is a process that disrupts the usual way that mitochondria generate energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate). Instead of using the proton gradient created by the **electron transport chain** to power ATP production, ==protons leak across the inner mitochondrial membrane, dissipating the energy as heat==. This can be helpful in certain situations, but it also comes with some drawbacks.

Mitochondrial uncouplers are substances that disrupt the natural process of energy production in the cell, leading to increased heat generation and **potential calorie burning**. While nicotine does exhibit weak uncoupling properties, its mechanism differs significantly from dedicated uncouplers like [2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3550200/), and its effectiveness at calorie burning is negligible compared to the substantial health risks it poses.
