There’s actually a ton of multi-disciplinary research done on earthing when it comes to inflammation reduction and organ function.[^1]

# Test Grounding with A Volt Meter

A YouTube short titled "[About grounding and why I don’t wear shoes anymore. We are electrical beings.](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/swdVPOBLYP0)" shows the electrical discharge into the earth when you touch grass with your bare feet.

In another YouTube short titled "[Discover the Power of Grounding: Connection to Earth's Energy Unlocks Body's Potential](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/3MYM-FCabW4)" Joe Rogan interviews [Gary Brecka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFio155APgU) (see [How Gary Brecka Fixed Dana White's Health](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0EEC891CM8)). It has met some criticism from Chris Masterjohn, PhD in a video titled "[Fact-Checking Gary Brecka on Rogan: A Deep Dive into MTHFR and Methylation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMPvCiOkEtQ)".
# Documentary

"[The Earthing Movie: The Remarkable Science of Grounding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44ddtR0XDVU)" is a documentary film directed by Steve Kroschel, released in 2013. The film explores the concept of "earthing" or "grounding," which suggests that connecting with the Earth's natural energy by walking barefoot on the ground or using conductive devices can have various health benefits.

The documentary features interviews with scientists, researchers, and individuals who have experienced positive effects from practicing earthing. It delves into scientific studies that investigate the physiological effects of grounding, such as reduced inflammation, improved sleep, and increased overall well-being.

"Earthing Movie: The Grounded" aims to raise awareness about the potential health benefits of reconnecting with the Earth's energy and encourages viewers to consider incorporating grounding practices into their daily lives. It has garnered attention from those interested in holistic health, natural healing methods, and alternative therapies.

# Grounding in Soil vs. Concrete

Grounding, which involves making direct contact with the earth's surface, can work effectively in both soil and concrete, but there are some differences to consider.

1. **Soil Grounding**: Soil is an excellent conductor of electricity, especially when it's moist. When you walk barefoot on soil, the moisture content and the composition of the soil allow for the transfer of electrons between your body and the earth, which helps discharge excess electrical charge and balance the body's polarity.
    
2. **Concrete Grounding**: Concrete, being a man-made material, is not as conductive as soil. However, it still retains some conductivity, especially if it's moist or if it contains certain additives. Walking barefoot on concrete can still allow for some grounding effect, though it may not be as effective as soil grounding.
    

In both cases, the key is making direct contact with the ground to allow for the flow of electrons between your body and the earth's surface. While soil provides a more natural and effective grounding experience, concrete can still offer some benefits, particularly in urban environments where soil may not be readily accessible.
