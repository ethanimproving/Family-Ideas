The next step will be a Technical Phone Screen. Please find some information below to help you prepare for your Technical Phone Interview. Remember, this will be 1 hour in length (half technical, half behavioral and likely a live coding exercise). Please feel free to reach out to me at any time should you have any questions. I’m here to help!


**1. Technical/coding and design questions:**These questions will test your ability to solve a technical problem. If you are rusty, you should study up on:

- [ ]   Trees (binary/red black trees/N-ary trees, tree symmetric (inverse image), tree traversal, sorting trees)
    
	- [ ] Iterative Depth First Search
    
    - [ ] Recursive Depth First Search
    
    - [ ] Breadth First Search
    
- [ ]   hash maps, stacks/queues/heap/priority que
    
- [ ]   link lists/reverse link lists (space vs time)
    
- [ ]   recursion/recursive strings
     
	 - [ ] Base case
	 
- [ ]   binary search
    
- [ ]   Arrays - 2d/3d
    
- [ ]   graphs/graph traversal
    
- [ ]   Big O notation
    

**Some tools you might find useful to study up for the coding portion include:**

-   [https://leetcode.com/](https://leetcode.com/)
    
-   [https://www.hackerrank.com/](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
    
-   [https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Insiders-Guide/dp/1479274836](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Insiders-Guide/dp/1479274836)
    
-   [https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X)
    
-   [https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/) – these are the tools that we use to develop amazon services/products.
    

**2. Behavioral questions using our [https://www.amazon.jobs/principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/principles)**

For the behavioral questions, you’ll want to read through the Leadership Principles to become familiar with them (you don’t need to memorize them). Have a few specific examples prepared that you can potentially use to address the questions. It’s good to think of examples regarding projects you’ve done at work, teams you’ve worked with, and products you’ve shipped/delivered (don’t share anything that is considered confidential).

**Here a few Overall Tips to be best prepared for the phone interview:**

-   Remember to ask clarifying questions—treat the interviewer as you would a customer. Do you have all the information needed to go ahead and solve the posed questions? Amazonians are customer obsessed so always work backwards from what the customer needs are.
    
-   Is there any assumptions that need to be confirmed? If so confirm them before moving forward, but also act when you have enough info.
    
-   They would love you to dive as deep as you can go. Remember to answer the question, and think out loud. In some cases you may have a live link to sketch out your answer but generally its by phone. Make sure you give the interviewer your full attention—don’t have interruptions or don’t type or search the internet for answers, be open and honest about what you know or don’t know and do your best. We want someone that can interface with customers honestly so it is an important part of the phone interview to listen and try to answer.
    
-   The screener will try and get a sense of your ability and scale of experience. This phone screen determines the level of your experience either an Ops Engineer II or Ops Engineer III, or could recommend another role.
    
-   Both roles are critical, so don’t worry, but I’ve put some of the key parts of the roles below so you can think about solving problems in the area of OS from Front end through to back, problem solving and including storage, network bottlenecks, scale, capacity management, compatibility, future loads….In other words Best Practice.
    
-   Anything on your resume is FAIR GAME for an interview. Please make sure you can speak to your experience on your resume.
