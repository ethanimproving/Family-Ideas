# Steven Hawking

IQ is for losers, the only thing that matters is applied intelligence. This is why Elon Musk is the most intelligent person on the Earth.

The great Professor Stephen Hawking once talked about how IQ scores are for losers. They found this kid in India with an IQ score higher than me. Cool, but what has he done? Nothing. So, ==what matters is intelligence applied to the real world to see results==. That's why I believe Elon Musk to be the single smartest man on the planet right now. He is the Leonardo Da Vinci of our time, and there are going to be tributes to him sung through myth and legend when our old ways of storing data are defunct and useless. Elon Musk is the man. I don't know what his IQ is - 160, 120, 180 - it doesn't matter.

# The Eternal Rewards Multiplier of Applied Knowledge

[Mens Preaching Night | Stedfast Baptist Church](https://rumble.com/v44f625-mens-preaching-night-stedfast-baptist-church.html?start=6279)

> [!bible] [Revelation 22:12 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Revelation+22:12?translation=kjv)
> 12. And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward
is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.


You can go soul-winning for 4 hours instead of 2, but that's addition, not multiplication. I'd rather do the same amount of time but earn more rewards per the time that I am using out doing something for the Lord. I want you not to add more, but to multiply more.

> [!bible] [2 Peter 1:11 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/2+Peter+1:11?translation=kjv)
> 11. For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.

How do we do that?

> [!bible] [2 Peter 1:5-8 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/2+Peter+1:5-8?translation=kjv)
> 5. And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;
> 6. And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;
> 7. And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.
> 8. For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Let's look at this list as a roadmap:
1. Get saved (faith)
2. Start cleaning up your life
3. Dig into the doctrine
4. Self-restraint through faith
5. When you've been doing this for a long time you develop patience.
6. When you've done all those 5 things, you are godly.
7. The most charitable thing you can do is give someone the gospel. 

There's no rewards for having the biggest brain. But there are rewards for when that knowledge is applied to your life. How do you figure out how to cleanup your life? Knowledge from the Bible. How do you figure out that you need patience? Knowledge from the Bible. 

Where does faith come from?

> [!bible] [Romans 10:17 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Romans+10:17?translation=kjv)
> 17. So then faith cometh by hearing, and ==hearing by the word of God==.

How do you had to your faith? Well, how did you get it originally? By hearing the Word of God. How do you add to it? Add faith by hearing the Word of God and applying it to yourself.
