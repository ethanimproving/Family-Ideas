> Women need dramatically more sleep than men. A man can get away with 7-8 hours. Sometimes you need 6. I don't encourage 6, but the idea is a woman needs 9-10 hours. The key is what's called **hormonal reserves**. Women depend so much on their adrenals to produce even daily hormones. A man does not. Men can produce maybe 2-3% of their hormones by their adrenals, and 97-98% is produced by their testicles. Testicles work if you're sleeping or not. Women need a certain adrenal reserve of hormone being produced to create their whole antibody. Women need a lot more sleep than men. Women need uninterrupted sleep. Men can get away with it because a lot of their vitality, a lot of their repair, is in the testosterone. It's mainly made by the testicle. Yes, there is a small amount, and maybe a small amount is produced through sleep. But I can tell you right now, men need a lot less sleep than women. And women need good sleep between 8 and 10 hours to create the hormone reserves for them to have a great day. ~ [Dr. Patrick Flynn](https://www.tiktok.com/@dr_patrick_flynn/video/7193786780905164074) 


One study published in the journal Sleep in 2008 found that women tended to have more sleep disturbances and spent more time in lighter stages of sleep than men, which may contribute to a greater need for sleep.

Another study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2017 found that women who were sleep-deprived had higher levels of inflammation and a greater risk of developing health problems like heart disease, diabetes, and depression compared to men who were sleep-deprived. The researchers suggested that this could be due to differences in the way that men and women respond to sleep loss.

While these studies do not specifically support Dr. Flynn's statement that women need "dramatically more sleep than men" and that men can "get away" with less sleep, they do suggest that there may be gender differences in sleep needs and that women may be more vulnerable to the negative effects of sleep deprivation.
