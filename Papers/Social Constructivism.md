For some reason I learn the best through watching debates. I learned plenty science watching theist vs atheist debates, partially through listening to the debaters, and partially because it made it have a use to learn science, so it became interesting to me. Same with nutrition. I learn best watching doctors debate with other doctors and they seem to make everything make more sense in debate style than in lecture style. Is there academic research into my style of learning? A term for it? What implications does it have on me?

My preferred learning style aligns with a more interactive and dynamic approach known as "social constructivism." This learning theory suggests that knowledge is constructed through social interaction and collaboration. While there may not be a specific term for learning through debates, your engagement in discussions might enhance critical thinking and understanding, fostering a deeper grasp of the subject matter.

# Pressure To Speak Clearly

There is a pressure during debates to articulate yourself with maximum clarity which pushes the professors to say things simply and straightforward. Something that didn't make sense in a 45 minute lecture makes perfect sense delivered to an opponent as a one-liner in a "gotcha."

# Challenge

You also have someone right there to challenge what the professor is saying. They ask the questions, "How do you know that?" So if a person isn't an expert it becomes very obvious who doesn't know what they're talking about. And it's a healthy skepticism because if they do know how they know their claim, it's an education opportunity for the entire audience to upgrade from having "blind faith" in their textbook to understanding how these facts were ascertained in the beginning. And you can decide for yourself if that level of evidence is strong enough for you to accept it, rather than relying on a schoolboard to come to those conclusions on your behalf, injecting all of their biases into their standard of evidence.

Neil deGrass Tyson is very good at this. I saw a clip of him explaining how we figured out the earth's circumference, and it was brilliantly simple. That's something most people read in a textbook and believe without asking, "How does the textbook know?" But it only takes a minute to explain, "You put a well in the ground to determine when the sun is directly above you, and call your friend a hundred miles away to check when the sun is directly above his well, and you do these geometry equations to find the circumference."

# Toxicity

This style of learning, unfortunately, can became toxic when the only videos to go viral are [videos that attack other people or promote controversy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4yZQZf2g5Y), as observed by Doctor Mike. Controversy garners attention (and more importantly *retention*), but with it comes conflict. We need to find a way to affectively engineer "conflict" in education for the sake of creating interest, while at the same time preventing a culture of conflict. Arguments should be engaging and fun. Michio Kaku talks about the importance of argument, that argument is good and healthy.Â  When two ideas are opposed they should argue and may the best idea win. There is a respectful way to engage in the conflict of ideas without debasing the idea defender. That is what we need to learn on social media, and if we can, than we can extract the attention-grabbing properties of conflict while filtering out the toxic properties of ad hominem attacks.

It'd be sad to see all the educational channels on TikTok remove themselves so the app in America is left only with dances and TikTok challenges. I rarely use it anyway but when I do I'd prefer the addictive qualities of soundbites to feed into microlearning instead of doom-scrolling.
