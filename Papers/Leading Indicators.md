I had a goal to get 20 units that year. My mentor was like, "Nah, don't set those goals. That's what you call a lagging indicator. You need to set goals around. You need to set goals around what's known as your leading indicator. Things that you can control." You can control time, how much content you input into your body, you control these things. Set goals around that. The byproduct of my standards and expectations was 82 units that year.

Malcolm Gladwell wrote a book called Outliers where he did a research study where he looked at the concept of math, and it turns out the Asian students had better grades in math, but the reason being is that the leading indicator was that on average the Asian students would spend 5 more minutes per hard problem than the American students. All they did was just spend more time on the problem. They just didn't give up. For me, I'm not smarter, I just stuck around.
