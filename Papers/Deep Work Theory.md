# Deep Work Theory

Deep Work is a concept coined by computer science professor and author Cal Newport, which refers to the ability to focus intensely and without distraction on cognitively demanding tasks. Newport argues that in today's age of constant distractions and interruptions, the ability to engage in deep work has become increasingly rare, but it is a skill that is essential for achieving high levels of productivity, creativity, and professional success.

The Deep Work theory suggests that the ability to perform deep work requires two main skills: the ability to **concentrate intensely on a single task for an extended period of time**, and the ability to **push one's cognitive abilities to their limits** in pursuit of a challenging goal. To develop these skills, Newport suggests a number of strategies, such as:

1.  **Minimizing distractions**: Eliminating or minimizing distractions such as social media, email, and other notifications that can interrupt deep work sessions.
    
2.  **Scheduling Deep Work sessions**: Designing a schedule that allows for regular and consistent periods of deep work, and avoiding multitasking as much as possible.
    
3.  **Setting clear goals**: Identifying clear and specific goals for each deep work session, and focusing on tasks that require the most concentration and cognitive effort.
    
4.  **Building a ritual**: Establishing a routine or ritual that helps signal to the brain that it's time to focus on deep work, such as setting aside a dedicated workspace or listening to a specific type of music.
    

Overall, the Deep Work theory emphasizes the importance of cultivating deep work habits and minimizing distractions in order to achieve a high level of productivity, creativity, and professional success.

## Jordan Peterson

I recall a YouTube short where Jordan Peterson talking about a rule in his house, that he would work for 3 hours without anyone allowed to come into his room, because each idea build on a myriad of other ideas, and when a distraction is introduced in the process of ideation, the edifice of idea which your highest idea depends on comes crashing down. It is like building a tower, and just as you are reaching the final block, somebody opens the door and knocks it down. Therefore it was imperative for him to have an extended amount of time for undistracted work.

# Flow State Theory

**Flow State Theory** suggests that individuals are most productive when they are in a state of complete immersion in their work and fully engaged in what they are doing. Interruptions and distractions can disrupt this state and make it difficult to maintain focus and productivity.

What is a theory or a model of thinking that describes how a worker can be more efficient with less interruptions? For example, I'm a programmer, and it takes time to accumulate my thoughts, and if I'm interrupted every 20 minutes, I never get a long enough train of thought to problem-solve effectively. The momentum I get from working get's wasted every time somebody asks me for help with something. So my productivity diminishes. I need the inertia to keep going to be productive.

The most time I had to work on my User Story this week was 20 minutes of uninterrupted work. I know other people deal with this too. I think we need a better process to protect developers from interruptions. ().

To maintain a state of flow, it is important to minimize interruptions and distractions as much as possible. This might mean setting aside specific times for answering emails or taking phone calls, or using noise-cancelling headphones to block out distracting sounds.

Another strategy is to break your work into smaller, manageable tasks and focus on completing one task at a time. This can help you stay on track and maintain your momentum, even if you do get interrupted.

Finally, it is important to take breaks regularly to recharge and refocus. Research suggests that taking short breaks every 90 minutes can help maintain productivity and prevent burnout. During these breaks, you might consider doing something relaxing, such as taking a walk or doing some light stretching, to help clear your mind and recharge your energy.

# Strategies

There are a few ideas I have to help maximize Deep Learning Sessions:

1. **Block time on your calendar**.
	
2. **Set Team's status to "Focusing"**.
	
3. **Working Agreements**: Create a working agreement with the team, PO, and manager to allow for 90 minute segments of uninterrupted work, so that there is not an expectation to reply to anyone within those 90 minutes.
	
4. **Balance the work load**: Create a Ticketing Ticket Counter (TTC) slack bot to channel bugs, questions, and all external requests, which can be delegated to members on the team so that one person is not overwhelmed.
	
5. **Create transparency**: If we don't have the bandwidth to assist another team with something, tell them we will add it to our backlog. Ask them to submit a ticket. We need to get away from this constant multitasking that we do.
