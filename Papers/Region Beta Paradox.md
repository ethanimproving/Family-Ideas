[Region Beta Paradox | Chris Williamson & Joe Rogan](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/d5c_EZfxJgw)

Imagine if you were to go a mile you'd walk it, but if you were to go more than a mile you'd drive it. Paradoxically you would go 2 miles quicker than you would go 1 mile. So that means that sometimes worse situations can be better than better situations. So for instance, the friend that should leave his job, but it's just passable, his boss isn't that much of a dick, maybe the benefits are okay, whatever, or that person that's in a relationship with someone that they really don't want to stay with, but it's not that bad. ==All of these people would be better off if their situations were worse because it would galvanize them into actually doing something==. You can get stuck in this chasm of comfortable complacency that sits somewhere in the middle. If things are good, great.  If things are bad, great. Activation energy to go and make them good. If things are just about passable, you end up being comfortably numb. 

> [!Bible] [Revelation 3:15-18 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Revelation+3:15-18?translation=kjv)
> 15. I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.
> 16. So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.
> 17. Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:
> 18. I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that  the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.

Their wealth is keeping them content enough to believe they don't need anything better. Because their life is good enough, they aren't seeking the ultimate treasure of Christ.
