[Neil deGrasse Tyson 'rebukes' Richard Dawkins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRitr8RYsh4)
You're a professor of the public understanding of science, not just a professor of delivering truth to the public. These are two different exercises. One of them is putting the truth out there, and, like you said, they either buy your book or they don't. Well, that's not being an educator. That's just putting it out there. Being an educator is not only getting the truth right, but ==there has to be an act of persuasion as well==.

Persuasion isn't always saying, "Here are the facts, you're either an idiot or you're not." ==It's presenting the facts with sensitivity to your state of mind. It's the facts plus the sensitivity, convolved together, that creates impact==. And I worry that your methods and how articulately barbed you can be end up simply being ineffective, when you have much more power of influence than what is currently reflected in your output.
