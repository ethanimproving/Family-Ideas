# Ride Inspiration Until It Ends

I sat down next to my Pastor on a flight to Brownsville for a mission trip, and I asked him, “You prepare 4 sermons a week, drive 4 hours to Houston and back every Thursday to preach for Pure Words Baptist Church, dealing with a lawsuit for former members stealing all the church money, a lawsuit for the landlord evicted us, you work 20 hours a week freelance programming, and you have a family. How do you do it?” And he said to me, “I feel like I just do everything badly. Like I’m in a kitchen with six ovens just running to whatever is burning. One thing that really helps is I let inspiration write my sermons. I’ve found that sitting down to write a sermon is an inefficient use of time because I could sit down for 3 hours and not think of anything to say. But when I’m driving to Houston, and a random thought from my Bible reading lands on me, I’ll take a quick voice note. When you’re in the shower you get shower thoughts, and most people waste those moments of inspiration. The only way I can feasibly write sermons on my schedule is to ride that inspiration until it’s over. I drop whatever I’m doing and write notes. Then before I preach, I assemble all the notes into a coherent message. And I have to multitask. So if I know I need to make a phone call, I’ll do it while driving. And I will have my phone out in the car with the Bible app open to do Bible memory while driving.”

The same idea of riding inspiration until it ends applies to many areas of life, including programming. If it’s 10 o’clock at night, and you’re mocking a test doing TDD, and there’s nobody pinging you on Teams, nobody asking for help, that is your time to focus. You’re making strides. You’re getting the work done. And as a consequence you come into work a little bit late. Any company should want you to do that, and work when you’re most productive as opposed to when you’re least productive. 

This is how I accomplish so much in a day. And if I have to be [[Gain Discipline|disciplined]] for the sake of being on time consistently, the trade off is less productivity and less efficiency, and the bottom line suffers. Then I also feel disrespected, I don’t enjoy freedom or feeling that my boss trusts me, and I haven’t been given a reason that 10 o’clock is more beneficial. I want to spearhead a forward thinking movement that allows people to take ownership in their product by answering the question of what am I delivering rather than what time am I showing up. Working from home should be standardized. 

# I Am Delivering A Product, Not Trading My Time - Protocol Serves That Goal

Nobody should view their job as “What can I do to get paid,” but, “What need is there in the world, and how do I fulfill it?” Somebody makes a shoe, somebody makes a hat, and we trade. You’re producing value for your company. You aren’t trading your time for money, you’re trading a service for money. And that’s what a lot of people miss when we get caught up in the politics and protocols that are in place. Those protocols exist to contribute to the bottom line. Just as when Jesus said, “The Sabbath is for man, not man for the Sabbath.” What’s he getting at? A day of rest is there for YOU. It was never meant to be something that worsens the lives of people and prevents us from doing good. So in cases when Jesus sees a need to help someone, the Sabbath rules are always under the umbrella of reason. The ideal work culture is where protocols are too.

If you know a particular person is trustworthy, and they aren’t taking advantage of the freedom you give them for laziness, protocol is the worse thing for your company, because it will dampen his moments of inspiration. Let him come in at 10. Let him work when he’s productive. The freedom that you give him will pay off.

This is what it means to be a forward thinking company. 

# Work When You Are Most Productive

I was at a family Thanksgiving and met a CEO from China, who said developers are more productive at the end of the day, so he allows them to work when it’s convenient for them, and he’s been more productive after that decision.

I don’t mind at all if the rule is, “Any time you work late you have to ping the manager with what you worked on.” No problem. I would only dislike that if I wasn’t working. But as someone who does a lot, I actually want my hard work to be recognized, so I think that’s a good checks and balance. Freedom doesn’t come for free. Blind trust isn’t good, but trust that is built in the foundation of results is enormously valuable. 

It’s also important to have time where you can work undistracted, and that’s where our core hours come in, that we are all here from 10 to 4. We have plenty of time together, and also some time alone

# We Are All Individuals With Difference Situations

She mentioned to me, "10 o'clock is a bad working agreement. Edge is the only squad that comes in at 10. Everyone else comes in at 9," and I said, "And that's a beautiful thing! Because we're all individuals, with different lives, different commutes, different schedules, and it's a big win to have a work culture that understands that everyone has different lives, and the diversity that comes with that."

Part of celebrating DEI is recognizing that everybody has a different life and a different situation, different commutes, different schedules, different health problems, different family situations. That’s what DEI is all about: we’re all individuals.

At the end of the day we’re all working together to create the best work environment we can make, and we need to realize that working is an agreement between the employee and the employer, a good for a service, that I’m providing something to you. 

## Celebrate Diversity Of Personalities

I need 8 hours of sleep to function properly. I spent 1 year doing 7 hours of sleep and it messed me up. My doctor said that some people can live with 6 hours, some 7, but I need 8. So no matter when I go to bed, I shift things to get 8 hours of sleep. Otherwise I will lose sleep as a routine if I don’t prioritize it. And that is not healthy. And I don’t think work should get in the way of that. 

My strengths finder is activator. I’m good at getting started. So we should have diversity of personalities. That’s why we’re taking [Emergenetics](https://emergenetics.com/). It doesn’t make sense to create 1 policy for every personality type. I’m not on my bed scrolling TikTok. I’m redeeming the time because the days are evil. And that’s my personality. We should have flexible policies that make provisions for differences in personality. ==Ethan comes in late because he rides inspiration and always delivers results at the end of the day==. What’s your excuse?

## True Equity Must Account For Differences In Personality

We have core hours that you know you can depend on me to answer, you can reach me, and we can work together. But I should have a minimum of 2 hours that’s my time, where I can focus. If that’s not working for someone else, create an understanding with that person, not with everyone. You don’t spank all the kids because one misbehaved. That’s not truly equity, just as we learned in one of our DEI courses. ==If you have a 6 foot tall person and a 5 foot tall person, giving them the same size footstool isn’t equity==. To have equity we need to account for the differences in each individual’s personality, and tailor policies that way. A doctor wouldn’t prescribe the same treatment for every patient. There is a belief that having the same policy for everyone is equity, but that is like giving the same footstool to every person regardless of their height. To be a forward thinking company, we have to recognize that everybody is different, with different lives, different personalities, different schedules, and different ways of being productive. Let us become the best versions of ourselves by making our personalities work for us and I promise you won’t regret it. 

Command and control is a bygone era. We’re in an era of trust. 

My commitment is to come in at 10, plus or minus 15 minutes, subject to the time I went to bed. My bed time is 10pm subject to when inspiration strikes.
