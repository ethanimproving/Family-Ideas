Surely you and your viewers have heard of the Overview Effect, which is described by astronauts who have gone into orbit. ==They look down on Earth and national borders dissolve away. They see the fragility of where they came from. It's a whole other outlook, and astronauts are typically changed for having gone into space and looked down on Earth==. That has great value, but you know what has even greater value? A perspective that goes even beyond that. I would call it a cosmic perspective, which exists not only in sight lines back towards Earth. So, if you go to the Moon, for example, and you look back to Earth, it's no longer just land masses passing beneath your feet. No, it's the entire Earth, and you say, "Wait a minute, that's a planet, and I'm not on that planet right now. It's just floating. What's holding it up? I don't know. It's just there, and it's orbiting that star." You don't, like I said, see the color-coded countries in the schoolroom globe. You see oceans, land, and clouds. That's it. You don't know that people are killing one another because of what gods they worship or don't worship, or what skin color they have, or who they sleep with. You don't see any of that.

So, is it a good thing that you see it from far away, that you don't notice it, or is that a bad thing? You could probably argue it both ways, but I would say on balance it's a good thing because if I go up into space and go to the Moon with someone from a different faction, let's call them, where our factions are fighting each other on Earth, and we're together up on the Moon where our survival depends on each other, do you think we're gonna listen to instructions from military commanders on Earth or from heads of parliament? Should I punch him in the nose now or later? What should I do? No. We are two human beings, Homo sapiens, a quarter million miles away from the next nearest Homo sapien. This is a cosmic perspective. Things look different from that distance.

# How To Get People To Join Your Cult?

[Neil deGrasse Tyson Is Not Afraid of Artificial Intelligence](https://youtu.be/ukhmq5on-IA?t=778)

Just ask any priest-- ask any cult leader. How do they get you to join the cult? 'The end of the world is coming, ==you have to join my cult because I know how to get around that==.' Okay, what do you think the people in Jonestown were saying? How many people died? I forgot the number. A cult in, was it British Guyana where the end of the world is coming? "Let's all commit suicide so we will go to where we need." The Heaven's Gate cult, all of this.
