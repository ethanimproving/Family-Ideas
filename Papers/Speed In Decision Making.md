# Order Food Quickly

[Order your food quickly](https://www.tiktok.com/@businesssapience/video/7309626845010365739)

Show me how long it takes you to order at a counter and I will show you your bank account. I was at a counter at a coffee shop, and there's always a lady in front of you. The lady in front of you takes four centuries to order a coffee and a muffin. What I quickly realize is that ==if you want to get something done, you give it to a busy person==. That's why they say you should take somebody to dinner before you hire them or take them out to lunch. See how quickly they make decisions. **People who take forever to order when they stand in line are** (1) really comfortable inconveniencing somebody else around them, which means they have limited self-awareness, maybe borderline narcissism. Simultaneously (2) **they're not very efficient at the things that don't really matter**. That coffee order does not *really* matter. So, if we know we are here for a finite amount of time, why spend so much time on that, as opposed to a walk, a sunset, etc.?

# Make Quick Decisions

I broke up when my ex-boyfriend, who wanted to marry me, because there was a power struggle in our relationship. I wanted him to dominate me because I didn't want to be the leader, but I ended up being the leader. I didn't feel safe with him. If he made me feel safe, I would have naturally submitted, and we would have been amazing. 

He couldn't make fast decisions, and I can make faster decisions. I mean, everything we did, ==he was going to get his real estate license. He couldn't even pick the date for the test==. Like, I'm sorry, I have two real estate licenses. I can pick dates for tests.

# Answer Phone Calls Fast

I heard a YouTube short either from Patrick Bet-David or Justin Waller where he told a story of someone who reached out to them about a collaboration, and when he responded, the person texted back in minutes. This gave him a positive impression because he thought, "Ah, somebody who works like I do. With speed."
