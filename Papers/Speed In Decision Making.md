# Order Food Quickly

[Order your food quickly](https://www.tiktok.com/@businesssapience/video/7309626845010365739)

Show me how long it takes you to order at a counter and I will show you your bank account. I was at a counter at a coffee shop, and there's always a lady in front of you. The lady in front of you takes four centuries to order a coffee and a muffin. What I quickly realize is that ==if you want to get something done, you give it to a busy person==. That's why they say you should take somebody to dinner before you hire them or take them out to lunch. See how quickly they make decisions. **People who take forever to order when they stand in line are** (1) really comfortable inconveniencing somebody else around them, which means they have limited self-awareness, maybe borderline narcissism. Simultaneously (2) **they're not very efficient at the things that don't really matter**. That coffee order does not *really* matter. So, if we know we are here for a finite amount of time, why spend so much time on that, as opposed to a walk, a sunset, etc.?

# Make Quick Decisions

I broke up when my ex-boyfriend, who wanted to marry me, because there was a power struggle in our relationship. I wanted him to dominate me because I didn't want to be the leader, but I ended up being the leader. I didn't feel safe with him. If he made me feel safe, I would have naturally submitted, and we would have been amazing. 

He couldn't make fast decisions, and I can make faster decisions. I mean, everything we did, ==he was going to get his real estate license. He couldn't even pick the date for the test==. Like, I'm sorry, I have two real estate licenses. I can pick dates for tests.

# Answer Phone Calls Fast

I heard a YouTube short either from Patrick Bet-David or Justin Waller where he told a story of someone who reached out to them about a collaboration, and when he responded, the person texted back in minutes. This gave him a positive impression because he thought, "Ah, somebody who works like I do. With speed."

# Leader's Don't Terry Long

[Sheba the Son of Bichri](https://rumble.com/v26zcg8-sheba-the-son-of-bichri-2019-january-9-steven-anderson.html?start=2305)

When you're a leader, you've got to be decisive, you've got to act, you've got to show strength, and you can't delay. People who are doubtful and doubleminded, and they delay, and they're indecisive-- they're bad leaders. A good leader makes decisions, gets things done, and he doesn't just wait for the sake of waiting when there's no reason to wait. This guy is delaying, and that's a negative thing to delay.

> [!bible] [James 4:17 - KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+4:17&version=kjv)
> 17. Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.

If you know the right thing to do, do it today. You don't need to wait until tomorrow. Don't put off to tomorrow what you can do today.
