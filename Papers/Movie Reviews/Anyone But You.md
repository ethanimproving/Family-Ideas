# Intro

[Anyone But You](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt26047818/) is a movie that begins with two people meeting at a coffee shop and they immediately hit it off. They went out together and fell asleep talking because they were so good for each other. When the girl wakes up the next morning, she left and called her friend about the amazing time. Then her friend asks why she didn't stay until he woke up, and she returns hoping to have something with him. Just then, the guy was talking with his friend, and to avoid embarrassment acted like he didn't like this girl that ran away from him. "That girl was a disaster," he said. "I couldn't get rid of her fast enough." She overheard him say that, and understandably became angry with him and hurt.

# Homosexuality

Later on it turns out the guy's friend's sister is going to marry the girl's sister. This is the first violation of the Miller Code [[Title 3 - Media|Title 3 Article 1 Section 1]], promoting sodomy in the film. One of the biggest problems in the world right now is the rise of homosexuality, and it is my creed never to support a film that contributes to that agenda in any small part. I don't want to empower Hollywood to ruin the world for the next generation. My job is to fight against it, not to empower it.

# Nudity

Only a few scenes later the guy is on a beach and sees his ex, a topless Australian girl laying face down who stands up exposing her breasts for the world to see. Children will see this film. Husbands will see this film. Burning single men will see this film. This is the second violation of Title 3. Anything with nudity is to be shunned because it causes heart-level infidelity when men take pleasure in looking at naked women. Violence on the screen is fake. Nobody dies. Nudity is not fake. That woman is really naked, prostituting her sexuality for money from the producers.

# Casual Sex Ideology 

The third strike came softly throughout the film. The friends began trying to set the two up together, and make comments such as, "I'm not talking about love. I'm talking about dick." This promotes the worldly ideology that sex is casual recreation to be enjoyed by any willing participants. It stands it stark contract with the Biblical conviction to honor the marriage bed, to flee fornication, and to be pure in heart. This single movie violates all 3 standards in the Miller Code regarding movie restrictions. Mariana and I walked out of the theatre by her choice.

There is no place for this movie among those of the Miller Household. Neither Christians.
