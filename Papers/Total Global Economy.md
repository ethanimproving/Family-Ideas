# Total GDP

As of 2021, the estimated nominal gross domestic product (GDP) of the entire world is around ==$88 trillion USD==. However, this figure can vary depending on the data source and measurement method used. It's important to note that GDP is a measure of the total value of goods and services produced by a country or region within a specific period, usually a year.

# How Much GDP Per Household

To estimate how much each household would have if the global GDP were evenly distributed, we would need to make several assumptions, including what we define as a "household" and what period we use to distribute the GDP.

Assuming a household consists of an average of 4 people and we distribute the GDP over a year, we can calculate an estimate by dividing the global GDP by the global population and then multiplying it by the number of people in a household:

$$$88 trillion / 7.9 billion people = $11,139 / person / year$$

$$$11,139 x 4 people = $44,556 / household / year$$

Again, this is a rough estimate, and it's important to note that income distribution is never perfectly equal in reality. In addition, the cost of living can vary greatly between countries, so the value of this income would differ depending on where you are in the world.

# Current Distribution of Wealth

According to recent data, ==the top 1% of global earners own approximately 45% of the world's wealth==. However, it is important to note that wealth distribution can vary greatly depending on the country and region in question. In some countries, such as the United States, the top 1% may own a significantly larger portion of the wealth, while in others, such as certain Scandinavian countries, wealth may be distributed more equally among the population.

The distribution of global GDP can be visualized as a skewed bell curve, with a small percentage of individuals or groups owning a significant portion of the total GDP, and the majority of individuals or groups owning a smaller portion.

This is just for the US:

The top 1% of earners own approximately 45% of the world's wealth, while ==the bottom 50% of earners own only 1%== of the world's wealth. This distribution is not evenly spread out among the percentiles, as the majority of the wealth is concentrated in the top percentiles.

If the bottom 50% of earners own only 1% of the total GDP, and the global GDP is approximately 88 trillion USD, then the total share of the bottom 50% of earners in the global GDP would be:

$$1\% of 88 trillion USD = 0.01 x 88 trillion USD = 880 billion USD$$

To calculate how much each person in the bottom 50% of earners would own, we need to know the total population of the bottom 50% of earners. Unfortunately, this information is not readily available, and the population of the bottom 50% of earners can vary greatly depending on the country and region in question. Therefore, it is difficult to provide an accurate estimate of how much each person in the bottom 50% of earners would own based solely on this information.

$$880 billion USD / 4 billion people = $220 USD / person / year$$
50% of the world live on less than $1 a day.[^1] It is important to note that this distribution can vary greatly depending on the country and region in question. In some countries, such as certain Scandinavian countries, wealth may be distributed more equally among the population, resulting in a more even distribution of GDP across percentiles.

# Effects Of Technology On GDP Growth

The advancement of technology in recent years has been nothing short of remarkable. It has revolutionized the way we live, work, and communicate, and has had an immense impact on the global economy. Technological advancements have allowed us to produce goods and services more efficiently and effectively than ever before, resulting in measurable increases in global GDP.

## Tractors
One of the most significant technological advancements that caused a measurable increase in global GDP was the invention of the tractor. Before tractors, farmers relied on animal power to cultivate their land, which limited their productivity. With the introduction of tractors, farmers were able to increase their productivity dramatically, with one farmer able to ==produce enough food for 10 families each year before the tractor, and now enough for 100 families per year==.

## Roads

Another significant technological advancement was the development of roads. The construction of roads made transportation of goods and people more efficient, which led to increased trade and economic growth. The creation of the interstate highway system in the United States, for example, is estimated to have ==added $6 trillion to the U.S. economy== since its inception in 1956.

## Computers

Computers have also played a crucial role in advancing the global economy. Computers have increased productivity and efficiency in almost every industry, from manufacturing to finance. In 2020, the global market for computer hardware was valued at $489.5 billion USD, contributing significantly to global GDP.

## Industrial Revolution

The industrial revolution, which saw the introduction of factories and mass production techniques, also had a significant impact on the global economy. With the introduction of factories, goods could be produced faster, cheaper, and in larger quantities, leading to increased trade and economic growth.

## AI and Robotics

As we move forward, there are many exciting technological advancements on the horizon that have the potential to revolutionize the global economy even further. The development of artificial intelligence, robotics, and renewable energy sources are just a few examples.

## Education and Training

However, there are steps that need to be taken to ensure that there is enough GDP in the world for every person to have abundance. One of the key steps is investing in education and training programs that will allow people to ==acquire the skills needed to work in industries that are in high demand==. Additionally, governments and organizations must invest in research and development to continue to innovate and create new technologies that will drive economic growth.

In conclusion, technological advancements have had a measurable impact on the global economy, with significant increases in GDP attributed to inventions such as the tractor, roads, computers, and factories. As we look to the future, it is essential that we continue to invest in education and research and development to ensure that we can continue to grow the global economy and provide abundance for all.
