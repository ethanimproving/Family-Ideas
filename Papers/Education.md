The best learning you will ever do is self taught. Your mind may wander in a lecture, but your own interests will have all of your attention. Information that is useful is 100 times easier for your brain to remember, based on Information Processing Theory. The more context you have for a fact, and the more connections to other pieces of information, the easier it is to recall.

# Online Education Platforms

When I was in college, I remember sitting at my desk for a 40 minute lecture as my professor that didn't speak great English wrote things on the bored, asked questions that nobody responded to, and painfully tried explaining concepts of government that nobody understood.

Then I went online to Education Portal and watched a 6 minute video explaining the same thing, and it made perfect sense. It was concise and articulated clearly. Instead of drawings on the whiteboard, there were instant animations with colors and detail that are impossible in a classroom setting. The beautiful thing is that this video can scale to reach an unlimited number of people, whereas a professor's lecture has to be delivered year-after-year until he's too old to deliver it anymore. This allows the platform to find the top 1 percentile of most effective educators and pay them well to sit down and figure out the best possible way to teach a topic in the most concise video possible. Then you add animations, sound effects, voice overs if applicable, and a 6 minute video becomes far more effective than a 40 minute lecture surrounded by your classmates. The day I found that platform was the day a flame ignited in my heart that scalable online teaching resources was more effected than the outdated college system we've had for 400 years.

Today we have the internet, ChatGPT, Personal Knowledge Management Systems, and the **entire collective knowledge of humanity at our fingertips**. 

The college system is broken. Teachers are penalized if a large percentage of the class fail because in theory it indicates that the teacher is ineffective. This policy however only incentivizes the teachers to dumb down the material to allow more students to achieve a higher grade artificially. Budgets are taken away if they are not used, so professors will throw pizza parties just to hang onto the budget, wasting money with unnecessary spending.

There's way too many teachers and professors. Today people are naturally incentivized to make videos of well articulated educational topics just to get views for ad revenue. If someone is bad at it, they get fewer views, causing people to want to know how to present information in a more appealing way. This becomes like a first language, wherein a child naturally knows how to speak before knowing the grammatical rules. I submit in the same way, we naturally know how to present information so that people are entertained without knowing theories of teaching methods. We watch videos that are successful and imitate them. And so the world has a surplus of information

It is better to seek out information out of curiosity than to be given information to prove yourself on a test. I think the testing system is the worst part of education. **A grade is not the goal. A rich mind is the goal**. I will always teach my kids that. I will make sure they know I do not care 5% as much what grades they have as what conversations we can have at the dinner table. Except for math. But if you can solve a problem with a calculator, I don't care if you can solve it on paper. You will always have a calculator more readily available for you on your phone than a piece of paper in this day and age.

# Social Aspect

Kids shouldn't depend on school for their social lives. What happens in many cases is that people get out of school and never make friends after that. There should be other establishments in place for people's social lives. Church, hobby groups, boy scouts, normalizing meeting people at the park. The problem with school friendships is that **they’re only friends with you as long as they’re with you in the place that you’re forced to be**. You can find [[Charisma Matrix|online social training]] and have a flourishing social life without depending on school for that, and I would argue it's better to do it that way, because then your social life doesn't die when you graduate.

# College Sparks Creative Thought

On the other hand, I kept a document called "Doctrines To Ponder," and I recall the best quality thoughts I ever had was when I was in college, not when I was homeschooled. There may be something about college that is conducive to a higher level of thought. My mind seemed more clear, more organized back then. I wasn't interested in all the courses I took, but as I took them, I became interested. That is a positive thing. I would have less interests if I didn't go to college. For that reason, I will be open to the idea of sending my kids to public school to stimulate their minds. If I find that it becomes a hindrance to their natural curiosity, and that they learn more effectively with online resources, I will pivot as the circumstances call for.

I was not educated well as a child. I cheated, and I didn't learn geography. I know less facts than the average person, but I am more effective at solving problems than the average person too. I have higher quality thoughts.
