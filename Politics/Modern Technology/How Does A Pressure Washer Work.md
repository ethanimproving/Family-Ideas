The operation of a pressure washer is primarily based on fundamental principles of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics. Here are the key scientific principles responsible for creating pressure in a pressure washer:

1. **Pascal's Principle**: This principle states that a change in pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid. In the case of a pressure washer, a pump applies pressure to the fluid (water), and this pressure is transmitted through the water, allowing it to exit the nozzle with high pressure.
    
2. **Bernoulli's Principle**: Bernoulli's principle relates the pressure, velocity, and height of a fluid in a closed system. When the velocity of a fluid increases, its pressure decreases, and vice versa. In a pressure washer, the pump increases the velocity of the water, which reduces its pressure. However, this is compensated for by the pump, which continuously pressurizes the water to maintain the desired high pressure at the nozzle.
    
3. **Hydrodynamics**: The principles of fluid dynamics govern the flow of water through the pressure washer's system. The pump and nozzle are designed to optimize the flow of water, ensuring that it reaches high pressures while maintaining a steady and controllable stream.
    
4. **Thermodynamics**: The power source of the pressure washer (either a gas engine or electric motor) operates based on thermodynamic principles. These power sources convert energy into mechanical work to drive the pump, which pressurizes the water.
    
5. **Nozzle Design**: The shape and size of the nozzle play a crucial role in creating and controlling the high-pressure spray. The nozzle accelerates the water, further increasing its velocity and reducing its pressure, which results in a high-velocity, high-pressure stream.
    

Overall, the scientific principles of fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, and the laws governing pressure transmission through fluids are central to the technology that enables pressure washers to create and deliver pressurized water for cleaning and various other applications.

The *flywheel* rotates the *crank shaft*, which moves the *piston* up and down within the cylinder. The flywheel has magnets built into it, and as it rotates past the *ignition coil* a magnetic field is created that sends voltage to the spark plug.
