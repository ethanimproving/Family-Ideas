A solar company called [Freedom Forever](https://freedomforever.com/) just visited my door to talk about a new program incentivized by the Texas government. They are offering to put their solar panel on my roof for 25 years (insured by them because they own the panels). They will sell me energy at 12.5 cents per kilowatt. Any excess energy I can sell to my energy provider at 14 cents per kilowatt. Because it’s their solar panel. The installation is free and I don’t pay for the panels. I only pay for the energy. I will pay $85 per month for around 8000 kW per year. I use around 6000 kW per year. So any extra that is generated from their solar panels I actually profit from by selling to my provider.

The price that I pay (12.5 cents / kilowatt) will increase by 2.4% per year. Because of some winter freezes in Texas recently, the government mandated the grids to be upgraded. This cost several billion dollars that ERCOT is going to recuperate from the consumers by [increasing rates roughly 30% per year](https://www.dallasnews.com/business/2024/02/27/oncor-boosts-infrastructure-spending-to-24-billion-as-texas-population-demand-grows/) for the next five years or so. I’m paying $.13 per kilowatt right now. I don’t know how much solar panels cost but my guess is the system is around $30,000. Please let me know if that estimate is way off. You probably have a lot more data on that than I do. What I’m wondering is how does the company make any money doing this. As the $85 a month that I’m paying over 25 years will only add up to around $30,000.which is the price of the panel that they’re putting on

1. There are a lot of complaints about Freedom Forever on the [Better Business Bureau (BBB)](https://www.bbb.org/us/ca/temecula/profile/solar-energy-contractors/freedom-forever-llc-1066-850031401), and a current alert for the company which is a big red flag. https://www.solarreviews.com/installers/freedom-solar-co-reviews
2. Because I'm not planning to stay here long term, I'm not interested in the cancellation fee if the next buyer doesn't agree to continue the PPA.
3. I can't find the government program online that supposedly is giving money to Freedom Forever.
4. After doing some more research I think if I end up going the solar route I will explore other options (choose buying a system outright rather than signing a PPA). Thanks for stopping by and educating me about the solar options out there, I wish much success to you and your company.
5. In the next 25 years US policy could easily change to a make nuclear energy prevalent, which would lower costs significantly while I'm stuck at a higher rate. 

# Questions
1. If there begins to be a lot of shade in Texas and the panels don't produce as much energy, do I still pay $85 per month or do I pay 12.5 cents per kw that it did produce?
2. If I begin using more than 8000 kw per year, does Freedom Forever add more panels? If I use less, do they take some away?
3. How does the company make more money?

# Business Model

1. **Installation Cost**: You estimated the system to be around $30,000. This can vary based on factors like the size of the system, type of panels used, and installation costs in your area.
    
2. **Monthly Payment**: You're paying $85 per month, which adds up to $30,600 over 25 years. This covers the cost of the panels, maintenance, and the service they're providing.
    
3. **Energy Sales**: Any excess energy you generate beyond your usage is sold back to your energy provider at $0.14 per kilowatt-hour, which can generate additional income for you.
    
4. **Annual Price Increase**: The company is increasing your price by 2.4% per year, which helps them account for inflation and potentially increase their profit margin over time.
    
5. **Government Mandate**: The recent government mandate to upgrade grids and increase rates might affect your calculations in the long term, potentially making solar energy a more attractive option compared to traditional grid energy.
    
6. **Profit for the Company**: The company likely makes its profit from a combination of factors, including the long-term contracts with consumers like yourself, the sale of excess energy to energy providers, potential tax incentives, economies of scale, and possibly other services they offer alongside solar panel installation.
    

Overall, while the upfront cost may seem high, the company likely aims to make a profit over the long term by providing a service that benefits both you and them, while also contributing to renewable energy goals.

## What Is A PPA?

A Solar Power Purchase Agreement (Solar PPA) is a financial arrangement in which a third-party developer owns, operates, and maintains a solar energy system on a customer's property, such as a residential or commercial building. The customer, often referred to as the host, agrees to purchase the electricity generated by the solar panels at a predetermined rate over a fixed period, typically ranging from 10 to 25 years.

Under a Solar PPA:

1. **No upfront cost**: The host typically does not pay for the installation of the solar panels or the equipment. The developer covers the upfront costs of design, permitting, installation, and maintenance.
    
2. **Electricity purchase**: The host agrees to purchase the electricity generated by the solar panels at a predetermined rate, which is often lower than the utility's retail electricity rates. This can lead to immediate savings on electricity bills for the host.
    
3. **Long-term agreement**: The Solar PPA typically involves a long-term agreement, commonly 10 to 25 years, during which the host purchases electricity from the solar system.
    
4. **Ownership**: The developer retains ownership of the solar panels and is responsible for their maintenance and operation throughout the duration of the agreement.
    

Solar PPAs are popular for homeowners and businesses looking to adopt solar energy without the high upfront costs of purchasing and installing solar panels outright. They provide a way to reduce electricity costs, lower carbon footprint, and support renewable energy without the financial burden of ownership and maintenance.

The average U.S. resident that enters into a solar lease or PPA will save between $5,000 and $6,000 on their electric bills over the life of their system. Those savings increase to around $25,000 if you go with a loan, and they sit around $31,513 if you buy your panels in cash.

## How much do you make?

To calculate the total payments over 25 years, we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series:
$$
S = a \left( \frac{{r^n - 1}}{{r - 1}} \right)
$$
Where:

- *S* is the sum of the series
- *a* is the first term of the series
- *r* is the common ratio
- *n* is the number of terms in the series
$$
S = $1000 \left( \frac{{1.024\%^{25} - 1}}{{1.024\% - 1}} \right) ≈ $29,782.43
$$
# Historical prices

According to [statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/200197/average-retail-price-of-electricity-in-the-us-by-sector-since-1998/) the average retail prices of electricity in the United States tend to rise by about

To calculate the percentage increase each year, you can use the formula for percentage change:
$$
\text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New value} - \text{Old value}}{\text{Old value}} \right) \times 100
$$

Electricity cost increased by approximately 93.31% from 1998 to 2023.
$$
\left( \frac{15.98−8.26}{8.26} \right) \times 100 ≈93.31\%
$$

$$
\text{Average annual increase} = \frac{93.31\%}{2023−1998} ≈3.7324\%
$$
So, on average, the electricity cost increased by approximately 3.7324% each year from 1998 to 2023.

# Are ‘Free Solar Panels’ a Scam?

- Lease agreements have hefty **cancellation fees**, sometimes as high as $20,000.
- If you ever decide to sell your home, **transferring a lease** to a new homeowner can be challenging. If the new owner doesn’t agree to assume the solar lease, you might have to pay to move the panels to a new residence, or worse, be forced to cancel your lease and pay the cancellation fee.
- In a worst-case scenario, hiring a low-quality solar panel installation company can lead to issues with your home or roof. Solar leases **may not offer workmanship warranties**, so you could face bills for any damage to the integrity of your home.

The average U.S. resident that enters into a solar lease or PPA will save between $5,000 and $6,000 on their electric bills over the life of their system. Those savings increase to around $25,000 if you go with a loan, and they sit around $31,513 if you buy your panels in cash.
