An average car emits 4.2 metric tons (~10,000 pounds) of carbon dioxide per year. An average tree absorbs 48 pounds. That means <mark class="hltr-yellow">it would take 208 trees to offset your one car</mark>. Thereâ€™s currently a little under 1.5 billion car registrations worldwide, which means at the very least <mark class="hltr-yellow">humanity should have planted an additional 312 billion trees to offset our carbon footprint</mark>. Instead, we have deforested almost all of Brazil to make room for grain production to feed cows so we can eat a hamburger.
