[Claudia Sheinbaum](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/04/24/who-is-claudia-sheinbaum-mexico-presidential-election/73437799007/), a scientist, engineer and former mayor of Mexico City who shares the populist ideology of her political mentor, current President Andrés Manuel López Obrador

Andrés Manuel López Obrador (often abbreviated as AMLO), the current President of Mexico, is associated with a form of populism characterized by several key elements:

1. **Anti-establishment Rhetoric**:
    
    - AMLO frequently positions himself against the political and economic elites, framing his administration as a government of the people against corrupt and self-serving elites. He emphasizes a commitment to fighting corruption and reducing the influence of entrenched interests in Mexican politics.
2. **Social Programs and Welfare**:
    
    - His populist agenda includes significant investment in social programs aimed at reducing poverty and inequality. AMLO has implemented and expanded various welfare initiatives, such as pensions for the elderly, scholarships for students, and financial aid for the poor.
3. **Nationalism and Sovereignty**:
    
    - López Obrador promotes a strong sense of national sovereignty, often taking stances that emphasize Mexico's independence in both economic and political matters. This includes a focus on reducing dependence on foreign powers and promoting domestic industries.
4. **Economic Policies**:
    
    - While AMLO supports social welfare programs, his economic policies are somewhat mixed. He advocates for fiscal austerity in government spending but also supports major infrastructure projects, like the Tren Maya and the Dos Bocas refinery, aimed at boosting the Mexican economy and creating jobs.
5. **Direct Engagement with the Public**:
    
    - A hallmark of AMLO's presidency is his direct communication with the public. He holds daily morning press conferences (known as "mañaneras") where he addresses national issues and interacts with the media and the public. This practice reinforces his image as a transparent and accessible leader.
6. **Centralization of Power**:
    
    - Critics argue that AMLO’s administration exhibits tendencies towards centralizing power. He has made moves to consolidate control over various aspects of government and public life, sometimes clashing with independent institutions and the judiciary.
7. **Rhetorical Style**:
    
    - AMLO’s rhetoric is often characterized by a moralistic tone, presenting his policies as a moral imperative to uplift the common people against the corrupt practices of the past. He frequently invokes historical figures and events to frame his policies as part of a broader historical struggle for justice and equality.
8. **Environmental and Indigenous Issues**:
    
    - Although his infrastructure projects have faced criticism from environmentalists and indigenous groups, AMLO has also promoted programs aimed at environmental conservation and support for indigenous communities. His approach balances development with these concerns, though not without controversy.

Overall, AMLO’s populism is a blend of ==leftist social policies==, nationalistic rhetoric, and a strong emphasis on anti-corruption and anti-elite narratives. His administration aims to create a more equitable society while maintaining a focus on Mexican sovereignty and national pride.
