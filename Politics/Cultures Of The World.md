I believe that each culture can contribute something positive to the way that we live. No culture is perfect, but we can learn a lot by extracting the positive things from each culture. Culture is really just a conglomeration of the lessons your ancestors learned, and passed down as traditions in your region. We stand to learn a lot by extracting the lessons that millions of people before us handed down to us. Which lessons are noble? Which are flawed? What is worth preserving and what is worth progressing?

This is similar to when I made a [[Ethan's Commitments#I Follow The Example of Great Men|list of people that I admire]] the most, and wrote down the qualities about them that I wanted to emulate in my own personal life.

# Intelligence By Language

## Sapir-Whorf hypothesis

There is a popular apologist by the name of William Lane Craig. He publishes his writings for free on www.reasonablefaith.org, which I used to read frequently. Several years ago I ready something he wrote that was making the argument that the language we speak influences the way that we think, because it is the vehicle by which we think. His argument was that there is no English word to describe something that there is a French word for. I don't remember what word it was, but I think it had something to do with time. Can you find the writing I'm looking for?

The idea that language can influence the way we think and perceive the world is known as linguistic relativity or the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. This hypothesis suggests that the structure and vocabulary of a language affect the ways in which its speakers conceptualize and think about the world.

For example, some languages have grammatical structures that require speakers to specify the direction in which an action is taking place (e.g. "He walked uphill" vs. "He walked downhill"). Speakers of such languages may have a greater awareness of spatial orientation and be more likely to pay attention to directional cues in their environment.

As for the specific example you mentioned, there are indeed some concepts that are expressed differently in different languages. For instance, the Hopi language of Native American culture does not have a past tense verb form, but rather uses different grammatical constructions to indicate whether an event occurred in the past or future. This has been cited as evidence for the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, suggesting that the structure of Hopi grammar influences the way its speakers think about time.

It's possible that William Lane Craig made a similar argument regarding a French word for a concept that lacks an equivalent in English, but without more specific information it's difficult to say for sure.

## How Is Intelligence Measured?

There is no scientific consensus on the definition of intelligence, how it should be measured, or whether it can be attributed to any particular linguistic or cultural factors. While some researchers have explored the relationship between language and cognitive development, the results of such studies are often mixed and difficult to interpret.

It's worth noting that intelligence is not determined by language, but rather by ==a combination of genetic and environmental factors, including access to education, nutrition, and social support==. Additionally, intelligence is a highly individual trait that can vary widely within any given linguistic or cultural group.
