[Every president in US history is related to one king](https://youtube.com/shorts/8epsI5-3HRo?feature=share)

> Did you guys know that every single president in U.S. history is related to one king? What I'm talking about is where it gets crazy. This man, **Harold Brooks Baker**, conducted a comprehensive study on U.S. presidents and their royal lineage. He had this theory that the presidents weren't voted in by the people, but they were actually selected based on royal bloodlines. So, about 13 years ago, this 12-year-old girl, with the help of her grandparents, embarked on a project for her seventh grade. They traced the lineage of each president and found that they all connected to one man. It's weird how ==all their lineages traced back to **King John** from the House of Plantagenet==. How is that possible? Moreover, there's a folklore surrounding the House of Plantagenet, suggesting that they were actually descendants from a demon. Oh, what? But that's where this guy comes in. He's like, it's not about who the people vote for; it's within the candidates that are running for president. It's about who has the more direct bloodline to King John.

You have two parents, 4 grand parents, 8 great grand parents, 16 great great grand parents. Lets pretend that you are English for the moment. For each 10 generations that you go back, the number of ancestors will be multiplied by 1000 ( well 1024 to be exact).

If you were to go back 20 generations (about 400–500 years) you’d have over a million ancestors. If you go back another 10 more generations, you would have sat 1 billion ancestors, that would be more than the entire population of England, which was about 2.5 million in 1200. So obviously most of your ancestors appear in multiple family lines. The likelihood is King John appears in there somewhere, but he’s just one of many of those living in 1200 who you come from.

Now suppose you are American, but you can trace your ancestry back to an English settler though say 20 generations. **He was most likely descended from King John, and so are you**.

Its not that startling when you think about it. If there were only 2.5 million people in England in 1200 and there’s 60 million today, you’ve probably got a family line back to many of the those in the population in 1200, King John being one of them. Doesn’t make you special I’m afraid.

Of course the model I’m describing doesn’t take into account people moving in and out of England since 1200, but we assume that this effect is fairly small in the overall scheme of things.

King John from the House of Plantagenet lived approximately 800 years ago. He reigned as the King of England from 1199 to 1216. Therefore, if we consider the current year to be 2023, it would be around 29 to 30 generations ago since King John's time.
