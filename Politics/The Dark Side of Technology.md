# Greed: Anti-progress

Along with the problem of, "How can I get paid?" There is another evil and sadistic driving motivator of work, which is, "How can I make as much money as possible?"

‚Äú the whole point of Tesla is to accelerate the advent of electric vehicles and sustainable transportation. We‚Äôve open sourced our patents. If somebody comes and makes a better electric car than Tesla, and it‚Äôs so much better that Tesla goes bankrupt, I still think that‚Äôs a good thing for the world.‚Äù ~ Elon Musk

This is how business should be.

# Chemically Engineered Viruses

[The Origins of Covid 19](https://youtu.be/FEh5JyZC218)
Evidence has come out that the Corona Virus was most likely engineered. Most viruses have very similar genomes, so they lined up the RNA sequence against 30 other viruses and found a spike gene that DOESN‚ÄôT EXIST in other viruses. üß¨ In particular this furin cleavage site is responsible for using a human enzyme called furin to reconfigure the virus as it leaves the cell to make it prime at attacking another cell. It‚Äôs specific to humans, and every other virus has a natural adaptation where a gene is changed slightly from one to another, but this one appears to be inserted because it‚Äôs completely new genetic information targeting very specific human enzymes.
