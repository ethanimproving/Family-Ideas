With the advent of AI technology and machine learning, more and more tasks can by managed by machines, freeing up humans to climb to new heights up Maslow's Hierarchy and do more meaningful work, addressing higher needs above base needs.

[Project 58](https://wolc.com/project-58/)

There was an inspiring video I watched from Project 58 a long time ago, posing the question, "What does the Bible say about the hungry?" And most common verse was, "The hungry will always be with you." But the presenter pointed out Jesus was talking to Judas, not to everyone. His mission: End world hunger. He tells the story of the evolution of technology, presenting statistics about how much better life is today because of each step of technological revolutions in our history. Look for that video in Biblical Videos on Plex. It used to be in my playlist [Mission Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQbzRmmMfk&list=PLYAz1Lwo4O59AZeLnib3vYTWfUZIx8d2m&index=1) but the account associated with that video has since been terminated. Luckily I downloaded it and just need to find it.

Similar to copyrights, or the year of Jubilee, every 50 years the machines that produce all the goods and services in the global economy should be distributed to society at large.

# Chocolate

I visited the Lindt Home of Chocolate Factory and Museum in Switzerland with my girlfriend Mariana, and it was amazing to see the evolution of how chocolate was created across 3 continents and 400 years. It used to be only in liquid form and only available for nobility to drink, because you had to dry the beans in the sun for days, crush them into grain yourself, and melt it over a fire. Someone created a machine to do all that in so much less time, that it made chocolate available cheaply to the entire world.

# AI-McDonalds: Fully Automated Fast Food

We've had free education for years. Both in public-school format as well as the Internet provided scalable information distribution service like Khan Academy, Study.com, and now ChatGPT, free of charge. Why are people worried about losing Fast Food jobs? If machines can automate the process, let them handle it to free us up to gain more advanced skills. There's so much to improve in the world. Use the Japanese Ikigai model to find a meaningful job, like building vertical farms, eco-cities, innovate something new. The more machines replace mundane human-tasks, the better.
