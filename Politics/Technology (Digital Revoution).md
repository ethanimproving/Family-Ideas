With the advent of AI technology and machine learning, more and more tasks can by managed by machines, freeing up humans to climb to new heights up Maslow's Hierarchy and do more meaningful work, addressing higher needs above base needs.

[Project 58](https://wolc.com/project-58/)

There was an inspiring video I watched from Project 58 a long time ago, posing the question, "What does the Bible say about the hungry?" And most common verse was, "The hungry will always be with you." But the presenter pointed out Jesus was talking to Judas, not to everyone. His mission: End world hunger. He tells the story of the evolution of technology, presenting statistics about how much better life is today because of each step of technological revolutions in our history. Look for that video in Biblical Videos on Plex. It used to be in my playlist [Mission Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQbzRmmMfk&list=PLYAz1Lwo4O59AZeLnib3vYTWfUZIx8d2m&index=1) but the account associated with that video has since been terminated. Luckily I downloaded it and just need to find it.

Similar to copyrights, or the year of Jubilee, every 50 years the machines that produce all the goods and services in the global economy should be distributed to society at large.

# Chocolate

I visited the Lindt Home of Chocolate Factory and Museum in Switzerland with my girlfriend Mariana, and it was amazing to see the evolution of how chocolate was created across 3 continents and 400 years. It used to be only in liquid form and only available for nobility to drink, because you had to dry the beans in the sun for days, crush them into grain yourself, and melt it over a fire. Someone created a machine to do all that in so much less time, that it made chocolate available cheaply to the entire world.

# AI-McDonalds: Fully Automated Fast Food

We've had free education for years. Both in public-school format as well as the Internet provided scalable information distribution service like Khan Academy, Study.com, and now ChatGPT, free of charge. Why are people worried about losing Fast Food jobs? If machines can automate the process, let them handle it to free us up to gain more advanced skills. There's so much to improve in the world. Use the Japanese Ikigai model to find a meaningful job, like building vertical farms, eco-cities, innovate something new. The more machines replace mundane human-tasks, the better.

The biggest problem in the world is that people think, "What can I do to get paid so that I can survive," rather than, "What problem exists in the world that I can help address to help fill in the gap?" Quantify your impact in the world. "I work for AutoZone." What service do you provide? How does that help people? Why do people pay for that service? Is that the most important thing that will maximize your potential while simultaneously making you happy? If not, do whatever else will maximize your human potential to make a big impact in the world. There are billions of people hungry, cities that look like slums, litter everywhere, crime everywhere, patchy roads everywhere. What can you do to fix the problem? Envision a utopian eco-city, and ask yourself, "How can I and the people around me actualize that utopia?" Get behind a mission statement and believe in it with all your heart.

The reason I stopped this effort is because I realized that the world is passing away, and I would rather spend my time pulling people out of hell than making the road to hell prettier. My utopian vision exists in a world farther out than I can see. I can only see it by faith in the Word of God. And if that world is what will be perfect, my mission is to get people into that world rather than bring that world here.

But if you can hear Jesus say, "Why kingdom come, why wil be done, on earth as it is in heaven," and use that as a mission statement to make the world a better place, than do it.

# Light

My uncle who is a missionary in PNG told me that when he first started his mission up there, they didn't have artificial light. So when it got dark, everybody used to go to sleep. But the single thing that changed the culture more than anything else was when they introduced flash lights into the village, because now they had the ability to go from place to place during the night.
