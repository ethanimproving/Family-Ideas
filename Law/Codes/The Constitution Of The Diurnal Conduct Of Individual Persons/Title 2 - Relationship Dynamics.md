# Article 4: Marital Fidelity

## § 2. Infidelity

**2.1** In accordance with Devine law, the transgression of infidelity would incur the consequence of physical death.

Dumb-speak: our relationship will end and the cheater can’t get any money out of it.

Devine sentence: Lev 20:10, De 22:22-24, 2Sa 12:13, Eze 23:45-47
