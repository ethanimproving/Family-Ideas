## § 1.  Doom Scrolling
- [ ] I want a better life for us. The danger of doom scrolling is that it eats away our life and diminishes our joy by distracting us from the truly fulfilling parts of our life.

The biggest danger of doom scrolling is not intrinsic, but extrinsic. How many times have I been intending to get something done with my evening, and I get stuck for 5 hours fool scrolling? It’s easy. You’re comfortable in your bed, you have turn your brain off, you don’t have to pay attention to anything for too long. But at the end of the day, many of those clips never matter. It was pure amusement, nothing educational or useful. This violates my life goal to be a fit, sharp minded person with age.

In 29 years time, these practices will make us dumber. I want us to have the self discipline to sit and read a book, and pay attention to one thing for vast amounts of time.
