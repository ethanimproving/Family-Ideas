# Article 1: Movies

## § 1.  Movie Restrictions

**1.1** Movies that include any of the following content are to be banned from watching:
1. Anything with nudity
2. Anything that promotes sodemy
3. Anything that is obviously promoting worldly thinking

**1.2** Before watching a movie, always check the rating.

**1.3** If a movie is rated R, always check [rottentomatos.com](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/) (or a comparable website). Navigate to the Movie Info section and check the details of the Rating. If nudity is included, the movie falls under the criteria of [[#Article 1 Movies|3 MHC A. 1: § 1.1]]

**1.4** Violence is permitted as a germane instrument of storytelling. The violence on the screen is acted, not real, and no viewer is watching real bloodshed.

> [!Bible] [Isaiah 33:15 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/isaiah+33:15?translation=kjv)
> 15. He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, ==that stoppeth his ears from *hearing of blood*, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil==;

- [[TV Hypocrisy]]

**1.5** A movie that promotes worldly thinking may be watched if the worldly ideology is identified and rebuked openly at the time that it is seen, or else after the movie finishes by reason of etiquette.

It is actually better in some cases to watch movies that promote bad ideologies because it [gives you an opportunity to confront them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUzLntb5T_U) publicly with your friends. It sometimes does more good to battle ideas than to boycott them.

## § 2.  Homosexual Actors and Characters

**2.1** It is permissible to watch shows with homosexual actors, given that they are playing the role of a normal heterosexual person.

Such as in the case of [White Collar](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1358522/), Neal Caffrey is played by [Matt Bomer](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0093589/?ref_=tt_ov_st), who is gay in real life. His character, however, is an intelligent heterosexual man who is a criminal consultant for the White Collar Crime Division of the FBI in New York City.

[Gomer Pyle](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057752/) is another TV show I find value in. It is relaxing and entertaining. We can learn from his character not to react with emotion and anger, and to take criticism in an optimal manner. Sometimes watching a character act out principles in the Bible is all we need to have a role model. Gomer Pyle responds to Sargent Carter's yelling and screaming with a smile, and thanks him for his criticism. This is a tangible way to act out Psalm 141.

> [!Bible] [Psalms 141:5 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/psalm+141:5?translation=kjv)
> 5. Let the righteous smite me;
it shall be a kindness: *and let him reprove me;
it shall be an excellent oil*,
which shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also
shall be in their calamities.

Homosexuals often make the best actors because they spend their whole life acting, pretending to be normal, when inwardly they are being filled with the attributes enumerated in [Romans 1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+1%3A18-32&version=KJV). This is why we call them gay to begin with. They pretend to be happy when [in reality they are miserable and suicidal](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/news/science-news/2021/researchers-find-disparities-in-suicide-risk-among-lesbian-gay-and-bisexual-adults). They are filled with hate. The fact that they have to pretend to be happy is evidence that society will not accept who they really are. The term "gay" is a reminder that they are still in the closet, hiding their true intentions every moment of their life.

**2.2** It is not proper to watch TV shows that include homosexual characters.

There is an agenda in Hollywood to promote the LGBT+ lifestyle in America. Homosexuality is up from [2% in Baby Boomers to 21% in Gen Z](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bojByDVrCeU), largely due to this initiative in movies and TV shows. It is not acceptable to tolerate this agenda in Hollywood. Despite the seeming futility of resistance, victory belongs to the Lord, and we need to send a message to Hollywood that we will not watch any content that promotes such an anti-God agenda.

Stedfast Baptist Church put out two documentaries exposing this agenda which are available below:
1. [The Sodomite Deception](https://sodomitedeception.com/)
2. [LGBT Terrorists](https://rumble.com/v33x0z1-lgbt-terrorists-documentary-stedfast-baptist-church.html)

## § 3.  Foolishness & Crude Humor

> [!Bible] [Proverbs 4:24 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/proverbs+4:24?translation=kjv)
> 24. Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee.

> [!Bible] [Ephesians 4:29 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/ephesians+4:29?translation=kjv)
> 29. Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.

> [!Bible] [Ephesians 5:3-4 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/ephesians+5:3-4?translation=kjv)
> 3. But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;
> 4. Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.

> [!Bible] [Psalms 101:3 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/psalm+101:3?translation=kjv)
> 3. I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.

# Article 2: Music

## § 1.  Lyrical Content

### §§ (a) Subliminal Influence

The phrases we listen to on repeat affect how we think. Hearing Charlie Puth talk about past relationships normalize sin in our minds. Inevitably we won't think fornication is such a big deal when all the music we listen to openly writes about it as a normal part of relationships in the lyrics.

- [i don't really like your boyfriend](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBbjcP57NEA&si=Pjhgh-kmbPF7Awie) by Avanue Beat encourages women to view boyfriends that don't want their girlfriends going to clubs as controlling and insecure.
- [Ice Cream](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=TUt3guu92Zg&si=hdI318VBjsehz2f9) by BLACKPINK & Selena Gomez subtly refers to herself as ice cream ready for a boy to double dip, giving boys the impression that girls want them to kiss them, lick their nipples, or have sex with them.
 • [Single Soon](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=cGIe4x1Xntg&si=JFwUrYNBQyfVHGyj) by Selina Gomez encourages girls that breaking up isn’t a big deal and you’ll be happy to be single. And don’t worry about how it will hurt your boyfriend.

I was listening to [89.7 PowerFM Christian Radio](https://www.radio.net/s/wayloud),  and a caller called in to share his testimony of a rough patch with his wife, as he was driving home one night after they were about to get a divorce, he heard the song [Ships In The Night](https://www.radio.net/s/wayloud) by Matt Kearney, and the song encouraged him to give it another try. Music has such a powerful affect on huge decisions that we make, and I wonder how many relationships have failed in large part because of the music that gave one party the wrong nudges.

Ending a relationship should be based on red flags in the person you are dating that violate the principles and standards you have decided for yourself that are non-negotiables in a partner. Or simply because you two have different goals and directions in life, and there's nothing wrong with that. It should not be because your boyfriend doesn't want you to go clubbing. You shouldn't go clubbing anyway, so your boyfriend is right, and you're listening to music encouraging you to dump him because of his upright principles. Any song that has such a message is written by deleterious agitators with a petty rebellion against authority in pursuit of a hedonistic lifestyle.

There's an anthem affect, where if something is said to a catchy tune, our minds give it more credit than we normally would. If they can trick us into singing the same lyrics, we ourselves are affirming to our subconscious mind that we believe them.

### Subsection 1(b)



## § 2.  Musical Content

### §§ (a) Brainwave Entrainment

### §§ (b) Subliminal Influence

# Article 3: Video Games

## § 1.  Dopamine

**1.1** There is single handedly no hobby or side thing you can do that will probably be more damaging to you being successful than playing video games. ~ [[Video Games|Alex Becker]]

## § 2. Waste Of Time

## § 3. Social Gaming

## § 4. Relaxation

# Article 4: Social Media

## § 1.  Doom Scrolling
- [ ] I want a better life for us. The danger of doom scrolling is that it eats away our life and diminishes our joy by distracting us from the truly fulfilling parts of our life.

The biggest danger of doom scrolling is not intrinsic, but extrinsic. How many times have I been intending to get something done with my evening, and I get stuck for 5 hours fool scrolling? It’s easy. You’re comfortable in your bed, you have turn your brain off, you don’t have to pay attention to anything for too long. But at the end of the day, many of those clips never matter. It was pure amusement, nothing educational or useful. This violates my life goal to be a fit, sharp minded person with age.

In 29 years time, these practices will make us dumber. I want us to have the self discipline to sit and read a book, and pay attention to one thing for vast amounts of time.

# Article 5: Piracy

## § 1.  Torrenting

**1.1** Using any form of online piracy is forbidden.

Companies who work hard to publish copyrighted goods deserve to be paid for the items they deliver to the public. God cares about his people doing justice in the marketplace.

> [!Bible] [Proverbs 16:11 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/proverbs+16:11?translation=kjv)
> 11. A just weight and balance are the LORD’S: ==all the weights of the bag
are his work==.

**1.2** Millers do not judge other kids for piracy.

Illegal piracy drives higher sales by increasing free publicity. When The Pirate Bay was shut down by the Federal Government in 2011, it was brought back online because sales from the video game industry and movies plummeted.

# Article 6: Pornography

## § 1.  Porn, Masturbation, and Orgasm (PMO)

**1.1** Millers do not look at porn or nudity to aid in masturbation and orgasm. Such practices damage the brain in a drug-like capacity, creating [[Video Games#Pornography Vs Cold Showers|free dopamine]].
