# Article 1: Fat Loss

## § 1. Principles

**1.1** I avoid [ultra-processed foods](https://youtu.be/ZemkG6Vj7hc?si=Fzr3XRGjcKEMbgSQ&t=3216).

**1.2** I avoid unnecessary added sugars.

**1.3** I eat enough Omega 3 fats.

Once you remove fat, food begins to taste pretty bad. We end up throwing a ton of sugar in there to make it taste good. That spikes our insulin, spikes our blood sugar, make our waistline get bigger, and here we are right in the middle of an obesity epidemic ([Doctor Mike](https://youtu.be/tkWpqaO0BnY?si=YP2HcCsZV05IpJwV&t=227)).

**1.4** I follow the [MyPlate guidelines](https://www.myplate.gov/).

Potatoes do not count towards your daily vegetable ([Doctor Mike](https://youtu.be/tkWpqaO0BnY?si=IWpQzi2zKgjRWml4&t=406)).

**1.5** If I see mold on one berry, I just throw that one out. The rest are still fine ([Doctor Mike](https://youtu.be/lUwUVVqJt1c?si=5pm8vLvudBDYC6Ju&t=48)).

**1.6** I get frozen fruits and vegetables.

A lot of people think frozen berries can lower their nutritional value but we haven't found that to be quite true ([Doctor Mike](https://youtu.be/lUwUVVqJt1c?si=JaHaONdOdV-u2uVm&t=59)).

## § 2. Weight Loss Pyramid

The first three aspects of the weight lost pyramid will account for 85-90% of your fat loss success.

![](https://i.imgur.com/bPRIktD.png)

### §§ (a) Calorie Deficit

**1.1** I have a negative calorie balance.

1. *Negative Calorie Balance*: Your burn MORE calories than you consume.
2. *Neutral Calorie Balance*: Your burn the SAME number of calories as you consume.
3. *Positive Calorie Balance*: Your burn FEWER calories than you consume.

No diet in the world will make you lose weight unless it also includes a calorie deficit. When applied to dieting, the first law of thermodynamics states that your body weight is dependent only on the difference between the amount of calories that you consume versus the amount of calories that you burn, which is known as your calorie balance.

Make sure to calculate your calorie balance based on your TDEE ([Felix Harder](https://americanairlines.udemy.com/course/weight-loss-masterclass-lose-fat-get-your-dream-body-now/learn/lecture/8283580#overview))

**1.2** I don't reduce my calories by more than 25% below maintenance.

Not only will too large of a calorie deficit make you feel more tired and hungry, it will also decrease hormone levels, sleep, quality and libido ([Felix Harder](https://americanairlines.udemy.com/course/weight-loss-masterclass-lose-fat-get-your-dream-body-now/learn/lecture/8283532#overview)).

**1.3** I calculate my Total Daily Energy Expenditure using a [TDEE calculator](https://www.freedieting.com/calorie-calculator).

It is calculated by estimating how many calories you burn while resting (called the basal metabolic rate or BMR) and adding a certain number of calories on top, depending on how often you exercise.

**1.4** I track my calories using [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/) and a [Kitchen Scale](https://www.amazon.com/Etekcity-Multifunction-Stainless-Batteries-Included/dp/B0113UZJE2/ref=zg_bs_g_678508011_sccl_2/134-3562437-0686944).

Use [WebMD's Calorie Tracker](https://www.webmd.com/diet/healthtool-food-calorie-counter) to check the values in your app.

### §§ (b) Macronutrients (Protein, Carbs, Dietary Fats)

**1.5** I adjust my diet to be high in protein. 

Daily intake: 
- 0.8 - 1 grams per pound of bodyweight (muscle growth)
- 0.4 - 0.5 grams per pound of bodyweight (normal health)

Good Protein Sources: 
- Eggs 
- Lean Meats 
- Chicken Breast 
- Beans & Legumes 
- Fish/Sea Food 
- Soy

Your macros along with your exercise regiment will determine how you lose weight (fat, muscle, or water loss).

If you exercise regularly, a high protein diet is even more important because this further increases your body's demand for amino acids. If it drops to low, strength and muscle loss is accelerated.

**1.6** I maintain strength during my dieting through [[Upper Lower Workout Routine|resistance training]]. 

**1.7** I consume a healthy amount of good carbohydrates.

Daily intake: 1 - 1.75 grams per pound of bodyweight

Carbs are not evil, they don't make you fat or unhealthy. In fact, there is a number of benefits to keeping carbohydrate intake as high as possible when dieting. They include:
1. Better workout performance
2. Improved retention of lean muscle mass
3. More satiety
4. Better energy levels.

Good Carb Sources: 
- Whole Grains (Oats, Rice, Quinoa, Whole Grain 
Pasta & Bread) 
- Beans & Legumes (not just high in protein but also 
quality carbs) 
- Fruits (as candy substitutes) 
- Potatoes 
- All Kinds Of Vegetables & Salads 


**1.8** I consume a healthy amount of dietary fats.

Daily intake: 15% - 35% of your daily calories

Dietary fat is essential for your body because it needs some fatty acids to survive and cannot produce them from other foods. You also need fat to regulate hormone production and to keep your skin and hair healthy. Fats also help you absorb vitamins a, d, e and k, the so-called fat soluble vitamins. And lastly, fat cells insulate your body and help you to keep warm.

Healthy Saturated Fats: 
- Butter 
- Grass Fed Beef 
- Eggs 
- Dairy Products 
- Coconut Butter

Healthy Unsaturated Fats: 
- Nuts & Seeds 
- Avocados 
- Fatty Fish 
- Olive Oil

### §§ (c) Food Composition

The quality of your food directly impacts your vitamin and mineral intake which can drastically improve your overall well being ([Felix Harder](https://americanairlines.udemy.com/course/weight-loss-masterclass-lose-fat-get-your-dream-body-now/learn/lecture/8283526#overview)).

When your goal isn't merely weight loss, but to have a lower body fat percentage with all the muscle you currently have, getting the majority of your calories from junk, carbs, and fats will no longer cut

**1.9** I choose fat loss foods to accommodate proper macronutrients.

The best foods for fat loss are those that provide lots of vitamins and minerals and are filling, while also being relatively light in calories, dietary fat, and added sugar in particular. When you focus on eating these types of foods, you're much less likely to struggle with hunger issues and to overeat ([Felix Harder](https://americanairlines.udemy.com/course/weight-loss-masterclass-lose-fat-get-your-dream-body-now/learn/lecture/8283534#overview)).

Lean types of meat for protein:
1. Chicken
2. Lean beef
3. Fish

Low fat dairy products:
1. Egg whites
2. Grains
3. Vegetables

Protein powder is a mixed bag because even though it's convenient it can leave you hungry if you have satiety issues.

**1.10** I avoid  foods that are are very calorie dense, high in dietary fat and added sugar, aren't all that filling, and are highly processed.

Junk food like:
1. Chips
2. Candy
3. Cookies
4. Other goodies and calorie beverages

### §§ (d) Meal Frequency & Meal Timing

### §§ (e) Supplements 

**1.11** I take 3-5 grams of [[Creatine|creatine]] every day.

**1.12** I take up to half of my daily protein intake with protein powder before or after my workouts.

Even though you don’t technically need it to build muscle, I don’t have time to cook high-protein meals all day. If you want to save yourself the stress (especially before and after a workout or when traveling) then go with a simple but quality whey protein like the one from [MyProtein](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008BH7KKM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B008BH7KKM&linkCode=as2&tag=worhisboo-20&linkId=dd8ff9190596f3122a5472f3c6216d57&th=1).

**1.13** I take 1-3 gram of [fish oil](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DS5BI78/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00DS5BI78&linkCode=as2&tag=worhisboo-20&linkId=67264e8e69f8df8e673d23cd93aa4fe8) per day to get enough omega 3 fatty acids.

They ensure healthy hormone production as well as strong bones and ligaments. Fish oil isn't necessarily going to help you build muscle faster, but it will indirectly improve your health and increase the quality of your workouts

**1.14** I take 5 grams of [beta alanine](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EIO4I7A/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00EIO4I7A&linkCode=as2&tag=worhisboo-20&linkId=0eb36e7013c1b931e6e3de40aac5da33&th=1) every day to train harder.

### §§ (f) Meal Frequency & Timing

**1.15** I eat 3 meals a day.

It doesn't matter if you eat 3 or 6 meals or anything in between. Several small means don't boost your metabolism to any meaningful degree. It is impractical to prepare so many meals throughout the day, so I stick with 3.

**1.16** I eat my meals before sunset. 

Your circadian rhythm determines your hunger, metabolism, etc. to peak during daylight, so after sunset you process calories less efficiently. It can cause weight gain, bad blood sugar levels, blood pressure, etc ([National Center for Biotechnology](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6703924/)).

An article summarizing the paper: [Time-restricted eating no more beneficial than caloric restriction in obese patients, study says](https://www.foxnews.com/health/time-restricted-eating-no-more-beneficial-caloric-restriction-obese-patients-study) 

## § 5. Philosophies 

**5.1** Your relationship with food should not be based off of emotion. It should be based off of reason ([Luke Belmar](https://www.facebook.com/reel/1667358753761106?fs=e&s=TIeQ9V&mibextid=0NULKw)).

**5.2** Base decisions on the [hierarchy of evidence](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxujQnHO7t_gUQx5KsxINVjxCkwflrY-ha?si=SebgLf4QTD8v1vtn).

1. Meta-analysis
2. Systematic Reviews
3. Randomized Controlled Trials

[Anecdotes are the lowest form of evidence](https://youtu.be/ZemkG6Vj7hc?si=KGDLBSaBeCR22TQO&t=5654). They are the dataset you use from your unique experiences, which make them not a great microcosm for predicting outcomes generally.
# Article 2: Hard Outcomes

## § 1. Cardiovascular Health

**1.1** ~~Use niacin to [lower LP(a)](https://youtu.be/ZemkG6Vj7hc?si=WcgdlFRKXFpQIhf8&t=1136) if levels are above 75 mg/dL.~~ 

Elevated levels of lipoprotein(a) are considered a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, particularly atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease. 

| Lp(a) Level     | Interpretation                          |
|------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Low              | Less than 30 mg/dL                 |
| Normal           | Between 30 and 75 mg/dL                  |
| High             | Above 75 mg/dL |

**Amendment No. 1**: According to Dr. Danielle Belardo, while niacin reduces LP(a) levels, research suggests it doesn't actually lower cardiovascular risk.

**1.2** Consume Omega-3 Fatty Acids to lower apoB levels. 

Apolipoprotein B (apoB) is a protein that plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism, specifically in the transport of lipids (fats) in the bloodstream.

According to Dr. Danielle Belardo, [lowering apoB levels is the gold standard for reducing cardiovascular risk](https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxlrQVYPi45x-rJauBIsXoRYXg5TkXHM7l?si=pBr_oT7KIFjPOuFs).

Foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, sardines), flaxseeds, and walnuts, may have a positive impact on lipid profiles, including apoB levels.

## Esophageal Cancer

**2.1** Don't drink hot coffee or tea.

3 capfuls of tea per day hotter than 140F is correlated to increases of risk developing esophageal cancer by 90% ([Doctor Mike](https://youtu.be/MZmbizc0MA8?si=gvTqsip14v2MxdcR&t=153)).

| Drink      | Brewing Temp |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| Green Tea  | 175F             |
| Black Tea  | 210F             |
| Herbal Tea | 212F             |
| Coffee           | 200F             |

# Article 3: Hypertrophy

# Article 4: Hypotrophy

# Article 5: Skincare

## § 1. Vitamin C

**1.1** Use Olive Oil [[Smoking & Polyphenols#Vitamin C and Smoking|as a source of Vitamin C]] to stimulate collagen production.

## § 2. Antioxidants

**3.1** [Eat dark chocolate](https://youtu.be/ZemkG6Vj7hc?si=GO2zgtgFZzdcYU7l&t=3337) for its [[Polyphenols|polyphenol]] content.

Polyphenols are often associated with their strong [[Free Radicals#Antioxidants Neutralizing Free Radicals|antioxidant properties]]. Antioxidants neutralize harmful [[Free Radicals|free radicals]] in the body, which stops you from aging as fast.

| Food                   | Polyphenol Subtype     | Polyphenol Content (per serving) |
|------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Apples                 | Flavonoids (Quercetin) | Varies (medium apple: approx. 100 mg) |
| Berries (e.g., blueberries) | Flavonoids (Anthocyanins) | Varies (1 cup of blueberries: approx. 200-300 mg) |
| Broccoli               | Flavonoids (Kaempferol) | Varies (1 cup of chopped broccoli: approx. 30 mg) |
| Green Tea              | Flavonoids (Catechins) | Varies (1 cup of green tea: approx. 30-40 mg) |
| Coffee                 | Phenolic Acids (Chlorogenic Acid) | Varies (1 cup of brewed coffee: approx. 70-350 mg) |
| Red Wine               | Stilbenes (Resveratrol) | Varies (5 oz glass of red wine: approx. 0.1-1.5 mg) |
| **Dark Chocolate** (70-85% cocoa) | Flavonoids (Flavanols) | Varies (1 oz square: approx. 30-50 mg) |
| Flaxseeds              | Lignans                | Varies (1 tablespoon: approx. 30 mg) |
| Sesame Seeds           | Lignans (Sesamin)      | Varies (1 tablespoon: approx. 11 mg) |

# Article 6: Immunity And Sickness Prevention

## § 1. Microbiome

The term "microbiome" refers to the diverse community of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microbes, that live in and on the human body. They serve to stimulate the development and maturation of immune cells (T cells, B cells, and other components of the immune system).

**1.1** [Minimize antibiotic usage](https://youtu.be/ZemkG6Vj7hc?si=JAEL_G2TtQl5L7y_&t=2866) to prevent harm to your microbiome.

Antibiotics are medications designed to kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria, and while they are often necessary to treat bacterial infections, they can also affect the beneficial bacteria in the microbiome.

**1.2** Reduce the consumption of animals given with antibiotics.

Animals in agriculture are often given antibiotics for various reasons, including disease prevention and growth promotion. Unfortunately a human will likely have more antibiotics in him from eating meat than taking antibiotics when he is sick. The good news is that if you stop eating animals, you'll lose those antibiotics.

Is it worth giving up mean? Hard pass. That's a risk that doesn't outweigh the benefits of enjoying meat for me. But I will seek to be somewhat cognizant about finding meat that is not given antibiotics.

**1.3** Eat prebiotic foods to induce microbiome diversity

1. Garlic and Onions: Rich in prebiotics, which serve as food for beneficial bacteria.
2. Asparagus and Leeks: These vegetables contain inulin, a type of prebiotic fiber.
3. [Fruit is one of the best prebiotic foods](https://youtu.be/ZemkG6Vj7hc?si=rFBWXU9xfj0-AIdi&t=4508). 

**1.4** Eat fermented foods to induce microbiome diversity

1. Yogurt: Choose varieties with live and active cultures. Greek yogurt and other cultured dairy products can be beneficial.
2. Kefir: A fermented dairy product that is rich in probiotics.
3. Sauerkraut: Fermented cabbage.
4. Kimchi: A Korean dish made from fermented vegetables, usually cabbage and radishes.

**1.5** Eat fruits with polyphenols to induce microbiome diversity.

Blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries are rich in polyphenols that can support gut health.

**1.6** Reverse juice and add the palp to yogurt.

**1.7** Eat foods seasonally to adapt your microbiome to [the needs of the season](https://youtu.be/ZemkG6Vj7hc?si=AtEs_v0lGnKzLIkw&t=4525).

Caution: Research has not been not on this. Take with a grain of salt until this can be medically demonstrated with the hierarchy of evidence.
# Article 7: Autoimmune Diseases

## § 1. Leaky Gut

# Article 8: Energy and Vitality

## § 1. Vitamins Health

**1.1** [Test For Vitamin & Mineral Deficiencies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7hJ5M0H_4k) yearly to establish a baseline of necessary additions required to supplement your diet.

Options:
1. [Hair Analysis](https://www.traceelements.com/)
2. [Zyto](https://zyto.com/)
3. [AO scan](https://www.solexglobal.com/)

**1.2** [Introduce allergenic foods in children early](https://youtu.be/wqft8n4BupA?si=z0k8YYsnkLFYl9UT&t=116) to avoid allergies later in life.
## § 2. Lectins

**2.1** Pressure cook your beans (or buy them fermented) to mitigate the [[Lectins|lectin content]] and maximize nutrition absorption. 

**2.2** Don't eat fruit out of season. 

If fruits are picked out of season they are picked unripe and [they are loaded with lectins](https://youtu.be/ZemkG6Vj7hc?si=2ZZK77VIT9bjwWYK&t=4900).

# Uncategorized

**#.#** Don't worry. Be Happy.

Long-term stress causes cortisol production which is part of the process that leads to hardening of the arteries end-organ damage (kidneys, etc.) and all sorts of other problems.

Physical stress causes your heart to beat faster and pump much harder, resulting in a large increase in the volume of blood pumped into the arteries. This causes the pressure in your arteries to rise. Over time, the stressed artery walls become much less elastic and harder, which puts strain on the heart when it pumps blood to non-elastic arteries and arterioles. This can lead to heart ventricle hypertrophy, heart failure, and arrhythmias, some of which are dangerous. If physical stress is limited to managed workouts of moderate intensity and length, this can be healthy, but many athletes who overexert on a daily basis develop enlarged hearts and inelastic arteries, which can have negative repercussions. High blood pressure should be checked for every time you visit the doctor, as this is often easily treated.
