# Article 1: Fat Loss

## § 1. Principles

1.1 Avoid [ultra-processed foods](https://youtu.be/ZemkG6Vj7hc?si=Fzr3XRGjcKEMbgSQ&t=3216).

1.2 Avoid unnecessary added sugars.

## § 5. Philosophies 

**5.1** Your relationship with food should not be based off of emotion. [It should be based off of reason](https://www.facebook.com/reel/1667358753761106?fs=e&s=TIeQ9V&mibextid=0NULKw).

# Article 2: Hard Outcomes

## § 1. Cardiovascular Health

**1.1** ~~Use niacin to [lower LP(a)](https://youtu.be/ZemkG6Vj7hc?si=WcgdlFRKXFpQIhf8&t=1136) if levels are above 75 mg/dL.~~ 

Elevated levels of lipoprotein(a) are considered a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, particularly atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease. 

| Lp(a) Level     | Interpretation                          |
|------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Low              | Less than 30 mg/dL                 |
| Normal           | Between 30 and 75 mg/dL                  |
| High             | Above 75 mg/dL |

**Amendment No. 1**: According to Dr. Danielle Belardo, while niacin reduces LP(a) levels, research suggests it doesn't actually lower cardiovascular risk.

**1.2** Consume Omega-3 Fatty Acids to lower apoB levels. 

Apolipoprotein B (apoB) is a protein that plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism, specifically in the transport of lipids (fats) in the bloodstream.

According to Dr. Danielle Belardo, [lowering apoB levels is the gold standard for reducing cardiovascular risk](https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxlrQVYPi45x-rJauBIsXoRYXg5TkXHM7l?si=pBr_oT7KIFjPOuFs).

Foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, sardines), flaxseeds, and walnuts, may have a positive impact on lipid profiles, including apoB levels.

**1.3** [Eat dark chocolate](https://youtu.be/ZemkG6Vj7hc?si=GO2zgtgFZzdcYU7l&t=3337) for its [[Polyphenols|polyphenol]] content.

| Food                   | Polyphenol Subtype     | Polyphenol Content (per serving) |
|------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Apples                 | Flavonoids (Quercetin) | Varies (medium apple: approx. 100 mg) |
| Berries (e.g., blueberries) | Flavonoids (Anthocyanins) | Varies (1 cup of blueberries: approx. 200-300 mg) |
| Broccoli               | Flavonoids (Kaempferol) | Varies (1 cup of chopped broccoli: approx. 30 mg) |
| Green Tea              | Flavonoids (Catechins) | Varies (1 cup of green tea: approx. 30-40 mg) |
| Coffee                 | Phenolic Acids (Chlorogenic Acid) | Varies (1 cup of brewed coffee: approx. 70-350 mg) |
| Red Wine               | Stilbenes (Resveratrol) | Varies (5 oz glass of red wine: approx. 0.1-1.5 mg) |
| **Dark Chocolate** (70-85% cocoa) | Flavonoids (Flavanols) | Varies (1 oz square: approx. 30-50 mg) |
| Flaxseeds              | Lignans                | Varies (1 tablespoon: approx. 30 mg) |
| Sesame Seeds           | Lignans (Sesamin)      | Varies (1 tablespoon: approx. 11 mg) |


# Article 3: Hypertrophy

# Article 4: Hypotrophy

# Article 5: Skincare

## § 1. Vitamin C

**1.1** Use Olive Oil [[Smoking & Polyphenols#Vitamin C and Smoking|as a source of Vitamin C]] to stimulate collagen production.

**1.2** Base decisions on the [hierarchy of evidence](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxujQnHO7t_gUQx5KsxINVjxCkwflrY-ha?si=SebgLf4QTD8v1vtn).

1. Meta-analysis
2. Systematic Reviews
3. Randomized Controlled Trials

Anecdotes are the lowest form of evidence.

# Article 6: Immunity And Sickness Prevention

## § 1. Microbiome

The term "microbiome" refers to the diverse community of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microbes, that live in and on the human body. They serve to stimulate the development and maturation of immune cells (T cells, B cells, and other components of the immune system).

**1.1** [Minimize antibiotic usage](https://youtu.be/ZemkG6Vj7hc?si=JAEL_G2TtQl5L7y_&t=2866) to prevent harm to your microbiome.

Antibiotics are medications designed to kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria, and while they are often necessary to treat bacterial infections, they can also affect the beneficial bacteria in the microbiome.

**1.2** Reduce the consumption of animals given with antibiotics.

Animals in agriculture are often given antibiotics for various reasons, including disease prevention and growth promotion. Unfortunately a human will likely have more antibiotics in him from eating meat than taking antibiotics when he is sick. The good news is that if you stop eating animals, you'll lose those antibiotics.

Is it worth giving up mean? Hard pass. That's a risk that doesn't outweigh the benefits of enjoying meat for me. But I will seek to be somewhat cognizant about finding meat that is not given antibiotics.

**1.3** Eat prebiotic foods to induce microbiome diversity

1. Garlic and Onions: Rich in prebiotics, which serve as food for beneficial bacteria.
2. Asparagus and Leeks: These vegetables contain inulin, a type of prebiotic fiber.

**1.4** Eat fermented foods to induce microbiome diversity

1. Yogurt: Choose varieties with live and active cultures. Greek yogurt and other cultured dairy products can be beneficial.
2. Kefir: A fermented dairy product that is rich in probiotics.
3. Sauerkraut: Fermented cabbage.
4. Kimchi: A Korean dish made from fermented vegetables, usually cabbage and radishes.

**1.5** Eat fruits with polyphenols to induce microbiome diversity

Blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries are rich in polyphenols that can support gut health.

**1.6** Reverse juice and add the palp to yogurt.
# Article 7: Autoimmune Diseases

## § 1. Leaky Gut

# Article 8: Energy and Vitality

## § 1. Lectins

**1.1** Pressure cook your beans (or buy them fermented) to mitigate the [[Lectins|lectin content]] and maximize nutrition absorption.

**#.#** Don't worry. Be Happy.

Long-term stress causes cortisol production which is part of the process that leads to hardening of the arteries end-organ damage (kidneys, etc.) and all sorts of other problems.

Physical stress causes your heart to beat faster and pump much harder, resulting in a large increase in the volume of blood pumped into the arteries. This causes the pressure in your arteries to rise. Over time, the stressed artery walls become much less elastic and harder, which puts strain on the heart when it pumps blood to non-elastic arteries and arterioles. This can lead to heart ventricle hypertrophy, heart failure, and arrhythmias, some of which are dangerous. If physical stress is limited to managed workouts of moderate intensity and length, this can be healthy, but many athletes who overexert on a daily basis develop enlarged hearts and inelastic arteries, which can have negative repercussions. High blood pressure should be checked for every time you visit the doctor, as this is often easily treated.
