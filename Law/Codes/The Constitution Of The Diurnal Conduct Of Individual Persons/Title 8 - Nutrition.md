Long-term stress causes cortisol production which is part of the process that leads to hardening of the arteries end-organ damage (kidneys, etc.) and all sorts of other problems.

Physical stress causes your heart to beat faster and pump much harder, resulting in a large increase in the volume of blood pumped into the arteries. This causes the pressure in your arteries to rise. Over time, the stressed artery walls become much less elastic and harder, which puts strain on the heart when it pumps blood to non-elastic arteries and arterioles. This can lead to heart ventricle hypertrophy, heart failure, and arrhythmias, some of which are dangerous. If physical stress is limited to managed workouts of moderate intensity and length, this can be healthy, but many athletes who overexert on a daily basis develop enlarged hearts and inelastic arteries, which can have negative repercussions. High blood pressure should be checked for every time you visit the doctor, as this is often easily treated.
