| One day a week, each person should lead a Bible study, and present everything they've been going after throughout the week. A time to evaluate themselves with family, to prepare themselves, and spur each other on. Church happens every moment, not every gathering. 1 hour everyday should be devoted to this, and if such a small fraction of your time can't be put toward something eternal, you're are too busy to have a meaningful life.                                                                                                                                   |            |
| Details: it can be a lesson over a chapter of a book each week, it can be a scriptural analysis, it can be a topical study, memory verses, songs, prayer,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |            |

| Possessions are to be kept within the limit of space allotted to the possessor when not in use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |            |
| But encourage one another day after day, as long as it is still called “Today,” so that none of you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin (NASB Hebrews 3:13). The passage does not say “encourage on another every week, specifically on Sunday because that’s when Jesus was resurrected,” but rather, encourage one another daily, because that’s when sin’s deception is, it happens every day, and if you’re only encouraged one out of seven days, what will be the outcome of the remaining seven? Sin must be equalized as often as it persists to be your companion. |            |
| There shall be a complete list of the things which are to be kept clean on erasable sheets, for names to be voluntarily signed until sheets are filled for the week. The names shall be revised at the beginning of each week. There shall be columns for daily responsibility and columns for weekly responsibility.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |            |
| The hurt you feel when you tell the truth is a little shorter and a lot less painful than the hurt you feel when you don’t face the truth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |            |
