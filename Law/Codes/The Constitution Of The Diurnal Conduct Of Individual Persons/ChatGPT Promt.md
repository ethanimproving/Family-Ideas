When generating a document for household maintenance guidelines, use the following formatting structure:

# Article 1: [Article Title]

## ยง 1. [Section Title]

**1.1** [Rule]

**1.2** [Rule]

**1.3** [Rule]

**1.4** [Rule]

**1.5** [Rule]

Repeat this structure for each article and section, ensuring that rules are numbered as 1.1, 1.2, etc. Images should be embedded where appropriate. This format serves as a consistent and organized template for household maintenance documentation.
