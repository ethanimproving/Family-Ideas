# Article 1: Physical Development

## § 1. Nutrition

**1.1** Recognizing the enduring impact of *early childhood nutrition*, as highlighted by the esteemed economist Bjorn Lomborg, parents are encouraged to prioritize investments in their children's nutritional well-being for a substantial and favorable return on the investment in their long-term development ([Jordan Peterson](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/B2Ab9-kxdWg)).

> You can make people stupider by depriving them of nutrition when they're children. I mean, one of the things we know--and this is from Bjorn Lomborg's work, which I would really recommend--Lomborg has put together a team of economists to rank order problems in the world by return on investment in solving them. So, you imagine, you know, maybe there's a hundred problems that beset the world, from starvation to lack of water to lack of sanitary facilities to lack of education to tyrannical governance. Well, you can continue the list in your own imagination. What Lomborg did was consult very high-level economists who were put in teams to find out where you get the biggest return for your foreign policy dollar over, you know, a reasonable stretch of time. And it's clearly the case that if you invest in early childhood nutrition, that pays off at about 250 to 1. ~ Jordan Peterson


## § 3. Financial Provisioning

**3.1** Parents shall provide financial compensation to their children upon hiring them, not exceeding $12,000 per annum, with the option to allocate $6,500 into a Roth IRA and $5,500 into a high-yield savings account ([Preston Seo](https://twitter.com/thelegacyinvest/status/1681750978020913152)). 

**3.2** A weekly allowance will be given by commission of daily chores and tasks completed at Parent's discretion ([Dave Ramsay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eN73ANzGJvU)).

## § 4. Safety

**4.1** Parents shall undertake reasonable measures to mitigate risks associated with the leading causes of death and health-related issues affecting children within their care ([Neil deGrasse Tyson](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/beq7hcmtMzk)).

**4.2** The leading causes of death and health-related issues shall be periodically identified and updated by relevant health authorities or governmental agencies.

**4.3** Parents shall ensure compliance with recommended screenings and health examinations as advised by healthcare professionals and relevant public health authorities.

**4.4** Parents are obliged to implement safety measures, including but not limited to childproofing the home environment, ensuring appropriate use of safety equipment, and promoting awareness of potential hazards.

**4.5** Parents shall actively seek and disseminate information regarding nutrition, physical activity, mental health, and other relevant aspects contributing to overall well-being.

## § 5. Vaccinations

**5.1** In adherence to the enduring principles of familial autonomy and personal liberties, parents are hereby proscribed from compelling the administration of vaccinations upon their children. This inhibition arises from the conviction that purposefully introducing pathogens stands in stark contravention to the hallowed tenets of biblical precedence, specifically those venerating cleanliness and the avoidance of pathogens.

In accordance with the sacred scriptures—Haggai 2:13, Job 14:4, Leviticus 15:13—we are reminded of the divine injunction to refrain from contact with impure entities, including deceased creatures, blood, bodily fluids, diseases, and all that has been tainted by such elements.

In the spirit of upholding these venerable principles, the act of immunization stands in opposition to the holistic concept of health and well-being. This contravention arises from the introduction of fluids laden with viruses, animal constituents, deleterious substances, or those derived from the remains of aborted infants.

[[Vaccinations|Vaccines]] work by introducing the disease to the child, so the child can build an immunity to it. However, the controversy surrounding vaccinations make me more weary of the permanent side effects of injections than the acute protection they provide.

My brother developed allergies after taking vaccines mandated by GISD for his job, after 27 years of never having allergies before. This evidence, among other similar testimonies, are more convincing than the obfuscated publications of scientists who's grants are provided by Big Pharma. 

**5.2** External entities, including educational institutions or employers, are prohibited from interfering with the household's mandate to prioritize pathogen avoidance within the family unit.

I’m marred and laden with mistakes, and my potential is confined to Vader's suite, but my children can reach the potential that I was never able to attain to.*
