"Happy birthday to this beauty. The one that always understands my Office references, the one that loves Jesus with all her heart, the one that is an amazing travel buddy, and the one that has become such a dear sweet friend to me over the last few years!!Thankful for ya and I love you boo üòò‚ù§Ô∏èü•≥. #happybirthday #happybirdday Abigail"

Okay, but honestly, watching The Office would take so much work it makes me not want to put in the effort to understand Amy. **I would rather love someone who thinks it's a dumb show and prefers watching shows with actual meaning, story, and plot, instead of pure crude humor with no purpose except relaxing after a long day.** I don't hate her for it, and I'm not angry, because I realize the only reason I would be angry is that it's a discourse community I don't belong to, so it excludes me from getting the joke. It isn't really righteous indignation where I'm mad because **everyone is perusing foolishness and nonsense**. I'm just so far removed from it that I feel angry because I'm not included. That's all. And once I realize the anger is not justified, I'm no longer angry. I just go, "Oh, that was silly." And I'm free.
