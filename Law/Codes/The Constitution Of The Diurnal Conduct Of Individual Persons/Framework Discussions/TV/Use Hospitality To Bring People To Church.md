So I have this thought about how to bring people to church. I was reading in 1 Peter 4, and in verse 7 he says

> [!Bible] [1 Peter 4:7-10 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/1peter+4:7-10?translation=kjv)
> 7. But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.
> 8. And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.
> 9. Use hospitality one to another without grudging.
> 10. As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.

And then in Hebrews 3:13 it says

> [!Bible] [Hebrews 3:13 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/hebrews+3:13?translation=kjv)
> 13. But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.

We look at the passage, and it says daily. So we can agree that God wants us to do something daily. And what he wants is for us to exhort one another. So this is something happening between the saints. And he says lest we are hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. So the danger is that if we neglect this command, we could become hardened. And I think a lot of us are hardened without knowing it, because that's the nature of being hardened. We watch death on TV, we hear profanity, and it's water off a ducks back. We see Rogue One and we're like, "Oh, it's such a good story." When the Bible says to turn away your eyes from beholding bloodshed. We take pleasure in it. And it says to put away from yourself the froward mouth, and we use TV shows with froward mouths all over for out entertainment.

And then also in Luke 17 Jesus says the last days will be as the days of Noah. (Casual argument)

It's just like when Jesus rebukes the Church at Laodicea, he rebukes them for being lukewarm.

What I'm thinking is that we start bringing people from the neighborhood to dinner at my house, maybe read a few chapters from the Bible, because the Bible says to give attendance to reading, then play a game, then work on Bible memory, then recess to the living room to sing songs, hymns, and spiritual songs.
