I think I've been doing religion wrong. What has it done for me except make me bitter? I wasn't born with hatred for sin. I was taught to hate it. What has religion done for me except taught me to disapprove of others? I was angry at my friends for watching movies with nudity. I was angry at my cousin for using bad words. I was angry at the girl I love for drinking alcohol. Religion has taught me to be angry.

I was watching Spider-Man and there was a moment when one of them said, "I suck," and the other said, "Hold on, stop everything. You're amazing." That grabbed my heart. That was something beautiful that moved me. I realized that's what Mariana needs. She needs someone to tell her she's amazing. She needs someone to make her feel good about herself. She needs someone to encourage her, and be there for her, and to always be her cheerleader.

I'm not what way. I'm the opposite. I criticize her for being drunk. I get mad at her and call her a sinner. I showed her verses that drunkards are unworthy of God's kingdom. Built into the gospel at it's foundation is the premise that we are sinners. We go out and tell people they're worse than they think. What is beautiful about that? I don't feel beautiful. My job is to show the beauty of Christ, because we weren't made to look in front of a mirror and be impressed with ourselves. And yet that's the ultimate virtue in the world. The world is telling us that we all need to build each other up, and encourage each other, and it sounds so right. I love that. But I feel like I have to surrender religion to do it.

It's a miracle that Mariana puts up with me. She's so kind. I think she's the only person in the world who can accept me. And I want to be good, and to get better, I just don't know what good is anymore. I don't have direction. Not because there's nobody to give me direction, but because there's tok many people giving me conflicting directions. I don't know what's true anymore. I feel like Stedfast lacks grace. Not to each other, but to strangers. I know we lreach the gospel, but we're so quick to move on. We don't listen to people. We treat them as a sick hamster that needs to be injected with the gospel and then we move on after we "fix" them. It doesn't feel like I always imagined. It's not the same as when I first began.

Look at your pornography. Wear what you want. Sleep around and expirament. Use any language. Drink yourself drunk. Tomorrow we all die. Who cares how we live? Why can't we just accept each other?

Faithless. These are the thoughts of someone who does not read the Bible.  These are the thoughts of someone who hasn't been inspired by the characters in the stories of of the Old Testament. The these are the thoughts of someone who hasn't seen that it's worth it to sacrifice lower pleasures for higher pleasures.
