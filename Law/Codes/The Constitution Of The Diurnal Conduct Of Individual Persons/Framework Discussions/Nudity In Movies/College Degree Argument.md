What were you saying I’m wrong about? My opinion from the beginning is that it is a waste of time and money to spend 4 years and $150,000 for a degree when I can get hired without it. And you are telling me that is wrong. When I brought up the fact that I was able to get a good job without it, you still think I’m wrong. Which means you think it would be worth it for me to get a degree.

You’re not worried about the company, it doesn’t make any difference to them weather they choose me or anyone else. You aren’t saying, “I’m worried that company will lose good talent because they require a BA.” You are worried I won’t get a job at other companies because I don’t have a BA.

If I have to constantly excuse myself to not be wrong, that proves that you are always challenging me. You don’t challenge somebody you trust.
