Gill warned me you would roll your eyes at saying that, and maybe it was just how I was raised.

Yes I am deeply convicted about that. My resolve is to never intentionally look at a TV show or a website where I know I will see photos or films of nudity. I have 12 reasons for it, and I'm willing to be wrong, but I would like to talk about them one at a time with you and let you respond. Do you accept my challenge?? ü§∫

and I plan to teach them to my children, and I would like to talk about them with you.

### **1. Don‚Äôt be a hypocrite.**

Most Christians are hypocrites in watching nudity because, on the one hand, they say by their watching that this is okay, and, on the other hand, they know deep down they would not want their daughter or their wife to be playing this role.

Okay I will accept that. Just because I watch vilence in movies doesn't mean I think it's okay. But that brings me to another point:

*2. Nudity is not make-believe.*

Nudity is not like murder and violence on the screen. That is make-believe. Nobody really gets killed. But nudity is not make believe. These actresses are really naked in front of the camera, doing exactly what the director says to do with their legs and their hands and their breasts, and they are standing there and they are naked there in front of millions of people for the world to see.and that's not okay because of ppint x, x, amd x.

The reason peoducers put nude scenes in TV is because men like to exploit women to lust for them. There's a reason there aren't sex scenes with fat and ugly people. If people stopped watching shows with nudity, producers would stop including it.

And it's not okay for me to support that because of point 1.

*2. Don‚Äôt do that which can cause you to sin with your heart and mind.*

Seeing naked women causes men and women ‚Äî women seeing naked men ‚Äî to sin with their minds and their desires, and often with their bodies. If Jesus told us to guard our hearts by gouging out our eyes to prevent lust, how much more would he say, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt watch it‚Äù?

A long time ago I made the resolve never intentionally to look at a TV show or a website where I know I will see photos or films of nudity. Never. That is my resolve.

I have 12 reasons but I don't want to bombard you with them. But

. I would like to give you one reason at a time and let you respond

I want us to come into an agreement. One of us is right and one of is is wrong, and whoever it is I want us to know the truth.

You can watch whatever you want and that's your responsibility, and I won't be mad one way or the other, but my goal is to convince you not to watch it.

If this is the word of God, the all powerful creator of the universe who can do anything, and he loves you so much that he died on the cross for you, and he wants to have a relationship with you, don't you want that? You have his Holy Spirit inside of you everyday

Okay this os good. If you believe it, then everything else will fall into place.

I know you probably think I'm a crazy radical, but this is normal Christianity.

Hahaha then I invite you into normal.

I don't care as much

That's okay, nobody practices the Bible perfectly.

Okay good.

Okay perfect, then let's start there.

Hahaha well I expect that because you grew up Catholic right üòõ

Hahaha okay I see, you probably think I'm a crazy radical. Do you know why I try my best to follow God?

The only difference between you and me and that nobody has motivated you to live for God.

Then let's park here for a little while.

The difference between people in the Spirit and people in the flesh in confession.

Then if you believe it's the

I know it can be super annoying when people give you a bunch of sermons they like, so you don't have to watch it if you don't want to, but I would really love if you took the time. It explains so much of what motivates me

There's so much to say, but if I had to condense it into one phrase it's this: "God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him." It's like if Felipe said to you, "Mariana, it's Valentines day, and I planned an evening with you because nothing makes me happier then spending time with you." You would never think of saying, "Felipe, you are so selfish! All you think about is what will make *you* happy. What would make *you're* evening great." Why not respond that way? It's because when he delights in you, you are glorified. You get the glory, he gets the pleasure.

And the same with God, when we love him, and delight in him, he gets the glory, and we get the joy. It isn't a choice between our happiness and serving God. Loving God is what will make us the most happy.

My favorite verse in the Bible is Psalm 16:11. Notice it says "fullness of joy" and "pleasures forevermore." The only reason anybody sins is because sin promises pleasure. But the pleasures of sin are short lived. And not only are they short, but they are weak. They aren't as intense and full and alive as the joy when you have a good relationship with God.

There are 4 main reasons and a bunch of little reasons, but he main one is because I want to have relationship with Jesus.

Because God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him.

I want to invite you to have a relationship with Jesus. I really want that for you. It's my top desire.

You've spent a long time
