Lord, be my calm in a moment of disorientation. I'm angry. For 2 years I liked Mariana because I saw something pure and innocent in her nature. I don't see that right now. I don't see that anymore. She is so worldly. She thinks so many false things:

- Divorce is okay.
- Drinking is okay.
- Fornication is okay.
- TV shows with nudity and sex is okay.
- Tattoos are okay.

I'm mad. I'm fueled with anger. My blood is boiling with hatred, and my heart is racing with distress. But I'm not just mad. I'm confused.

I wasn't angry when I learned about her thoughts on divorce. I expected it, and I expected to be able to change her mind, because I have compelling and beautiful arguments prepared to persuade her. And I delivered them, and they worked. But for one reason or another, when she indicated that she watches Game Of Thrones, that's when I became angry. I wasn't mad that she lived with Filipe, but I'm mad that she watches GOT.

And I have to ask myself: why?

Here's why. To me, living with Felipe represents temptation. Watching GOT represents compromise. One says, "I'm doing something that people with judge me for, and it's naughty." And the other says, "There's nothing wrong with nudity." This news is the only news that has ever made me want to hate her.

When Andrea told me she watched GOT, it wasn't a deal breaker. Why do I expect Mariana to be pure of heart? Why do I hold her to a higher standard than Andrea? I need to remember she's worldly and I have to lead her. I love her. That's the difference.

Why is merely watching a TV sbkw with a 2 minute nude scene worse to me than a year she slent sleeping with another guy? My best explanation is that I've been brainwashed. Anna would gasp with disgust when someone said a bad word in a movie, and I learned that she is over an dramatic, holier than thou, stricter than the Bible person. They condemned violence, cussing, and provocative dressware, and I learned to accept them. Why have I never accepted nudity?

Lord, teach me. Violence is fake. Nudity is a real woman who's really naked. John Piper. I fall into sin sometimes, but watching a movie that I know has nudity is compromising.

Maybe the reason I'm okay with her stance on divorce but not nudity is because I've never been able to persuade myself that nudity is harmful. I didn't get that from the Bible. I got it from people. I didn't get it from, "Wbosoever looketh on a woman..." We all do that regardless kf nudity. That's called being a hypocrite. This is a good test of knowing whether you've beem brainwashed: are you confident in your ability to persuade someone else? If not, you have no faith in your arguments because you've never been persuade. You've been indoctrinated.

I don't know why I believed you were so special. You're just like everyome else.

When I thought you were pure and special I couldn't resist you. I wanted to take you to bed. Now I'm disgusted by the thought of sleeping with you. It makes me uncomfortable. I don't want you now. I want to want you. The only thing blocking me is my principles, and I'm almost willing to shake them for you. Almost. I'm almost willing to make excuses for you and say, "If I patiently guide her, and nurture her, and love her, and trach her from the Bible little by little, then she will believe the Bible." What virtues do I know about you that make you worth it?

One. Just one. You're level headed and willing to talk. If you have that one virtue, all the others will fall into place. If you are balanced enough to talk about the issues, then the only reason you wouldn't change your mind is if I'm not compelling enough. If my arguments aren't beautiful enough. They that are of God heareth God's words. If you're saved, you'll hear it. God will teach you as I teach you.

Against my love for you, it is impossible for me to convince myself that these
