I tell her everything that she's doing wrong. Why would she want to be with me?

I'm starting to realize that being pretty isn't the most important thing to me. I don't have to take it by faith right now. I naturally want to ask Mariana how many guys she has slept with, and then teach her that fornication is wrong, and make her understand. I want to drive her to confess her faults. What drives me to want to drive her to do that?

I want to push her to give up drinking. I want to convince her to shun movies with nudity. I want her to have her own hunger for righteousness. I can feed her God's rules, but she will be a child choking down unwanted vegetables until she wants it on her own. I will be odious to her unless she wants it in her own. I need her to want righteousness. I love her and I need her to hunger for righteousness. It's so important to me. More important than her beautiful face, unmatched kindness, sharp mind, and sexy body, is her fear of God.
