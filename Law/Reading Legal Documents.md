1. **Codes:** In certain legal systems, codes are the highest level of organization. A legal code is a systematic collection or compilation of laws. Titles, parts, and other subdivisions are then used within the code to organize specific legal topics.
	
2. **Volumes:** In some legal publications, especially comprehensive legal encyclopedias or treatises, you may find volumes. Volumes can contain multiple titles or parts and are used to organize a large body of legal information.
	
3. **Books:** Some legal codes or compilations are organized into parts or books that encompass multiple titles. Parts or books are higher-level divisions that group related subject matter together.
	
4. **Titles:** "Titles" are another organizational unit used in statutes. A title is a major division within a code or statute, grouping related subject matter together. Titles often cover broad areas of law, and within each title, you'll find articles, sections, and other subdivisions.
	
5. **Article:** In legal contexts, an article is a larger division within a document. It's often used in constitutions or statutes to organize different subject matters. For example, "Article II" of the U.S. Constitution deals with the executive branch.
    
6. **Section:** A section is a smaller division within an article or statute. It's a way of organizing and numbering specific provisions. For instance, you might refer to "Section 2" of a law to pinpoint a particular part of it.
	- The "ยง" symbol (section symbol) is used to represent the word "section" in legal citations. For example, you might see something like "ยง 2(3)" to refer to Section 2, Subsection 3 of a law.
    
7. **Subsection or Subpart:** Some laws have subsections or subparts within sections. They are often designated by letters or numbers, such as "Section 3(a)" or "Section 3(1)."
    
8. **Paragraph:** In legal writing, paragraphs are sometimes numbered for reference. For example, "Paragraph 4" might be cited to highlight a specific part of a section.
    
9. **Clause:** A clause is a distinct part of a legal instrument, such as a contract or statute. It may be labeled with letters or numbers. For instance, "Clause (b)" might be referenced.
    
10. **Subparagraph:** In some cases, particularly in more complex legal documents, subparagraphs may be used to further divide clauses. They are often designated by lowercase letters (e.g., "Clause (b)(i)").
    
11. **Division:** Some legal documents may be divided into parts or divisions. For example, "Division 1" might cover one aspect of a law, while "Division 2" covers another.
