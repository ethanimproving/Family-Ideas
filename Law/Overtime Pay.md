It is illegal for companies in Texas to ask wage employees not to track overtime hours under the Fair Labor Standards Act ([29 U.S.C §207(a)(1)](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title29-section207&num=0&edition=prelim),  [FLSA 13(a)(1)](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title29-section213&num=0&edition=prelim), and 13(a)(17)).

> No employer shall employ any of his employees for a workweek **longer than forty hours** unless such employee receives compensation for his employment in excess of the hours above specified at a rate not less than one and **one-half times the regular rate** at which he is employed.


The Fair Labor Standards Act is codified at [29 U.S.C §§201-219](https://uscode.house.gov/browse/prelim@title29/chapter8&edition=prelim) in the US Code of Federal Regulations.
