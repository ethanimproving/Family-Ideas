# Finding A Seat At Church
 1. Look for the number of seats available to suit your needs.
 2. Ask the person sitting on that row, "Is anyone sitting here?"
 3. If no, thank him and take your seats.
 4. If yes, say, "No problem," walk to the back, and look again around the building for more seats.
 5. If no seats are available, ask an usher.
