Watching YouTubers like [thatwasepic](https://www.youtube.com/@ThatWasEpic11) and [angrypicnic](https://www.youtube.com/@angrypicnic) and [BigDawsTv](https://www.youtube.com/@BigDawsTv) can have a positive impact on personal social skills. We can discuss the potential benefits and their implications.

1. **Observational Learning**: Watching YouTubers engage in social experiments may provide opportunities for observational learning. Viewers can observe the interactions, behaviors, and techniques demonstrated by these YouTubers and potentially incorporate them into their own social interactions.
    
2. **Exposure to Social Situations**: By watching these videos, viewers can gain exposure to various social situations and observe different social dynamics. This exposure can help broaden their understanding of social interactions, norms, and cues, potentially enhancing their social skills and confidence.
    
3. **Insight into Communication Strategies**: These YouTubers often employ specific communication strategies or techniques in their videos. By observing these strategies, viewers may gain insights into effective communication, such as humor, body language, or conversation starters. They can then apply these insights to their own interactions.
    
4. **Understanding Social Reactions**: Social experiments often involve reactions from the people involved, including the YouTubers and the individuals they interact with. Observing these reactions can provide viewers with a deeper understanding of how their own actions may be perceived and how others may respond in certain situations.
    
5. **Empathy and Perspective-Taking**: Some social experiments may address social issues or challenges, allowing viewers to empathize with the participants or gain different perspectives. This can foster empathy, understanding, and an appreciation for diverse viewpoints, which are important aspects of developing social skills.
    

It's important to note that while watching these videos may provide some insights and exposure to social situations, it is not a substitute for real-life experiences or interpersonal connections. Building personal social skills typically requires active engagement, practice, and feedback in real-world social interactions. Nonetheless, observing and reflecting on social experiments can potentially offer some benefits in terms of broadening one's understanding and awareness of social dynamics.
