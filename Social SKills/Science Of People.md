# What Is Science Of People?

Science of People is an online platform and organization founded by Vanessa Van Edwards, a behavioral investigator, author, and public speaker. The Science of People focuses on understanding human behavior, social dynamics, and the science behind building effective relationships and communication skills.

The organization offers various resources, courses, and training programs aimed at improving interpersonal skills, enhancing nonverbal communication, and understanding the psychology behind human interactions. Some key areas of focus within the Science of People include body language, personality types, social intelligence, and effective communication strategies.

The Science of People provides research-based insights and practical techniques to help individuals navigate social situations, build rapport, and create meaningful connections. The organization combines scientific research, data analysis, and real-world application to offer practical advice for personal and professional growth.

Through online courses, workshops, articles, and videos, Science of People provides tools and strategies that can be applied to various aspects of life, including social interactions, networking, leadership, dating, and job interviews.

It's worth noting that while Science of People aims to provide evidence-based insights into human behavior, individual experiences and cultural contexts can also play a role in shaping interpersonal dynamics. Therefore, it's important to consider multiple perspectives and adapt strategies to specific situations and relationships.
