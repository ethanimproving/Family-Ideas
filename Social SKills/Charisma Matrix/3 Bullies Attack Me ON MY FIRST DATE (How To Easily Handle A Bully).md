# First Date: Handling Clowns at a Bar

## Introduction

On a first date, you find yourself facing three guys who start clowning on you in front of your date. This transcript shares a personal experience of a similar situation and provides insights into how to handle it effectively.

## The Setting

The story takes place at a restaurant in Dallas, Texas, with a modern and contemporary atmosphere. The narrator and the girl he is on a date with are seated at a bar. Three guys are seated to his right, and they have been drinking.

## Engaging with the Guys

The narrator strikes up a conversation with the guys next to him, who happen to live nearby. They have a friendly interaction, joking around and having a good time. During this time, the girl leaves to use the restroom.

## Change in Energy

Upon the girl's return, the dynamics shift because the guys notice her and become interested. They decide to start making jokes at the narrator's expense, attempting to make him look bad to impress the girl.

## Handling the Situation

The narrator recognizes the intentions behind their comments and decides to respond in a way that maintains a positive and lighthearted tone. When one of the guys asks about his haircut, the narrator makes a self-deprecating joke about cutting his hair himself. This catches the guys off guard, and they don't respond well to the joke.

## Ignoring and Disengaging

To avoid escalating the situation, the narrator chooses to ignore the guys entirely. He turns his shoulder away from them, focuses on the girl, and continues the conversation as if nothing happened. By not giving them any attention, he prevents further interaction and maintains a higher status.

## Key Lessons

1. Responding with humor and maintaining a lighthearted tone can defuse tension and show confidence.
2. Ignoring and disengaging from negative interactions can be more effective than engaging in a battle of wits.
3. Recognizing the power dynamics and social support of the other party can help you navigate the situation strategically.
4. Having a strong and convincing tone of voice can enhance your presence and protect you from being an easy target.
5. Cultivating self-confidence and displaying high status can leave a lasting impression on others.

By handling the situation with confidence, humor, and strategic disengagement, the narrator successfully diffused the tension and maintained a positive image in front of his date.
