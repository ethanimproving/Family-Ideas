# Story: Making a Positive First Impression in an Apartment Hallway

Today, I had an encounter with a girl I didn't know in my apartment hallway, and I want to share the three positive things I did, as well as the one negative thing I did. By learning from my mistake, you can have an easier time approaching neighbors or new people in any setting.

## Step 1: Empathy and Observing Non-Verbal Cues

As I was walking home from the coffee shop, I entered the elevator in my building. Just as the doors were closing, a girl and her energetic black Labradoodle entered with me. The dog seemed out of control, making the other girl visibly uncomfortable.

## Step 2: Establishing Rapport through Empathetic Conversation

To break the ice, I decided to show empathy towards the situation. I remarked, "Can you believe having to live with that 24 hours a day?" She responded positively, indicating that she appreciated someone else acknowledging her feelings. This opened up the conversation and allowed her to share her thoughts on having a dog-free home while still loving dogs.

## Step 3: Building on Common Ground and Engaging in Conversation

Continuing the conversation, I asked if she had just moved into the building since I noticed she got off on the same floor. She confirmed that she had recently moved in and mentioned working at a nearby gym. Here's where I made a mistakeâ€”I considered mentioning the gym, but asking about her specific unit was inappropriate.

## Step 4: Wrapping Up the Interaction with Respect and Ease

Recognizing my mistake, I immediately backtracked on the inappropriate question by saying, "Really cool, I'm sure I'll see you around." This helped alleviate any discomfort caused by my previous misstep. By ending the conversation casually and respectfully, I maintained a positive tone and left a good impression.

## Key Lessons:

1. Show empathy and observe non-verbal cues to gauge the comfort level of others.
2. Establish rapport through empathetic conversation, allowing the other person to open up and contribute more.
3. Avoid asking personal or intrusive questions, especially regarding someone's living situation.
4. Address any mistakes or missteps immediately, acknowledging the error and redirecting the conversation.
5. Conclude the interaction in a friendly and casual manner, leaving the door open for future encounters.

By following these four steps, you can approach new people confidently and create a positive first impression in various social settings. Remember to be aware of boundaries and always prioritize respect and comfort in your interactions.
