# Where to Park

For [Extended Campus Parking](https://newjetnet.aa.com/docs/DOC-35379) , inform Campus Security at [campus.parking@aa.com](mailto:campus.parking@aa.com). You can park in the [SRO building](https://goo.gl/maps/XvVK93NVmJP1kCsP7) (where there is surveillance to protect your car) and walk over to the [Flight Academy shuttles](https://newjetnet.aa.com/docs/DOC-10664) (under/across the bridge to [Crewmember Way](https://www.google.com/maps/place/4501+Crewmember+Way,+Fort+Worth,+TX+76155/@32.8311043,-97.0639531,19z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x864e80f6e15b8fa3:0x6628989cab4efd03!8m2!3d32.8318658!4d-97.063454)) to take you to the AA gates.

You can reach Aries Dispatch 24/7 at **972-499-7787**.

Alternatively, you can use TheParkingSpot app, make an account, and use the AA corporate code. This will allow you to park there for roughly $4 a night. Preferably choose the parking in the North Parking Lot as it is closer to the AA terminals. They also allow you to change/cancel your parking reservation up to an hour before for free.

As explained in [this article](https://passport-photo.online/cvs-pharmacy-passport-photo), simply create a 4x6 photo-grid of your 2x2 passport photo using an [online tool](https://www.idphoto4you.com/) and get it printed at [CVS](https://www.cvs.com/photo/create/builder?sku=CommerceProduct_7182&category=prints) or [Walgreens](https://photo.walgreens.com/create/builder?sku=CommerceProduct_7182&category=prints), or [Walmart](https://photos3.walmart.com/project_edit/standard/dec932b7e58b211daaca285775f032bao668537303).
![](https://i.imgur.com/CmuqV23.jpg)

Note that it is against company policy for CVS to printout these passport photos since they are greedy money-grubbing vultures who want to charge you $15, so make sure there's no indication that it's a passport photo if you use them. You can also pay to [get your photo modified](https://www.123passportphoto.com/).

## Proof of Citizenship:

Make sure your Birth Certificate has the "I" on it to indicate you were born at a hospital. If you were not born at a hospital, they will require you to present the [**long form**](https://abroad.tamu.edu/StudyAbroad/media/Study-Abroad-Image/Birth-Certificate-Info-Sheet.pdf) original birth certificate.
