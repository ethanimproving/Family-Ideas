## Airport to Airbnb

# How to get around

There are a lot of Taxi's at the airport, about $50. Otherwise there are several busses that will honk at you on the side of the road. If you indicate you want to ride, they will stop for you.

The most common mode of public transportation on the Island of Nassau is the Jitney Buses. 

The Jitney is the most inexpensive form of transportation on Nassau, it’s charged by distance so most routes are between $1-$3 per trip. 

The Jitney buses don’t have set schedules or timetables, if you see one you just wave your hand to get it to stop. If the bus doesn’t stop for you, it’s likely just because there was no room left and then you have to wait for the next one.
