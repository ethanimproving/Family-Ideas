# Why Mariana Doesn’t Like Ethan To Touch Her All The Time

## Public Space
She is worried that we will be caught, and she doesn’t like to be naked in public, and when I persist she feels that I am not considering her feelings, which makes her feel disrespected.

There are two emotions at play here. The first is fear, because she doesn’t want to be embarrassed by being seen naked. And when I persist, fear moves into frustration, because I am pressuring her to do something she doesn’t want to do. And I’m not getting her permission, just going for it.

However, I don’t care if she wants to be naked in public, because I trust her and know she won’t fuck another guy just because he shows her attention. So why should I care if other guys know that she’s hot?

### Pit in her stomach
Over dinner at BBQ Chicken on Spring Creek, as I was expressing the adrenaline rush of having sex in public places, she revealed to me that while she enjoys it while it's happening, she gets a bad feeling in the pit of her stomach before and afterwards.

#### Incompatibility
After pondering for a moment about our differences, I reluctantly submitted the idea that we may be incompatible, because I find it so excited and thrilling, and she finds the same thing fearful. She thought about it for a moment and said she was not comparing me, but she has been through a sexual incompatibility in a relationship before. Realizing she was talking about Felipe, I retorted that they had a good relationship, to which she responded they almost broke up because of it.

#### Hypocrisy
I recognized the hypocrisy immediately, because when she told me months before that Felipe became indignant with her when she didn't want to have sex, I perceived right judgment in an instant against Felipe, because he had no right to have sex with a girl that he is not married to. Anger is the result of a deviation from expectation, and he has no right to expect something that is hers to give at her discretion, especially sex. I told her this was a "Thou art the man" moment from Nathan the prophet, because I can clearly see what's wrong with this situation applied to other people, but I had a scotoma in my own life, not recognizing I was doing the same thing Felipe was doing. So I confessed to her that I have no right to be disappointed about something like this, to which she replied by thanking me for talking this through because when she tried to talk with Felipe it didn't go well.

#### What do you need that fear for?
I asked her later if she believed it was a rational fear or an irrational fear, and if she's willing to work on that fear to kill it, to which she replied yes without needing time to consider. At Six Flags I showed her [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFIB05LGtMs) of Will Smith explaining that the point of maximum danger is the point of minimum fear, and it didn't make sense to be maximally afraid when he was safe in his bed 16 hours before skydiving. She agreed to work through her fear of being caught having sex in public places, realizing it was something important to me.

## Interruption
She also sometimes feels that the sexual advances interrupts the conversation.

## Tired
Tonight was past midnight after an almost breakup conversation in the car and she was too tired.

## Messy
She’s on her period and she doesn’t want to have to cleanup and shower.
