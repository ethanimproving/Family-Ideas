# Why Mariana Doesn’t Like Ethan To Touch Her All The Time

## Public Space
She is worried that we will be caught, and she doesn’t like to be naked in public, and when I persist she feels that I am not considering her feelings, which makes her feel disrespected.

There are two emotions at play here. The first is fear, because she doesn’t want to be embarrassed by being seen naked. And when I persist, fear moves into frustration, because I am pressuring her to do something she doesn’t want to do. And I’m not getting her permission, just going for it.

However, I don’t care if she wants to be naked in public, because I trust her and know she won’t fuck another guy just because he shows her attention. So why should I care if other guys know that she’s hot?

### Pit in her stomach
Over dinner at BBQ Chicken on Spring Creek, as I was expressing the adrenaline rush of having sex in public places, she revealed to me that while she enjoys it while it's happening, she gets a bad feeling in the pit of her stomach before and afterwards.

#### Incompatibility
After pondering for a moment about our differences, I reluctantly submitted the idea that we may be incompatible, because I find it so excited and thrilling, and she finds the same thing fearful. She thought about it for a moment and said she was not comparing me, but she has been through a sexual incompatibility in a relationship before. Realizing she was talking about Felipe, I retorted that they had a good relationship, to which she responded they almost broke up because of it.

#### Hypocrisy
I recognized the hypocrisy immediately, because when she told me months before that Felipe became indignant with her when she didn't want to have sex, I perceived right judgment in an instant against Felipe, because he had no right to have sex with a girl that he is not married to. Anger is the result of a deviation from expectation, and he has no right to expect something that is hers to give at her discretion, especially sex. I told her this was a "Thou art the man" moment from Nathan the prophet, because I can clearly see what's wrong with this situation applied to other people, but I had a scotoma in my own life, not recognizing I was doing the same thing Felipe was doing. So I confessed to her that I have no right to be disappointed about something like this, to which she replied by thanking me for talking this through because when she tried to talk with Felipe it didn't go well.

#### What do you need that fear for?
I asked her later if she believed it was a rational fear or an irrational fear, and if she's willing to work on that fear to kill it, to which she replied yes without needing time to consider. At Six Flags I showed her [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFIB05LGtMs) of Will Smith explaining that the point of maximum danger is the point of minimum fear, and it didn't make sense to be maximally afraid when he was safe in his bed 16 hours before skydiving. She agreed to work through her fear of being caught having sex in public places, realizing it was something important to me.

## Interruption
She also sometimes feels that the sexual advances interrupts the conversation.

## Tired
Tonight was past midnight after an almost breakup conversation in the car and she was too tired.

## Messy
She’s on her period and she doesn’t want to have to cleanup and shower.

# Period Sex
I had sex with my woman during her period for the first time today. It was in a bathroom by a pool at Lago Vista. She let me take her tampon out and replace it with my dick. I sat on the toilet while she climbed on top and rode me. It was only a minute until she said, “I’m going to come.” And a minute longer until someone knocked on the door. “Hold up,” I shouted as we came up with an alibi. Mariana said, “We were walking and something pinched my foot. And we were just cleaning it up.” That was a better story than anything I was coming up with. When we came out, luckily nobody was there.

Other than the adventure, the sex felt exactly the same. Just as pleasurable. I couldn’t see the blood until after I pulled out. It dripped down her leg and I was worried it would get on the dress she was still wearing. It was unbuttoned from earlier when I took hold of her breasts and licked them, and sucked them until we fucked. The sex was fantastic, with an added element of mischief because we were in a public bathroom. It’s something scandalous and wrong, which makes it a different kind of experience. It adds to the fun of it. And it gave me a taste to do more of it, with more danger and more scandal. I love the woman I did it with, and her sexy sense of adventure turns me on. I want to fuck here everywhere we go. And I want to feel her cold mouth on my dick, sucking it like a popsicle.

## Dark Towel
Later on I suggested we buy a dark towel and leave it in my car for any occasions that we want to have sex during her period. She then communicated that she doesn't intend to have sex during her period as a general practice. I was disappointed and exclaimed, "Forever? 5 days is a long time to go without sex." She explained that she gets cranky during the first days and may not be in the mood. The first 2 days made sense to me, because she is in pain, but the remaining 3 she seemed pretty normal to me. And we read that period sex can relieve mensural cramps. I am still hoping she changes her mind about that.

# Making Out

Kissing someone can be the most beautiful feeling. But as things start to get hot and heavy, it’s a little difficult to know what to do with your hands. You seem to know exactly where you want to be touched but when it comes to the woman you don’t want to assume anything. You want to make sure your partner has a good time without making them feel like you’re too awkward to deal with your own hands. We get it guys.

The struggle is very real. Which is exactly why we reached out to Delhi-based Sexologist, Dr Madhusudan to tell you about the 7 places women want to be touched while kissing. Treat this like your handbook and you’ll never go wrong!

## 1. Hold Her Hands

Fingers are the lesser-known erogenous zones on a woman’s body. Hold her hands, play with her fingers, use her hands as much as you can. Don’t mistake holding hands with something that can’t be sexy. If you pay close attention to how she’s holding your hand or how tightly she’s holding it, you’ll know which kissing move she enjoys the most.

## 2. Hold Her Waist

It’s a tried and tested classic move all romantic films vouch for. There’s something not-so-sexual yet intimate about being held by the waist, women really like it. Especially when you’re just going for a passionate makeout session, holding her by the waist is a great way to get started.   

## 3. Go For The Butt

This one can be a little tricky. If you’re uncertain whether she’ll like it or not, then you should wait till you know her better. If you’re with your girlfriend and the kiss isn’t particularly sexual, grabbing her butt will definitely turn up the heat. But before you do anything, please make sure you both are on the same page. Consent is everything.

## 4. Hold Her Face

It doesn’t have to be as mechanical as it sounds. According to Dr Madhusudan, holding a woman’s face while kissing makes the situation a lot more romantic. Add intimacy to the kiss by gently holding her face and pulling it towards you. Feel free to move your hands around and caress her earlobes, neck and cheeks. It can be a turn on for them.

## 5. Caress Her Breasts

This might seem like the wrong thing to do if you’re getting intimate with this woman for the first time, but it can instantly make the kiss so much sexier. But then again, it all comes down to knowing whether she’ll be okay with it. If it makes your partner uncomfortable, it’s best to avoid this move.

## 6. Thighs

We already told you that a woman’s inner thighs are one of the pleasure spots that never fail to excite her. Since the thighs are so close to the vagina, gently stroking them will set the mood right for some great foreplay. It’s a great way to move beyond her upper body and explore her legs a little.

## 7. Run Your Fingers Through Her Hair

According to Dr Madhusudan, this is a move you can never go wrong with. Whether you’re kissing her for the first time and not sure what to do with your hands or whether you’re with your longtime girlfriend, this move always works! To take the sexiness up a notch, you can start running your fingers through her hair and then pull it. Only do this if you know your partner will be comfortable with it or if you’ve had a conversation about the same. (Staff)
