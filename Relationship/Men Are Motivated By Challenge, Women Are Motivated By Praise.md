they do not get much from a challenge. If you want a girl to feel love and want her to do something more you praise her. So you compliment her and show her love. But for men you have to be like, "Do it now." Like if you're lifting weights, you're not gonna be like, "You look so good, you look so strong." You're like, "Do it now. You're a pussy." That's the difference between men is we get motivated from challenge and [[A Priceless Woman#Women Want To Be Respected, Valued, and Praised|women get motivated from praise.]]
