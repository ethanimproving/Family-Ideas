What trouble are you causing tonight
Are you down to hang out later this week?
Are you still down to let me take you out later this week
Are you still down to let me take you on a date later this week?

Ok cool. Does weds or thurs night work for you

I have so many ideas. If you still want take watchÂ Joker I know they have showings at the Galleria and Northpark mall.

I know we talked about seeing Joker. Let's go to Northpark Mall to watch it and we can walk around afterwards.

I know we talked about seeing Joker.

Â Let's go toÂ Northpark Mall has afternoon showings.

I know we talked about seeing Joker.Â We can get an early lunch at Northpart mall, hit the AMC afternoon showing, and then find a tennis court or a park closish to Emma's day care until it's time to pick her up. Game?

ACTUALLY maybe this would be a perfect chance for you to introduce me to one of your Mexican restaurants that I couldn't pronounce if I tried ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£

Do you want to do lunch in a cool place like the mall with less good food, or at a less cool place like a normal restaurant with better food

the Galleria doesn't have any showings before 4:15

How long canÂ I have you for?
When does Emma need to be picked up from Day Care?

I know this bar with amazing sangria called Barcelona. Let's eat there. Does 9 or 10 work for you?

Awesome I'm looking forward to it
