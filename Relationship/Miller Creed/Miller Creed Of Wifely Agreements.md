# Respect To The Man

## Call Him Sir
Calling the man of the house "sir" and "lord" show respect to him.

> [!Bible] [1 Peter 3:6 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/1peter+3:6?translation=kjv)
> 6. Even as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.

## Never talk about previous relationships

A man wants to be your Aladdin and show you the world. He wants to give you experiences you've never had before.

## Stay Off Your Phone

When a girlfriend is in the presence of her man, he is worthy of her full attention. Being on your phone when he is engaging in conversation with you conveys that you are uninterested and do not care to speak.
