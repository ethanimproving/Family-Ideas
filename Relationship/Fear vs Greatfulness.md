My aunt Edith passed away last week. I try to learn one lesson from each person's life. What I will miss about Aunt Edith is that 

With Mariana sitting next to her lead:
- That she will flirt with him (cheat emotionally) to be in good standing at her job when he advances on her. ::: I'm grateful I have a loyal girlfriend.
- That she won't text me as much because he will be watching her. ::: I'm grateful to be able to text her during work. I'm grateful we both have jobs. I'm grateful we get to focus on work and be productive as unto the Lord.

Her lead watches a lot of Tennis games.
- That she will be more interested in him because he likes sports and I don't. (See [[Lucy Is NIce|90-10 Rule]]) ::: I'm grateful that Mariana chose me and loves me despite my lack of interest in watching sports.
