She is a very genuine and sweet girl with a lot of energy and a great sense of humor. She is more quiet and reserved, but not too much. She likes to laugh, and when she's speaking in Spanish she speaks a lot more, very quickly, because that's her natural language. So she becomes very animated with her friends, but still in a feminine way with her body language. When I bring her to church, she smiles and laughs, and talk to people who talk to her, but she's a lot more reserved than when she's speaking Spanish with her friends.

I can tell that physical affection is important to her. She was ready to have sex before I was, and even though she wanted it, she knew it was against my principles, and she respected that. We ended up having sex anyway, and a lot of it. She's not a wild girl or loose with herself, but I believe sex makes her feel desired and loved, and there's an emotional component to it that I want to give to her.

She travels to Dallas about once a month to visit me, even though it's exhausting, for her it is worth it. She lives in Mexico City, where she moved after graduating from a college in Puebla, and began to work for American Airlines, where she met me (during orientation in Dallas).

We like to shop at Ross Dress For Less and Macy's. Weather for clothes, or for a purse, or just for fun. She also likes to wear sexy lingerie for me, and buys them online to surprise me sometimes. She really likes to feel desired, and to make me happy in that way, but she doesn't like it if I go overboard with saying sexual things too often. Sometimes it turns her on and she loves it, and sometimes it makes her mad. 

We've traveled to Switzerland, Paris, and driven to cities in Texas (Waco alone, and Austin with my family for a Volleyball game). She prefers to have sex alone so she can make noise and not worry about getting caught. We were caught once when we thought nobody was home, and my sister arrived silently. But since I live with my parents, lately we've been doing it in my room with the door locked and the TV on to mask the noise of our movements. We do it softly when people are home.

I make good money and we are looking at buying a house. We won't live together until we're married. It's still against my principles to have sex before marriage, and the last thing I want to do is do it openly, lest it causes anybody else to stumble because of my example.

She gave me a hint recently that she wants the Starbucks 2023 Recycled Core Mint Glass. I looked at the Starbucks in Target and Kroger, but they didn't have it.

We're both 27, and she's about 7 months older than me. She's the most beautiful and humble girl I've ever met. She always puts other people before herself, and she does everything without complaining. We looked around at the cost of health problems, (financial, stress, time), and agreed that we would not let each other get fat, and make it a priority to go to the gym or play sports to get exercise, and eat a generally healthy (but enjoyable) diet. I don't drink any alcohol, and she's been drinking less since she met me. She has never drank any alcohol around me because I asked her not too, and she was okay with it.
