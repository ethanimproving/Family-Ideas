# Learn New Things Together

[Learning something with your partner can be more memorable than any amount of time on Netflix.](https://www.facebook.com/reel/953819642732023?fs=e&s=TIeQ9V&mibextid=0NULKw) most of us do only one thing with our partners, and it’s watching TV. And that is the lowest form of intimacy.

# Your Wife Determines Your Success
The number one deciding factor of a man's success is the woman he chooses to be his wife. [^1]

Don't marry and don't date crazy. The number one influencing factor to a man's success or failure in life is who they choose as a spouse. And if you're one of those guys, like, I'm a "captain save-a-hoe". Don't be a motherfucking "captain save-a-hoe". Because when you get married to this chick, and when you try and start a life with her, she's gonna constantly be this tornado of problems each time you're trying to do something big, and you're gonna realize, I can't start that company, I can't make those millions, I can't transform people's lives. I can't serve humanity, because each time I try, she is taking a massive shit on my life. Find someone that will back you up. Find someone that will say they believe in you. They will advocate for you. And when you do, be so fucking awesome to her that all she wants to do is support you and be your one woman pit crew. And if you can do that, I'm telling you, man, you will force multiply the impact and income that you will make in life.[^2]
