I’m glad it was you and no other. There is no gem that compares with your eyes, no sunshine that compares with your smile, no rain that compares with the serenity of your countenance.

I found you in the arms of another lover, and turned my face away, and my thoughts far removed. Circumstance brought me to you again, and in tragedy I turned my face towards you in comfort.

Though you have been used, you are new. You slept with 5 men and my heart departed. “She is worthless” said the voices. “You are not restrained to her, but all these virgins are yours for the taking.” I would rather be with you and your kind heart than 1000 virgins who speak quickly and close their ears to listen. I would rather spend my life gazing into your thoughtful eyes full of love than stare at the blank face of a virgin. I don’t choose you because you are all I’m left with. I choose you because there is no greater choice to make me as happy as I am with you. I choose you because there is no heart I cherish more than yours, no face I love to look at as much, and no soul I love as deeply. You are a treasure above all the treasures the earth ever produced, worth more than anything I could spend my life to gain. There was never a woman on earth with your tender face, your gentle gaze, your beautiful goodness, your angelic care. They say what they say, and their words are noise in a world of vanity. You are my lover and my life, and I will spend my life loving you.

Let all the thoughts of vanity perish, and my life with you begin. I choose you, and I want no other choice. I love you my beloved, my dear, Mariana.

Father I don’t know what to do. I feel so hurt by her whoredoms. I feel hurt thinking about Ando messaging her, and the excitement she must have had to welcome his fornications. I feel hurt that she lost her virginity at only 17, a child, an age that would be illegal to watch. I’m hurt by that. I feel robbed. I feel discarded. I feel unimportant. I want to be angry instead of hurt, but I recognize that’s a reaction to something more fundamental than that. I’m not really angry. Anger is just a coverup so my heart can feel something besides what it’s feeling now. I feel used. I feel taken advantage of. I feel like she had reckless fun with the bad boys and is settling down with someone stable now. I don't feel that she has the right to believe she is entitled to have me after living that lifestyle. I hate her sometimes because of it.

Instead of feeling victimized I want to say she is impure, and filthy, and worthless so that she can feel there is some kind of consequence for her whoredoms. I want her to feel bad about herself so that she then feels lucky to be with me, like she doesn’t deserve me but I am the grace that she really wants. As it is I feel she thinks of me as simply a stable guy with money to take care of her now that she has finished living recklessly.
