Oh, woe betide, when I awake alone,
Guilt creeps upon me, forlorn and lone,
But with thee by my side, all feels right,
And happiness doth fill me with delight

Oh, how I yearn for thee to be near,
To banish this guilt, this lingering fear,
To wake up with thee, my heart's desire,
And bask in love's warm and gentle fire.

Thou art the light that guides me through the day,
My beacon in the darkness, come what may,
And though we may be parted for a time,
Thou art forever in this heart of mine.

So come, my love, and let us never part,
For waking up with thee is music to my heart.
A blissful state, a wondrous delight,
That fills me with joy, and pure light.

Also it would be nice to fuck you in lingerie.
