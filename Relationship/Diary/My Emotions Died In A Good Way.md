Oddly I'm not thinking about Mariana anymore. If she can come here and prove to me that she can love Jesus, than I'll marry her, but if she's just a normal girl with a kind heart who posts memes with vulgar words, bye bye. 

==Ever since Amy got engaged my emotions died==. In a good way. Not in a paralyzing way. I'm happy. I'm working. I'm active. And I'm not caught up thinking about anyone. I don't want to date Jas. She has bitterness and anger she needs to resolve. I don't want to date Siri. We have nothing in common right now. Maybe later. I don't even want to date Mariana. It's so much work to keep her happy. She really likes it when I speak Spanish to her. And it's emotionally draining when she ignores me for a day. I feel like I'm in her friend zone.

When you talk to someone for too long without asking them out or making it obvious that you would fuck them, you end up in their friend zone. Across borders, flirting doesn't seem fitting, because there's no connection point to make it lead somewhere. So we end up being best friends.

If we had a second meeting, we would have had a first date. But now we won't.

I like Mounika. She talks to me. Throughout the whole week she talks to me, and she never runs out of politeness and flintiness. She's beautiful and lovely.
