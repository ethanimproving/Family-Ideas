Mariana won't be talking to me forever. She's new in the city and hasn't met a lot of guys yet. I'm keeping her happy with herself in the meantime because she still feels good getting attention from somebody. As soon as she meets somebody in Mexico she will get bored of me and ghost me online. I'm ready for that. She's very pretty and always happy. She has a young energy and perfect eyes glimmering in the sunshine as though they were precious jewels. Her smile is like the splash of the waves of God's mercy, and the waves of his grace. The brightness of her kindness never fades away. Her face is exalted to the heavens above us, always cheerful with newborn excitement. The darkness of a thousand sorrows cannot make her downcast, because gravity pulls her in reverse.

She is dark and light in one color-- so beautiful and perfect. I remember her soft lips and gentle teeth, each one with her exact twin. There is a smile of love, and there is a smile of deceit, and there is a smile of smiles, in which these two smiles meet.

Her hair drips like a stream of brown gold covering the honor of her head. It veils her as the beauty of a bride, so clean and pure and ready to find love.

She will be taken soon by another boy that sees the richness of her qualities. Her silence will greet me like an old friend, and I will be left alone. Come, dear friend. I am waiting for you.
