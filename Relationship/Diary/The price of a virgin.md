For all this technology, for every king like pleasure this generation offers, I would trade it for the blessing of virginity. I would go back in time and give up cars and roads and air conditioner for a woman who is mine and mine alone. Mariana is no virgin, and I will never love her as much as I would if she were a virgin. I would see her smile differently. When I imagine her as a virgin, I’m filled with unwavering love without second thought. But with the yoke of her sins I see her as worth less. With her fornications she is not valuable like a virgin is. She is used and wasted. She is not new neither pure. She is the desolate leftovers of other men. She has been used and tossed aside, and is now mine. What a difference it would make if she were a virgin.

I do not love her, so why do I tell her I love her? I love her solely on the basis of who she is, apart from anything she’s done. Her work is not pleasant before me. All her doings are gross and disgusting.

> [!Bible] [Isaiah 57:7-8 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Isaiah+57:7-8?translation=kjv)
> *7. Upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed: even thither wentest thou up to offer sacrifice.
> 8. Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance: for thou hast discovered thyself to another than me, and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made thee a covenant with them; thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest it.*

Why should I take a harlot? Why should I love a daughter of the world who has played the whore? Because I fear that there is no one better. I have met virgins, ugly women that I am not attracted to. The beautiful church girls are taken, and now only 2 remain: ugly church girls and beautiful worldly girls. I should choose the former but it makes me ache. I don’t want an ugly girl. So I found the best of them that are beautiful. Of all the women of the world, Mariana is the purest.

> [!Bible] [Isaiah 62:5 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Isaiah+62:5?translation=kjv)
> *5. For as a young man marrieth a virgin,
so shall thy sons marry thee: and
as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride,
so shall thy God rejoice over thee.*
