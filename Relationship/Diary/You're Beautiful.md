Even if I close my eyes you're a beautiful person. You're not the only girl that I know, but you're the one that I like the most. You are perfect for me because of your personality. You can tease and joke, but you're not unaware of anything.

Your smile is so full of light that it melts away every worry when I see it, and it's a sophisticated smile, not a cheap smile. It isn't a smile for nothing. And if someone got into a car wreck and needed someone to bring them to the hospital, you would be there. And if someone lost a family member and needed someone just to sit quietly with them, you would be there for them in that moment. That's what I see in your eyes. A very deep, sophisticated, strong and rooted love and laughter. You are an angel from God. And it's because your smile is so heavy with layers behind it, I cannot help but love you. I cannot help but see you. I can't ignore what I see. I can't ignore who you are. You're too beautiful to look past, and when I open my eyes your just as beautiful as all the poetry I find beneath.
