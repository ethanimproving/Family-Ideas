John is right. Why am I infatuated with Mariana? She's not a virgin, she doesn't know it was a sin, she drinks, she doesn't want many kids, she thinks divorce is necessary sometimes. There's nothing about any of those beliefs that are acceptable to me. They are all deal breakers, and she has 4 of them! Do I think I can change her mind? Give her pretty face up and start meeting girls locally. Or go back to Jennifer! She wants you back.

She has spent way too much time out of church.

1. Just because she doesn't know fornication is wrong doesn't mean she won't accept what the Bible says.
2. Just because she believes divorce is sometimes necessary doesn't mean she will divorce me.
3. Just because she drinks doesn't mean she'll cheat on me.

I don't love you right now. Because all my life I've worked on making myself more godly so a godly woman would love me, and the very things that make me godly are things you disagree with. Favor is deceitful. And it's the whole reason I like you. I'm going to believe the Bible. You are deceiving me. What's the lie? That you're kind. That you like me. That you aren't just trying to use me to get into America and then divorce me. I hate divorce.

I will visit you. I will go to Mexico and use you to drive me around, and take me to the places I want to visit, and I will turn the tables and manipulate you, and ==I won't ask you to be my girlfriend==.

No, that's the wrong attitude. Someone will marry her, it may as well be me. If she doesn't know these doctrines that were instilled in me for so many years, that means that I need to study, and research, memorize my own sermon for each topic, and learn how to be compelling so that I can change someone's mind. Because I will need to teach my children, so I may as well do the hard work and practice on Mariana. If I haven't changed her mind, I need to meditate more on the scriptures.
