I prayed for a way and you made it. I asked for the Red Sea to be parted, and through pain you parted it. Nick discovered my sins, and Pastor Shelley also. In haste I ran to Mariana with fear, making hasty words to cease from fornication. She agreed. And when fear subsided I returned to my desire, and wished for her again. I asked her to continue in the sin wherein we were caught, and she said no. Father, she is a good woman. A better Christian than me. Her heart is pure, and she wants to do the right thing. I want that life with her. I just feel betrayed. I've heard promises of knowing you my whole life. "It takes time, and self denial, and getting sin out of your life." And after all the sin I've fought, all the courage I needed to go to Stedfast and serve you, and I'm just as distant as ever. I feel like it doesn't work. Their warnings are just words, and their promises also. Where is the promise? 

This thinking is vanity. I will patiently wait for the promise, and I will patiently endure the chastising of the Lord. Only have mercy on me, dear God.

I'm thankful for this woman, God. She has desires. She has urges. And by some miracle she has them for me. And yet in all of my attempts to make her stumble, she stands. She wants to be pure. She wants to wait. She asked, "What do I do with the lingerie I bought for you?" Burn it. Store it away for our marriage. From here on out, we will serve the Lord.
