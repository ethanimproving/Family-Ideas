Every morning the sun greets me, never failing to rise and give it's beautiful sunshine in my world. There is another light, a hidden light, larger than the sun and brighter, but further away so it's beams are concealed. Men dream about it, poets write about it, but I found it in the night as a buried treasure in plain sight, and keep finding it again and again. I touched her blouse like it was a page I wanted to turn. For a second she went transparent, lightheaded, as she fell into my arms by design. I looked into her eyes, brilliant and bright, two brown gemstones more beautiful than any diamond. In that moment I knew that God is an artist, and his masterpiece was right in front of me. Whether a reward for anything good I've done, or grace despite the bad, every inch if her smile convinces me again that life is beautiful.
