Dear Mariana, 

I haven't had the chance to tell you yet, but I like you a lot. You probably already know it, and I hope you like me too. I think you're funny, pretty, kind, sweet, and good-hearted. You have a special sparkle in your eye that makes me trust you, and a glow in your smile that makes me love you. Maybe you didn't know that I love you, and I won't tell you for awhile longer, but I already do. Even before our first date, even before our second meeting, I've already fallen in love with you. It's been 8 months since I accidently found you. I thought you were just a pretty girl. I didn't know that night that I stumbled across the most beautiful jewel buried in the earth.

You haven't become bored of me yet, and that says a lot about you, because I haven't been a bad boy. I haven't made sexual jokes, I haven't used profanity, I haven't said anything negative about anyone, and you're still talking to me. And you clothe your words in purity and innocence, and it makes me love you. You get excited when I'm excited, and you laugh when I'm being silly. You haven't ignored me or ghosted me, but everyday you take care to message me.

Mariana, I like you a lot. Maybe you already knew that. But you don't know that I love you. You are such a high treasure for me, and because I love you I'm going to fight to be pure for you. I know you don't want me looking at other women and lusting after them. I'm tempted a lot right now, but I love you more. Instead of watching that video, I'm writing you a letter. I won't send it to you, but maybe I'll show it to you many years from now.

I hope you're still in my life many years from now. I never thought I would love someone as much as I loved Amy Peavey, but you've made me forget about her. Please wait for me. Please love me too. 

I'll talk to you tomorrow, 

Ethan
