Robert invited us to a church event tonight with a lot off pretty girls. I told him, "You haven't seen the girl I like. She will engulf off all of the prettiness of all those girls with one look. And then give another expression and totally destroy anybody's attention to anyone else. Like at night with all the stars out, and there's a million pretty lights to look at, and then the sun comes out and totally blinds you from all of the stars because of it's glory."
