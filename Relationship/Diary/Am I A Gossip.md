To be honest Lord, she told me one of the reason's she likes talking with me is because I'm fun to gossip with, so I thought to tell her the drama between my extended family and myself. But now I regret it, because I realize everything in her messages were positive, and everything in my 3 messages were negative. My words will be odious to her. She will perceive that my character is lacking, and it will invalidate any warranted negativity I say in the future. If I call the pope a pedophile, or say homos are capable of anything, my judgment is already discredited by saying negative things about my own family. She will think I'm against everything. Forgive me Lord, I've tried to repent from my words, my I keep increasing my folly. I don't know what to say. I can't unsay the stupid things I wish I wouldn't have. Forgive me, Lord. Rescue me from my hasty words. I'm sorry. And further I have grieved the Holy Spirit by speaking evil about my family.

I didn't know if I should correct myself or let Mariana correct me. If I let Mariana correct me, than I can tell her that's why I need her around, and she will feel like she contributes something to me. She is so pure. And it makes me want to be pure like she is. But on the other hand, "Let no corrupt communication come out of your mouth" probably means I have thoughts bound for speech that I need to filter out of my mind before I let it reach another person's ears. And since my message was unread, I thought to delete it. So I sent a message of the verse I remembered saying I hoped she hadn't read my message, but then I was unable to delete it. So now I have 3 follies:

- I was a negative gossip.
- I said I hoped she didn't read a message that I didn't delete, which makes no sense.
- I put a laugh emoji together with the message explaining that my family hates me, making me look insensitive like I don't care.

I used that laugh emoji so that it would look like I don't care that she hates me, but actually it bothers me. I thought maybe Mariana will think I have so many friends from church, and that my real family are the people who believe like me, so that I'm not needy for relationships, and I have the masculine strength to cut people off because my standards are high. And when I go out soul-winning, I meet so many people, so I can pick and choose who I want in my life. Because there are so many options.

I need a better way to phrase this. A short, concise way that I can send to Mariana.

I used a laugh emoji so that it would look like I don't care that she hates me, but actually it bothers me a little. I thought laughing would make it look like I have the masculine power to cut people off because I have other options to pick and choose from, which means she needs to meet my standards for me to love her. But I think I just love her anyway and it makes me upset that I don't know why she stopped liking me...

It makes me look powerful if I can cut people off who don't treat me right. If I continue in a relationship where someone treats me poorly, it makes me look weak and needy, like I'm desperate to be with them. If I leave, it means I have other options. Like, "Hey, I'm not with you because I need to be with you. I'm with you because I chose to be with you, and I can stop choosing at any moment." I think this is one of the reasons people get divorced. It's a pride thing about wanting to feel in control.

Mariana, I'm not the best person you could choose. But I'm willing to make the changes if you're willing to be patient with me and help me along the way.
