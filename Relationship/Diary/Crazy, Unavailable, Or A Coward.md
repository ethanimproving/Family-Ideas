I'm defeated, but not forever. That's my personality. I can already see this new friend of Mariana will ask her out. If he doesn't ask her on a date he is either crazy, unavailable, or a coward. She is head and shoulders above all the other girls. I spotted her immediately at the party I met her in. I didn't care about here then, and there were 40 other girls but ==her beauty was like a spotlight on herself, a queen among the servants==. I thought for sure she was full of herself, but when I talked to her ==she was humble and funny==. She has everything. If there was such a person as a perfect person, with nothing lacking, it would be her. If he doesn't ask her out, he is either crazy, taken, or too shy. What am I?

Remember my friend that I was with at the party?
