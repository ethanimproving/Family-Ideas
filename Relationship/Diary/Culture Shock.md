Mariana is going to experience culture shock when she moves here. To alleviate that, I want to understand what are the pillars of her life in Mexico.

1. Volleyball
2. Accounting
3. Nala
4. Friends / Lety
5. TV

The first thing we need to do when she gets here is find a group for her to play volleyball with. I think that’s really important. I also want to get her involved in a weekly Bible study. What will be her pillars in the US?

1. God
2. Volleyball
3. Nala
4. Bible study group
5. Children
6. Homemaker

I’m just imagining. I don’t want her to make bad quality friends. She should make 0 friends who aren’t Christians. As long as she’s starting over, it makes no sense to gain what God asks you to give up. 

Before she has children we can learn a hobby. She can study nutrition. We can learn advanced dancing. We can go rock climbing. Gym routine. Biking. Learn to cook. There’s so much to learn that would be helpful to me, it would make no sense for her to study in college to get a degree. I won’t need help supporting the family. I can take care, with God’s mercy, of all the financial issues.
