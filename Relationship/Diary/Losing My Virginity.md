I don't want to do it. My desires aren't uncontrollable. I have every inch of the handle gripped. I'm not doing it for me. I'm doing it for her. Not to feed her desires, but because I know it will make her happy. It will make her smile when I pursue her in bed. And if I don't, especially now, especially after everything I said, she will be disappointed. It will be worse than disappointment, because of everything I put in her head. She doesn't know what to expect. But I do. I expect to find a change of clothes in her bags. I expect to find birth control pills and her legs shaved. She doesn't know what will happen, but she's planning for what she hopes will happen. And if I don't give myself to her, if I don't let her give herself to me, it will be hope deferred.

Tomorrow at this time I will still be a virgin. And 4 hours after that I may not be. I'm 25. I've waited my whole life. This is my first opportunity to prove that my abstinence is out of virtue and not lack of capability.

My parents didn't raise me with virtue. They raised me without friends. I'm so happy to look in the mirror and know that I've kept myself. I'm so happy to know that when I judge between right and wrong, I'm not guilty. I love that when people look at me, they know that I'm pure. They see it in my eyes. And now I'm beyond the point of willingness to let Mariana take that innocent glow out of my eyes. I will no longer be happy with myself. I will no longer feel innocent or pure, or fit to serve God. My entire life is in front of me, not behind me. And I'm going to sacrifice the blessing for one single meal. One moment of pleasure.

I don't want to. I'm not ready. There's only one thing that will make me ready. Marriage. I have to wait.

It just kills me to withhold her smile from her. I don't want her. I saw how she smiled when I expressed my intentions for tomorrow. She's ready. She's willing. And she won't allow me because she loves me. She said she will say no for my sake. I told her, "Don't say no," and finally her countenance lifted. She was tired and sickly all day after I spoke all my heart to her. But when I gave her my lascivious desires she renewed her energy and emerged upright and fresh as from a precious sleep. I don't want to withhold that from her. I want make her feel cherished and loved. I want her to feel like I'm crazy about her. Am I willing to sacrifice the last 25 years and the next 45 for her smile?

Ethan Vargas destroyed his vibrance. He used to be something, and now he's a byward. I won't be a man for this. I will be a byward. I will be a desert sucked dry of it's water and life. I will be a dried up well worth nothing. Why destroy myself for her smile? She's willing to change for you and become holy. Why are you electing to become unholy? She's willing to wait. She told you that. She even withstood your advances in her. She is a beautoful person and a brand new Christian, and you need to protect her, not defile her.

I feel like it's too late. Am I too late, Lord? To pray once more and ask for the Comforter to give me strength and wisdom for tomorrow? How do I make her feel loved and still protect her from me?
