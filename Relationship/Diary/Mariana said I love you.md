Yesterday Mariana told me she loves me. We were in bed talking, kissing, smiling. I told her first, "I love you," expecting nothing in return, and she responded for the first time, "I love you." It almost didn't notice as I kissed her again. Her smile and her kisses told me this months before her words did. But when the words sunk into my ears, they felt as if they belong there. It felt true. She does love me, more than anyone else ever has.

I struggle to stop thinking about her past. What she would do with Felipe. She had sex with him while Lety was there. Were they loud? Did she let his body make noises with her body? Did she scream? If yes, than she's willing to do more for Felipe than for me. And if so, than she loves Felipe more than me. Or is that certain? Maybe she loves me more because I don't require her to do what she doesn't want to. This thinking is vain, and worse than vain. It's not only guesswork, it's destructive.
