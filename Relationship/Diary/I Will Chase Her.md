Father, I don't pray that you would unlatch my heart from Mariana. I pray you would latch her heart to mine. She's the one I want now. At first I only talked to her so to make myself higher status among my friends. Paloma and Siri saw me talking to girls and thought I could pick up girls easily. But she's special. As we talked I fell in love with with her way you fall asleep. Slowly, and then all at once. I didn't know that would happen. I couldn't have guessed. I was using her to get to Siri, but now I don't want Siri. I want her. I found a treasure in her eyes that makes Siri look like costume jewelry.

I just want her to love God. I want her to worship you with her whole heart, in spirit and in truth. I want her to weep because of your grace. And I want her to be glad that she's with a guy who fears God and leads her spiritually. Not like Janik who argues with Joss about God, who doesn't believe, but like Joel, who guided his wife Sheena to a life of godliness and service to God. Or Steven Anderson who won his wife to Christ, and gently led her to becoming a model Christian and mother to woman everywhere. These things I pray.

Pull on her heart strings to be saved. She first talked to me, but I have no shame in talking to her first. The world tells me it's against wisdom, but I'm tired of playing games. I'm not going to hide my feelings so that she'll like me. I am what I am, and if who I am repels her, better now than later. I will text her when she's on my mind because I like her. I won't keep score any longer about who texted who first how many times. I'm going to pursue her. And I will chase her the way a 2nd grader chases a girl on the playground. She doesn't have to take a step towards me for every step I take towards her. I'm going after her. And eventually I'll catch her. And if she loves me I'll never let go. And if she doesn't, at least I'll know.
