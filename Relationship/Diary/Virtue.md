“You don’t want to finish?” “No.” “You didn’t want to do that at all, did you?” “Not really. But I don’t have a choice apparently.”

She is a virtuous girl. After we talked she changed her behavior to align with God’s word. Even knowing that we aren’t married and she doesn’t owe it to me, we agreed that we would either be abstinent or follow the pattern of marriage. And ==the pattern of marriage is to render to each other due benevolence==. So this morning she didn’t want to, but ==she rendered to me undue benevolence as a foreshadowing of future obedience to God’s commandment of the marriage duty==.

I know that it’s wrong now, we shouldn’t be doing it at all, but what she gave to me was an act of love. Therefore I will be very careful to show her love with actions when I don’t feel like it. Today at Six Flags I will be very proper and noble. I will not touch her sexually, or make excessively sexual jokes. I will try very hard to be sharp and process her words quickly. And I will avoid talking about things she doesn’t know about and avoid being too geeky. This morning was about me, and the rest of the day is about her.
