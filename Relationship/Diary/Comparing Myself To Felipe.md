A picture. Worth a thousand words, each wrapping a hundred emotions. Mariana doesn't belong with me. Felipe made her happy. I'm not good enough for her. I'm not a leader like he was. I'm not sure of myself like he was. I'm not handsome like he was. I don't have the same focus and vision in my eyes. I'm just a drifter. I'm a con artist smiling my way through the world. I don't speak with authority. I exploit stranger's compassion. I make friends and manipulate them into fighting my battles for me. I'm not good like he is. And she doesn't love me like she loved him, and she never will. I don't make her smile like him. I don't make her laugh like him. What am I?

I'm a homeless beggar asking her to love me. I'm manipulating her to be with me. She doesn't like me. She's with me because I asked her to be. Everybody does what I ask them to do. That's all I am. I'm an asker. And when they say no, I'm persistent. And she'll never love me. I'm a master manipulator and a narcissist. I don't have roots. I don't have core values. I just take and never give. I suck the energy from people until I breach their limits.

I'm not worth it. The best thing God could do is open her eyes to let her realize she doesn't want me. Someone needs to save her from me. It would be good for her and good for me. Good for her because she wouldn't be subjected to my life-draining soul, and good for me because she's the only person I care about. I want her to be happy. I want her to be with Felipe again. Maybe he's out there somewhere. Maybe there's someone else who could make her happy. But never me. I can't even make myself happy.

I'm a loser and a leach. The world is better off if I died. Do them a favor, Ethan. Let them all have peace. Give them all what they want. Leave.

She doesn't need me to prove to her sisters that she has game with guys. She already believes she is the prettiest. She had a boyfriend for years. None of them look down on her for being single. It's not a problem she is looking to solve. There's no place for me in her life. I'm only useful to girls when they need a temporary boyfriend to show their friends that somebody wants them. None of them care about me. None of them search for my feelings or ask about my thoughts. None of them care about me; only themselves.

But Mariana is different. She does care. She cares about everyone. She's truly selfless. She's truly pure. And her kindness moves me in ways I didn't know I could be moved. It feels like a spirit being pulled in my body, goosebumps erecting as I feel the moment pass. She's mesmerizing. I've never seen anyone good like her.

She makes me want to live. But I'm afraid I will corrupt her. Her smile is too full to risk being tainted by my influence. It's better for her to stand at my grave and smile afterwards than to live with my negative mind and be turned into the same creature I already am.

The only gift I can give her is to spare her from my company. The only gift I can give her is to die. So what will you do, Ethan? Do you love her or not?

If you love her, then kill yourself. Give her a chance to be happy. Just take the right amount of the wrong pills. You won't feel it. I promise.

These are not my thoughts. It's a story I tell to make myself feel something. I'm not suicidal. I just like to pretend sometimes. If gives me goosebumps. It makes me feel noble and selfless. I imagine someone reading it and giving me their sympathy. I imagine someone reading it and understanding me. But I'll never kill myself.

Look at her smile. There's not a thing in the world she wants more than what she already has. He makes her so happy. And I'm far too lazy to think about what I will need to do to make her just as happy. She loves being loved. She loves being loved by someone she loves. She's complete in that photo. She isn't waiting for something more. She already has what she wants. Everything she wants. She's happy. I've never seen that before.

I've never seen a girl more beautiful. I've never seen a girl more in love.
