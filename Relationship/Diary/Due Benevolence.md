“Why can’t you just respect a no? No means no. Especially when it has to do with my body.” No that’s toxic. The Bible says you do not own your body, but your husband. You owe me sex not because I payed for dinner or brought you to Disneyland, but because you’re my girlfriend. I have a subconscious feeling that you owe sex to me, and ==if it’s not because you are my girlfriend, we will always see it as an exchange, and that’s toxic==. Than I will say, “What value do you bring to the table?”
