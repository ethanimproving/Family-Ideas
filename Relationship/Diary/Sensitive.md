Dear Mariana,

I promise that when things are bad I will find a way to make things work with you. It’s too late for any other resolution. I can’t separate my soul from yours when the Lord has bound us together. You are mine, for better and for worse. I hope it will mostly be for better, but no matter how bad it gets, I will never leave you. It’s not a thought in my mind, or an option I will ever allow in my thoughts. I love you, and even when we’re mad I can’t unlove you.

I’m difficult to get along with sometimes. The truth is I hate a lot of things about myself. I’m sensitive and I’m bad at taking lighthearted pokes. My receding hairline, my “small chest,” my bad sense of direction, my general lack of street smarts. Sometimes I feel extremely dumb when you pull me around and tell me what to do. Or when you give me that look like, “I can’t believe how stupid you are,” like when I put the remote in with the cable because I didn’t know it retracts. It seems like you think of me as an idiot sometimes. Which hurts very much because as a romantic person I’ve created so many fantasies of being someone strong, smart, majestic, and good. Someone you could love and feel lucky to be with. So when you say those things I feel weak, less than average, and dumb. And that makes me mad which strips away the goodness too. I know it’s meaningless to you, but it isn’t to me. Small things like that put a big scar in how I view myself. Death by paper-cuts.

I take every criticism as a note for something to work on. You’ve talked about my small chest multiple times, and I’ve gone to the gym, I’ve learned how to cook a few things to build muscle. And after all that time you still call it small. And then as I’m still working on that, you talk about how I don’t have a lot of hair. So I bought a $500 helmet to wear for 25 minutes every other day to help with that. And then you said I am slow to process things when the passport agent asked how many days we were staying in Switzerland. And then I rejected your kiss after you told me one last thing that put me over the edge.

I don’t want you to lie to me or hide how you view me. It’s not that you say those things to me. It’s that those things expose the reality of how you view me. I’m like a stupid pet you keep on a leash. I’m not someone you look to for protection, or who makes you feel safe, or that you trust to take care of you, or make smart decisions, or lead the family unit. You don’t even respect me enough to believe I can get around a city. It’s emasculating. I don’t want you to hide it. I just want you not to make those things my identity. “You are slow.” I’d rather you be the woman in my life that builds me into something strong and that you can be proud of.

I need you to be the person who believes in me, who believes that I can change, and who pushes me and encourages me all the way to the finish line. Not the person who reminds me who I “really am” and keeps me stuck there.
