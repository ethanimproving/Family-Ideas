You are beautiful. You are so beautiful. I didn't think anything of you when I first met you. I approached you because I thought you were pretty and I wanted to impress my friends by talking to you. They think I'm the kind of guy that goes on a lot of dates and has a lot of courage with girls, so I try to fit into that frame and keep that perception of me alive. That's the reason I talked to you.

I didn't know you were so precious. I didn't know I was going to talk to you for months after the party. I didn't know you were a rare woman of principles and compassion and kindness in your heart. I didn't know I would look at pictures of you on Facebook and get lost in your eyes trying to figure out what I saw in them. I found purity and innocence, kindness and sweetness, adventure and life, charity and love. Most girls have depression and tiredness, joyless disappointment and lifelessness. Your eyes are so different from them. Your eyes alone make me love you, because I can see your character in them. You aren't just a pretty girl I met at a party. You're more than that to me. ==You're a unicorn in the woods I never knew existed, disguised as the most beautiful woman on earth. I didn't search for you. I thought you were a fairy tale, but the more I know you the more I'm convinced that you have a pure heart==. I did not find you here or there, but inwardly over time. You cannot find this precious jewel lying about ready to be seen. It is a treasure only discovered with patience as the light slowly uncovers the disguise.

Your beauty is strong, but it's vain to me. Even all of it's glory cannot stand against the goodness of your soul. As your beauty fades in time your virtue will increase, and I will love you more powerfully then than I knew I could now. I dream of your tender embrace. I love you.
