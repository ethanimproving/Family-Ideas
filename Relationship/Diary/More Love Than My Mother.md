You are the princess I needed to build my kingdom. You are the strength I needed to climb higher. The mist in the cool of the day that refreshes my soul could not compare with how you heal me when my head is resting in your lap, caressed by your love. Your laughter brings me to life, and your smile awakens my dreams. Your kiss is the kiss of love. Your voice is the chorus of heaven, reminding me how strong I am. I am capable of anything as long as you stand behind me. I will take the stars from the skies and make them into an ornament around your neck. I will build you a home if we build it together.

My mother was a strong woman who loved me beyond the scope of understanding. I needed a woman to love me as strongly as she did, to believe in me as much as she did, and I found you. Your heart was as large as the heavens, and full beauty. You're the only one who could offer me a life better than the one I had to give up to be with you. Now I will give you the world, and more if you ask. You are my beautiful queen, full of virtue and grace. I see in your eyes a depth I've never explored in 1,000 faces, and a simplicity that is only achieved after much struggling to the top of a mountain. The purity in your eyes is a jewel never obtained by any other daughter. I fell completely in love with you, with one dream and one wish, and by God's grace you fell into my arms.
