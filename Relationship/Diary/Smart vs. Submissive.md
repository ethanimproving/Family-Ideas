 You don't have to be smart to be successful. If you listen to someone else who is smart, your life will end up really well.

And there's no one smarter than God. I would rather have a wife who is submissive than a wife who is smart.

Sarah is smart, already seeking God, and the perfect blend between submissive and challenging.

Here's the problem: I don't love her. She doesn't brighten my day when I see her smile.

Mariana isn't as smart, and she isn't as challenging, and she doesn't respect me as much. She disobeys what she knows is right. She doesn't have a lot of thoughts when she disagrees, so it's hard to pin point what the problem is. She's more work, she's more difficult, and I absolutely love her and would sacrifice anything for her. I have no hesitation choosing Mariana. She's the one I want. She's the one my heart stirs me up over. Who says I have to pick the smartest? Charm is deceitful. I trust her heart, she cares about people, she has bright and young energy, and there's no one on the planet that has what she has in her eyes. It's not the color that is so mesmerizing. It's the essence of her attitude, her emotions, her soul that are all captured in the most complicated yet simple expression of her eyes. I can't unlove her, I can't look elsewhere, and no matter how smart another woman is, no woman has Mariana's soul. That's what I'm in love with. Her innocent and pure love for the world. Her goodness. Her transparency. Her calmness. Her meekness.

> 22. The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.

A single eye. A single vision. A single consideration. Not waffling back and forth between what she should do. Every other pair of eyes in the world are double-eyed. They consider others, and they consider themselves. Not Mariana. She sees a need and she steps in and fills it, and she doesn't think about the cost to herself. She's not lazy. She thinks about others without conflict. This quality alone makes her irresistible to me.

> 3. Let nothing
be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.

We've argued, but we've never argued over vainglory. She puts others first. She thinks about you before she thinks about herself. Who else does that?

> [!Bible] [Proverbs 17:9 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Proverbs+17:9?translation=kjv)
> *9. He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends.*

She tells me when I do something that makes her mad, but one thing she has never done is brought up something from the past. Never once has she repeated an issue that we already talked about. She gets things resolved, forgets they happened, and lets things go. What a beautiful trait in this woman. And the Bible says that it means she's seeking love. She's not out here to pick me apart, or to tear me down, or to prove something. She's here to build me up, and make me better, and win in the sight of God instead of winning an argument.

> [!Bible] [Proverbs 17:14 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Proverbs+17:14?translation=kjv)
> 14. The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water: therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.

One thing I've noticed is that she is very longsuffering. She doesn't get triggered to argue over every little thing. She avoids unnecessary fighting. She isn't defensive, she doesn't take things personally, and she handles correction like a champion. I don't deserve her.

> [!Bible] [Proverbs 17:27-28 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Proverbs+17:27-28?translation=kjv)
> 27. He that hath knowledge spareth his words:
and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit.
> 28. Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise:
and he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.


> [!Bible] [Proverbs 29:11 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Proverbs+29:11?translation=kjv)
> 11. A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise
man keepeth it in till afterwards.

> [!Bible] [Ecclesiastes 5:3 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Ecclesiastes+5:3?translation=kjv)
> 3. For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a foolâ€™s voice
is known by multitude of words.

The very thing that made me think Sarah is smarter than Mariana, the Bible actually says is an indication that Mariana has more knowledge than Sarah.

> [!Bible] [Proverbs 18:8 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Proverbs+18:8?translation=kjv)
> 8. The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.

Mariana always believes the best in people. She doesn't go around spreading rumors, or damaging people's reputation for her own personal entertainment. She is the most uplifting positive person I know.

> [!Bible] [Proverbs 25:28 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Proverbs+25:28?translation=kjv)
> 28. He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like  a city that is broken down, and without walls.

Knowing when to say no to your temptations and urges. These are usually reactions, outbursts that we didn't plan or premeditate. Mariana has a very tight grip on herself. She doesn't do things unintentionally. She doesn't react without thinking first. And that makes her like an impenetrable fortress. Nobody is going to make her do anything she hasn't decided to do, with all of their efforts, with their stray comments or trolling insults, they don't even make it into her inner mind. She's stable. Another very important quality that I love about her.

> [!Bible] [Proverbs 26:23 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Proverbs+26:23?translation=kjv)
> 23. Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered with silver dross.

When you just can't wait to say something. Your lips are burning with the desire to speak that you don't listen to the person talking. Mariana's not like that. Beneath her silver exterior is even more precious gold.

> [!Bible] [Ecclesiastes 7:5 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Ecclesiastes+7:5?translation=kjv)
> 5. It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.

I have to give Mariana so much credit in this area. It's hard to date someone like me. I don't put up with a lot. I am full of rebukes from scripture, I tell her when she does something wrong, I don't sugarcoat what I say, and she told me she respects my beliefs and tries to change her actions because she believes what I taught was right. She could easily trade me for a boyfriend who will sing her the song of fools and never quote her a Bible verse in her life. But she stays with me. Why? The only answer has to be because she prefers to become a better person than to stay in the same place singing the song of fools. Don't think that she isn't seeking. By choosing to be with me, it shows she is seeking.

If I went through all of my favorite verses and evaluated Mariana against everything that I believe in and value, there would be no end to my praises for her. She is full of wisdom and virtue, and against these qualities I cannot convince myself to choose another woman for anything less. My heart is only hers, and I can't choose to stop loving what I love. I love the way we talk. I even love the way we argue. She is my perfect sparring partner, and my perfect partner in every other way. I choose her, and no turning back. I choose her forever. I choose her without hesitation.
