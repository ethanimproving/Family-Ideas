When a guy offers your girlfriend help, there's no need to get jealous. If he's doing it to be friendly, great. If he's going it with intentions to steal her, nothing is going to come to fruition. Helping Mariana setup screen monitors is the exact kind of thing Dustin would do for Bri or Carol or Kritika or anyone. Not all guys are out there to steal your woman. We are problem solvers, and we like to be helpful.

The main difference that I'm feeling right now is that even if he had an intention with my girlfriend, it doesn't matter because she loves me. He can't compete with me. His small gestures won't steal her heart like a frog in water, because Mariana loves me. She never told me that before. I didn't know that's why I was jealous, but I guess it was. Because I don't feel threatened by other guys anymore. If someone wants to give her 1 million dollars, please do it, and she and I will share it. It's not going to make a difference in the way she feels about me.

A lot of my fear was rooted in the doctor from Fireproof. Little by little, and slowly he gained the wife's affection simply by paying attention to her, and saying nice things. I guess my fear is that there's a "doctor" at Mariana's workplace trying to do the same thing. But not all guys who do nice things are trying to play a game with your girlfriend. And that doctor's efforts didn't matter after she learned that her husband gave up his boat money for her mom. The key to avoid being jealous is to take care of your woman and keep your relationship healthy, because the full soul loatheth an honeycomb, and if she loves me, then I can trust her.
