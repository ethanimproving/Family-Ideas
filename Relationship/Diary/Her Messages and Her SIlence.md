Father, I've sinned. Forgive me. Cleanse me. Correct me.

Here we are again. Here I am again, but you're always with me. The last time Mariana didn't text me over the weekend it was because she had a boyfriend. Not only did she have a boyfriend, but she was living with him. Not only was she living with him, but he made her happy. I could see it in her smile. It hasn't been the same since he died. She never told me about him. She hid him from me, and ignored me on the weekends. And now she's ignoring me again. She knows I'm sick. She knows I'm bored. She doesn't care for me. She doesn't deserve me.

She's not the one. I want her to be. I'm in love with her smile. Her messages brighten my days, but her silence destroys my night. She's beautiful. But Jennifer is beautiful.

God, wake me up. I can't talk to her. Not about anything important. I don't even know of she's left or right. We speak different languages. Her eyes were dead in that one video. I miss her. I want her. I'm in love with her.

I don't know if I'm comfortable with her. I just know I'm dead without her. I'm undone. But if Abraham can have a life without Isaac, than I can have a life without Mariana. My entire life already is without her. I've only met her once. How can somebody have such a profound impact on me with only her words? With only a few pictures?
