What is it that causes people to be interested in the things of God? It's amazing to me how much your upbringing influences this. It's very hard to take someone from zero Christian influence in their life to passionate about God. But it does happen, and I'm curious how to reproduce that in the people we win the Christ. How to I incite growth in their life?

One of the things I wanted to do with Mariana is learn how to foster a love for God in new believers. How to we take them from zero to desiring God more than anything else? If I can't figure that out with Mariana, than I probably won't figure it out at all. I want to crack the code and learn what motivates people to seek God and develop a hunger for him.

This is [[Relationship Tips#Your Wife Determines Your Success|Captain Save A Hoe]] mentality, wanting to take a worldly girl and turn her into a traditional, God-fearing wife. But there are also benefits to it. You will learn things from Mariana that you would never have learned from a church girl, because her challenges will force you to think, and once you have a model for understanding the issue, that enables you to communicate to other people that are at her same level. You will learn patience, and it forces you to figure out [[Sincere Milk|how to minister to new believers]].

# Pray Together

I was having a conversation with my sister about the challenges I was having in discipling Mariana. I expressed that my mission is for her to desire God more than she desires anything else. That she would develop a hunger for him, and take pleasure from being in his presence, drawing near in the Word and in prayer.

I realize that [[Men Are Motivated By Challenge, Women Are Motivated By Praise|women are motivated by praise]], and [[2023-05-13|words are some of the most powerful forces in our lives]], so I've been focusing on drawing attention to the ways that I've seen her develop in her Christian walk. I've seen her mostly give up alcohol, she prays with me before meals, she comes to church with me every time she's in town, and she understands that God works everything for good to them that are saved, and she brings that up when things are going bad. She prays to God when she's super stressed. She's mostly onboard with the idea that men take the leadership role in the relationship, which includes a large degree of authority. She quoted Proverbs 31 to her friend Mara when Mara was saying the Bible degrades women and treats them as sex objects. She agreed to read her Bible every day.

Pastor Shelley mentioned in his sermon that mothers have a way of taking everything they notice about their children and spinning it in a positive light. "You are really stubborn, maybe God wants to make you into a Stedfast Christian." "You really like war. God is going to make you a warrior for him." I need to do that with Mariana. "You've been with 5 guys. Maybe God wants to use you to reach people that you can relate with. Maybe God wants to use you like the woman at the well who turned around and got other people in her community saved." "You overwhelm yourself trying to make people happy. God will use you to be a servant to others." See the best in her, and spin everything in a positive way.

That said, it's hard to move from, "I'm so proud of the way you've been coming to church and reading your Bible," to "I want you to love God more than anything else." You can't praise her into something she's not already doing to some degree. But does she have any love for God? Focus on that. Persuade her. When she says she doesn't, say, "Who did you go to when your car keys were stolen?" God. You seek comfort in God. You go to him. You do love him. And your love for him will grow.

When I do that, when I say that she's a godly Christian girlfriend, she will say, "I don't feel like that." To the point where she got frustrated, "I feel like you think of me as something I'm not." So you can't force a self fulfilling prophesy. You have to convince them of who they are, not merely speak it into existence. Words are powerful, but not baseless words. Not words without support or conviction. You have to pay attention, not just speak a vision and say it's already a reality in hopes that she'll live that out.

In the course of the conversation, I asked Anna how she would go about praising her, and she gave me really good advice. She said, "Do you pray together?" And it dawned on me that I don't pray with her. She said, "At the end when you pray together, thank God for the things you've noticed, and pray over her." It sparked my memory of how men have prayed over me. Blanchard, Dan, men at Vida Nueva. It was so powerful to have a man lay his hands on my and pray from the heart. It stirred my heart. And it's a powerful tool we have. The power of God. Don't waste that access to the throne. God wants you to use it.

# End Times

I believe that learning about [[One World Government|end times]] can springboard baby Christians into having a passion for Christ because it makes the Bible come to life. You're able to observe the world around you and say, "Wow! The world is going in the direction God said it would 2,000 years ago!"

It also [[The Overview Effect#How To Get People To Join Your Cult?|brings a state of urgency]] to us because we only have so much time before the end comes. When we live with the belief that Jesus will return before I reach retirement, that puts a huge shift in the way I prioritize God in my life. It makes it easier to sacrifice the things of the world for the things of God. Because after all, all the wealth I'm storing in a barn for retirement is going to perish before I have a chance to enjoy it. I may as well serve God.

Learning about the end times can be an exciting and motivating experience for new believers. It can stir up a sense of urgency to pursue God and live a life pleasing to Him. The Bible is clear that Jesus will return one day, and as we see the signs of the times around us, it can be a reminder that we need to be ready for His return.

End times prophecy can also provide hope for believers in difficult times. It reminds us that no matter how bad things may seem, God is in control and has a plan for our future. This hope can give us strength to persevere through trials and challenges.

Additionally, studying end times prophecy can deepen our understanding of God's character and His ultimate plan for redemption. It can give us a greater appreciation for the sacrifice Jesus made on the cross and motivate us to share the gospel with others so they too can be saved before it's too late.

In conclusion, learning about end times prophecy is not only exciting but also beneficial for new believers. It stirs up urgency and hope while deepening our understanding of God's character and plan for redemption. Let us pursue God with fervor as we await His return.

# Apologetics

The thing that really got me interested in God was my aunt Pat mentioning the technology they had before the flood. I looked into it and found [Billy Crone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vZd2PtILok&list=PLNIf9z4D1dDOhW51bcOqZDGxOJdYoo5R-).

# Blanchard's Class

There were also men in my life that challenged me. And they had a proud look in their eye when I would have a thoughtful question, and that motivated me to seek it more. Being proud of someone can really help them grow.

# Evangelism

I had a really strong desire to get other people saved. I'm not sure where that came from. Maybe AJ, maybe George, maybe Ray Comfort.
