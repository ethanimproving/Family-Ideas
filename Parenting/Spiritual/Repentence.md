The underlying Greek word for repentance is metanoia. It's a compound of two words, meta (to act on itself), and nos (which means mind, just like paranoia ). Metadata is data about about. If you have a scrub brush that's meant to clean another scrub brush, it would be a meta-brush. Metanoia (a meta-mind) is a mind that is evaluation its own thoughts. It is the highest level of Maslow's hierarchy, which is being self aware.
