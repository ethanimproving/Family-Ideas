# Video Game Inspiration

When playing Jedi Academy, at the end of every level there is a list of force abilities and you get to choose to level up one of them. Force Lightning, Force Jump, Speed, Blaster Deflection. It was exciting to become a stronger and stronger Jedi throughout the game.

[[Knights Of The Old Republic II|Knights of the Old Republic]] had a similar level up screen for Skills, Powers, and Feats.

In a similar way I would like to create a list of skills for myself to learn. With Obsidian as the storehouse of my knowledge, it will be easy to organize my education as I go along. I will create a digital pin board of [merit badges](https://www.scouting.org/skills/merit-badges/all/). But this will not be a binary badging system where you have the badge or you don't. There are levels of the badge. I can have "Locksmith" badge for knowing how to take apart a locking cylinder and rekey it without the original key, but that doesn't mean I know how to pick locks. So it would be inaccurate to say I know nothing about it, and it would be inaccurate to say I have mastered it. There must be levels assigned to the badge just like in KOTOR (the greatest video game known to man).
