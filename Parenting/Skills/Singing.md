Singing can also help to boost our immune function, respiratory function. It enables the brain to regulate heart rate, blood pressure, digestion, and may even counter depression.
​
Singing has greatly declined in public life, and one of the reasons is that the arrival of recorded music, radio, and then television meant people no longer had to produce their own musical entertainment, whether alone or communally. Another reason is that we tend to think we’re just not good enough, and only a few people feel confident singing in front of anyone.

> We’ve lifted singing into an almost ethereal art form, one beyond the reach of most mortals. We say, ‘Oh, I can’t sing,’ as if it were a medical condition, a fixed state. ~ Tom Vanderbilt


People often don’t sing as accurately when singing along to recorded music, research has shown, precisely because they don’t have to. Someone else is picking up the slack, technical limitations are covered up. But when your voice alone does the singing, you feel as if you were now out there, exposed and emotionally vulnerable.
​
We tend to overlook the fact that singing is primarily a motor skill. It’s a matter of coordinating muscles to achieve the desired outcome.

# Vocal Health

The best Vocal Training app I've found on the market today is [Yousicion](https://yousician.com/lp/yousician-us). It is $140 for one year (much less than hiring a personal voice teacher, thanks to the [[Technology (Digital Revolution)|digital revolution]] making it possible to scale information limitlessly). Here are some vocal health exercises to keep you from straining your voice.

## Sirening

## Water Bottle And Straw

## Sirening With Hmm

## Lip Drill

## Sirening With "You"

## Sirening With Zzz

## Relaxing The Tongue

# Solid Sound

A solid sound is when no air is leaking out of your vocal cords. The opposite of a solid sound is a breathy sound.

Inner hearing is our ability to imagine sounds and music in our head.

# Breathing for Singing

The air coming out of our lungs is what makes our vocal cords vibrate. We want to keep the airflow steady.

## Upper Chest

Breathing only through your upper chest causes your throat and neck to lock up.

## Too Much Air

If you inhale too much air you get exhausted. This will cause too much air pressure.

## Best Way to Breath

Let go of any extra effort. Let the body do what it naturally does. Stand up, keep your back straight, and relax your shoulders. Open up your chest and try to have an open feeling all over your torso. 

Imagine the air flows right past your chest to your belly, sides, and back, so your upper chest won't even move that much. **Your belly should expand**.

## Quick Breathing

### Happy Surprise

When you meet a friend you haven't seen in awhile and you weren't expecting you, you naturally quickly breath it before explaining, "Hi!"
