The best Vocal Training app I've found on the market today is [Yousicion](https://yousician.com/lp/yousician-us). It is $140 for one year (much less than hiring a personal voice teacher, thanks to the [[Technology (Digital Revoution)|digital revolution]] making it possible to scale information limitlessly).

## Sirening With "You"

## Sirening With Zzz

## Relaxing The Tongue
