# Suit Repair

1. Trim away loose edges from garment to chop up a replacement fluff powder.
2. Mix the fluff with [Fuse-it Powder](https://www.amazon.com/Bo-Nash-2-Ounce-Fusible-Bonding-Agent/dp/B000W5JQKI/ref=sr_1_2?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.HGwZe5gOwK4vEosT15uBnAWHLsTsgyG_5iBZhapR6A931trBNwNpUV8nDGGDEmj6o64-sgyO7pCEk_o6QV2jgZiVn6s0R0tHP5klRWKVt7c.b3-ShHkuzFLjQInldBbdeqzlGvuMy8dt-aMkosM7NwM&dib_tag=se&keywords=Bo-Nash%2BFuse%2BIt%2BPowder&s=arts-crafts&sr=1-2&th=1).
3. Apply fluff into the whole and add more fuse-it powder.
4. Add a small patch to the wrong side to support the new threads.
5. Apply the patch with an iron on the maximum cotton-linin and a fiberglass sheet to protect the fabric.

Put clothes away cleaned and you have fewer issues. The grubs like to eat the human oils we leave on clothing. A hanging garment bag is also a good solution for this. Cedar cubes in drawers also repel them.
