A big problem in our society today is that ==most people think that they already have goals. But what they really have are hopes and wishes==. Unfortunately, neither hope nor wish is a strategy for success. In fact, wish has been defined as a goal with no energy behind it.

If you have a clear goal and a plan to achieve it, you have a track to run on every single day. You won't get sidetracked by distractions and diversions, or go astray. More and more of your time will be focused in a straight line — from where you are to where you want to be.

> The Law of Control states that you feel happy to the degree to which you feel you control your own life. ~ Brian Tracy

Psychologists call this your “**locus of control**.“ Basically, you start to feel unhappy and stressed when you feel controlled by outside circumstances. Therefore, a distinction can be made between your internal locus of control (happy) and your external locus of control (unhappy).

You have an internal locus of control when you feel that you are in charge, you make your own decisions, and what happens to you in life is largely determined by yourself. When you have an internal locus of control, you feel that you are the determiner of almost everything that happens to you. And in effect, you feel strong, purposeful, and happy.

The area in your life where self – discipline is most important is your practices regarding your health.

Exercising regularly is also essential to living a healthy and long life. And as far as longevity is concerned, aerobic exercise is the most important exercise. This requires that you increase your heart rate for thirty to sixty minutes three times per week. You can achieve this through brisk walking, running, cycling, swimming, or cross-country skiing.

No matter how busy you are, try as much as possible to get 8 hours of sleep per night. ~ Brian Tracy
