> We are prone to overestimate how much we understand about the world and to underestimate the role of chance in events. ~ Daniel Kahneman

> Experiments and facts shape the way you think, and this is why you should know when to switch between intuition and empirical facts. ~ Daniel Kahneman

# Intuition vs. Empirical Facts

Humans place value on something because of what anchors the number associated with it. Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman both invented a fortune wheel that was rigged to stop at 10 or 65. They then gathered students of the University of Oregon as participants for their experiment. After spinning the wheel which had been rigged to stop at either 10 or 65, the participants were asked two questions.
- “Is the percentage of African in the UN larger or smaller than the number you just wrote?”
- “What is your best guess of the percentage of African nations in the UN?” 

Although the number on the wheel holds no significance to the question (even if the wheel wasn’t rigged), the participants still based their results on the questions on the number on the wheel.

The anchor for their number was determined mostly by the number they got from the wheel. Those who had 10 chose lesser numbers for the African nations, and those who had 65 chose higher numbers.

## How Insurance Companies Trick You

The ease with which you can come up with examples is often used to determine the frequency of events. Immediately an example comes to mind, your brain pieces together instances of a similar occurrence, and you’re then tricked into believing that such a situation is frequent .

A dramatic event temporarily increases the availability of its category. A train wreck that attracts media coverage will temporarily alter your feelings about traveling by rail. Your mind’s made to believe that the train wreck is a frequent occurrence, and this alters the way you view traveling on a train.
