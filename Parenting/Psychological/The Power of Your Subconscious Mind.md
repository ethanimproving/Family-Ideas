Your subconscious started your heartbeat, controls the circulation of your blood, and regulates your digestion, assimilation, and elimination. When you eat a piece of bread, your subconscious mind transmutes it into tissue, muscle, bone, and blood. This process is beyond the ken of the wisest man who walks the earth.

Your eyes, ears, and other ==senses are active during sleep==. For instance, many of our great scientists have received answers to perplexing problems while they were asleep. They saw the answers in a dream.
  
Unless there is first an image in mind, it cannot move, for there would be nothing for it to move toward. Your prayer, which is your mental act, must be accepted as an image in your mind before the power from your subconscious will play upon it and make it productive. You must reach a point of acceptance in your mind, an unqualified and undisputed state of agreement.

Assume a comfortable posture, relax your body, and be still. Get into a sleepy state, and in that sleepy state, say quietly, over and over again like a lullaby, “I am completely free from this habit; harmony and peace of mind reign supreme.” Repeat the above slowly, quietly, and lovingly for five or ten minutes each night and morning. Each time you repeat the words, the emotional value becomes greater. When the urge comes to repeat the negative habit, repeat the above formula out loud to yourself. By this means you induce the subconscious to accept the idea, and healing follows.


# Talk to your subconscious mind and say:

- “I am now attracting a man into my experience who is honest, sincere, loyal, faithful, peaceful, happy, and prosperous. These qualities, which I admire, are sinking down into my subconscious mind now. As I dwell upon these characteristics, they become a part of me and are embodied subconsciously.”
- “I know there is an irresistible law of attraction and that I attract to me a man according to my subconscious belief. I attract that which I feel to be true in my subconscious mind.”
- “I know I can contribute to his peace and happiness. He loves my ideas, and I love his ideas. He does not want to make me over; neither do I want to make him over. There is mutual love, freedom, and respect.”
