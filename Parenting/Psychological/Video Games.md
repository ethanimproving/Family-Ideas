Dopamine is a one, pain is a zero. The way your brain works is it operates in ones and zeros. And when your brain gets a 1 it's going to look at how hard it was to get that one primarily based around how much pain it took to get there. And your brain desperately wants to avoid pain and it wants to get ones as easily as possible. When you're playing a video game you are able to get ones in an insane amount. You're able to get so many
dopamine hits pow pow pow pow pow.[^1]

The release of dopamine is influenced by various factors such as the intensity of the stimulus, individual differences, and frequency of exposure. For instance, in response to novel or intense stimuli, dopamine release may be more significant and prolonged than in response to familiar or less intense stimuli.

It's important to remember that dopamine is just one aspect of brain chemistry and that factors such as serotonin, oxytocin, and endorphins also play a role in our mood and overall sense of well-being. Ultimately, the best way to support your brain's reward system and overall health is to engage in healthy habits such as **regular exercise, a balanced diet, and good sleep hygiene**.

Getting into cold water significantly increases dopamine levels in a way that doesn't cause a crash.[^4]
