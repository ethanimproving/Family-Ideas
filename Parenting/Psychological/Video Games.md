> *There is single handedly no hobby or side thing you can do that will probably be more damaging to you being successful than playing video games. I'm gonna tell you why in this video so just listen up. ~ Alex Becker*

Dopamine is a one, pain is a zero. The way your brain works is it operates in ones and zeros. And when your brain gets a 1 it's going to look at how hard it was to get that one
primarily based around how much pain it took to get there. And your brain desperately wants to avoid pain and it wants to get ones as easily as possible. When you're playing a video game you are able to get ones in an insane amount. You're able to get so many
dopamine hits pow pow pow pow pow.[^1]
