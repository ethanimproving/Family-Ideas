Overthinking means those times when we lavish mental energy on things that don’t deserve it. Those times when we can’t seem to think about anything else, even though we know our thoughts are better spent elsewhere.  

Needing to choose between two good options can lead to overthinking — take action in order to move forward 

We think moving slowly will help us, but we can spend so much time considering our options that we get stuck in analysis paralysis. We need to remember that “important doesn’t necessarily require slow” every step of the way. There comes a time when a decision doesn’t need any more thought — and past this point, we’re overthinking it.

==Each decision we make throughout the day takes a toll on our finite amount of mental energy== — what to have for breakfast, which route to take to work, how to handle a tricky conversation, whether to buy new jeans before the sale ends, how our child will get home from practice on Friday. Each small decision requires only a bit of brain power, but the cumulative effect is large.[^1]

> Schedule focus, not time. ~ [[Focus and Mental Energy]]

Decision fatigue is sneaky. Instead of feeling specifically tired in a certain way, we feel overwhelmed.

> To avoid decision fatigue, it helps to think of our mental energy as we would a budget — or more aptly, a per diem. We can’t make decision after decision without paying a price.

>The more decisions we make in a day, the worse the quality of our decisions will be over time. ~ Anne Bogel

# Eat the same thing.

It’s remarkable how many decisions we face every day about food. Food and mealtimes play a huge role in our rhythms of life, so when we streamline these things, we save big.

# Adopt a signature dish.

This a reliable recipe you’re always prepared to make for friends. That way, you don’t have to spend your mental energy deciding what to serve, and you don’t have to worry about choosing or executing a new recipe when guests come over. Instead, you can fall into your regular routine — at least as far as the food is concerned — and focus on your friends.

# Limit yourself to one time.

If you find yourself constantly thinking about how to fit something into your schedule or when to fit it in, limiting your options by establishing a set time can help. Committing to a set time is hard for some people, but once that time is set, you don’t have to think about it anymore.
