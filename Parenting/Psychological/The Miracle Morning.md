The problem is always deeper than just getting another 15 minutes of sleep. The life you are living might not be the one you want. Therefore, your subconscious sees no point in letting you torture yourself. When you postpone getting up until you have to — meaning you wait until the last possible moment to get out of bed and start your day — what you are actually doing is resisting your life. Why wake up to something meaningless?

# 5 Steps

## Step 1: Set your intentions before bed

Think of several pleasant things you are planning to do the next day. We usually wake up with the same thought we went to bed with. However, please do not dwell on your plans for too long because you’ll find it harder to fall asleep.

## Step 2: Move your alarm far from your bed

This is the best trick you can play on yourself. When your alarm starts ringing far across the room, you will have to get up to turn it off. You will not be likely to return to bed, as your energy already started flowing through your body.

## Step 3: Brush your teeth

You need to find one useful activity that does not require mindful concentration. You can brush your teeth, stretch, or start making your bed. This will give you time to wake up. Most importantly, don’t pick up your phone to scroll through social media. It will only make your brain agitated, leaving your body still asleep.

## Step 4: Drink a glass of water in its entirety

Water, water, and water again! Drink a glass of water, room temperature. Not in one gulp, of course. Water hydrates you, and you need that because the lack of it in your body causes fatigue and headache. Moreover, it helps your stomach wake up, and that buddy has the potential to have your entire organism up and running.

## Step 5: Get dressed in your workout clothes

Clothes we wear project a particular image not only for others but for us as well. When you put on your sweatshirt and sweatpants, grab your running shoes, you have no other way than to go ahead and start your workout. The author suggests that instead of a shower, you can break a sweat.

Morning exercise should be regular in your daily rituals. When you exercise every morning, your energy levels rise significantly and, having more strength; you will feel more confident about yourself. We tend to believe that the less we move, the more energy we save. This doesn't seem right. Using our power to exercise even for just 1 minute will have our blood rush through the body filling the cells with oxygen.
# Don't Sit On Your Bed

**Make sure you don’t sit on the bed. Its function is to make you fall asleep**. That is not what we are looking for. *Sit up* with your back straight, in a comfortable position. Close your eyes, take a deep breath, and prepare yourself.

# Read A Book For 15-30 Minutes Every Day

**Reading is the practice of self-discipline** and a workout for your brain. You should read both fiction and non-fiction books, as both of these kinds convey human experience in a slightly different way. You can learn from other people without needing to live through some unpleasant situations yourself.

The author suggests that you read for 15-30 minutes every day.

Reading should always have a purpose other than just reading. Before starting to work on a new book, try to **anticipate what you expect to gain from it**. It would help if you chose the books you want to read instead of the books you are supposed to read. Life is too short to be reading something you hate.

# Keep A Journal

Make sure you have a place to keep it comfortably, so that people you live with don’t have direct access to it. The point of the journal is that it gives you space to be absolutely honest and vulnerable. Therefore, you need to feel safe in this space.
