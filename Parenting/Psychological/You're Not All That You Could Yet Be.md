Francis Chan said in a sermon, "One surefire way to be depressed is to look at yourself."

# Narcissism Leads To Suicide

Charlie Kirk visited a church for a talk and said the following:

> You're angry at the divine, that's what's really going on here. And again I will say narcissism. The most narcissistic generation in all of history is also the most suicidal generation in all of history. Because they're thinking about themselves all the time. "I'm not happy. I'm not this." Yeah, it leads to people killing themselves in record numbers. Suicide is a real thing. Ever think that we're telling young people they are the most important person ever actually leads to self harm? It's counterintuitive isn't it? Self esteem is one of the worst things we started teaching in our schools. There was a psychologist who recently got the opportunity to talk to dozens of school shooters. He said every single one of these shooters does not have a guilt problem. He said they're all narcissists. The people that are committing the worst crimes imaginable are the furthest most radical extension of the self-esteem movement. ~ [Charlie Kirk](https://www.facebook.com/reel/1245044626192897)
# There is an Arabic saying and it goes like this

#suicide #depression
> You want to die? Then throw yourself into the sea and youâ€™ll see yourself fighting to survive. You do not want to kill yourself. You want to kill something inside of you. ~ [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/reel/226328199970829)
