Psychologists Sheena Iyengar and Mark Lepper published a remarkable study. On one day, shoppers at an upscale food market saw a display table with 24 varieties of gourmet jam. Those who sampled the spreads received a coupon for $1 off any jam. On another day, shoppers saw a similar table, except that only six varieties of the jam were on display. The large display attracted more interest than the small one. But when the time came to purchase, <mark class="hltr-yellow">people who saw the large display were one-tenth as likely to buy as people who saw the small display</mark>.

[Fixed, Variable, and Marginal Cost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBQVaRnHqLs)

Khan Academy released a lesson called [Fixed, Variable, and Marginal Cost](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/ap-microeconomics/production-cost-and-the-perfect-competition-model-temporary/short-run-production-costs/v/fixed-variable-and-marginal-cost) that illustrates the point of negative marginal costs that occur when you have too many programmers working on the same project. As we spend more money, we're actually killing lines of code. 

>"The more people you add on to a project, obviously they can maybe do more work, but there's also more coordination. There's going to be more meetings. There's going to be more interruptions. And so each person's individual productivity is going to go down... they have to spend some of their energies now coordinating it." ~ [Khan Academy](https://youtu.be/bBQVaRnHqLs?t=456)
