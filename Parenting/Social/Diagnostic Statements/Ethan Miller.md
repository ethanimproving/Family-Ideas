# Strength Finders

At my first consulting company they had me take Gallup's Strength Finders, and my number two strength was "Activator."

## Activator
### Shared Theme Description
People who are especially talented in the Activator theme can make things happen by **turning thoughts into action**. They are often impatient.

### Your Personalized Strengths Insights

What makes you stand out?

#### You get things started

By nature, you excel at launching new projects, assignments, jobs, and other activities. Many times, **you are the person who motivates people to begin tasks**. You prefer difficult-to-reach goals. You prefer to take charge. **You forge ahead rather than wait for someone in authority to give you permission to start**.

#### People rarely question you

Instinctively, you probably stimulate individuals to be more enthusiastic about what they are doing. How? You repeatedly remind them that you truly value their contributions, talents, experience, and expertise. It’s very likely that **you compel individuals or groups to quickly move into action by using official-sounding words**. Your extensive vocabulary also contains hard-to-understand terminology that sets you apart. Thus, you speak with an air of authority that you often fail to hear. So, when you display impatience and say, “Let’s get started right now!” many **people refrain from questioning your decision**.

#### You encourage others

Driven by your talents, **you have a gift for raising a person’s self-esteem**. You notice something special he or she said. Then you formally or informally **acknowledge the individual’s most interesting ideas**. Because of your strengths, **you regularly energize people with your ideas** about what can be changed or done better. You frequently describe how individuals or groups can benefit from your suggestions. Your optimistic approach is apt to inspire people to design improvement plans. You probably rally individuals to support and execute those plans.

# Astrology

While astrology is nonsense, there are some positive psychological implications of reading somebody tell you who you are. People often act out the behavior others recognize in them, whether true or false. This is known as a self-fulfilling prophesy, a term most people are familiar with from academic studies. So to have some blind fun, [here we go](https://www.costarastrology.com/zodiac-signs/aries-sign):

## Ares

![](https://www.costarastrology.com/4a42e8f7706f48f13c00c8c69986706f.svg)

| SYMBOL        | The ram                      |
|---------------|------------------------------|
| DATES         | March 20 – April 19 for 2023 |
| ELEMENT       | Fire                         |

Ares, the Greek **god of war**, was considered one of the twelve Olympian gods residing on Mount Olympus. He was often depicted as a strong and fierce warrior wielding weapons such as a spear or a sword.

### Personality

At their core, Aries ==do things their own way==. They are ==unafraid of conflict==, highly ==competitive,== and ==honest==. They throw themselves at the world eagerly and without fear.

Aries are driven by a ==desire to prove themselves and their strength==. They have ==high energy==, and are competitive and ==ambitious==. They naturally ==take charge== because they are good at ==initiating new projects==. They can also be impatient, but are naturally active and don’t like to waste time.

While Aries like competition, they don’t like to play games. They are highly self-aware, have strong opinions and are always ready to defend them.

### Weaknesses

All Aries want to feel things intensely. This is one of their most commendable qualities, but also what causes them a great deal of pain and grief. Aries tend to be ==impulsive, impatient, and hotheaded==. They are often ==reacting out of emotion== rather than from a place of calm clear-headedness. They do not apologize for their anger. They say “I don’t care” and mean it. They don’t always have the best self-control.

### Traits

- No filter
- Gets angry, then forgets why they were angry
- Thinks everything is a game they can win
- Will do anything on a dare
- Easily bored

# Selective Attention and Cognitive Filtering

**Sensory Processing Sensitivity**: the threshold at which sensory information is deemed salient enough to be elevated to working memory.

People have individual differences in sensory processing sensitivity, and I would call this your **Brain Sensory Processing Footprint** or **Neuro-Sensory Modulation Profile**.

My [[Working Memory|Neuro-Sensory Modulation Profile]] indicates that my brain has a low threshold of moving sensory input into working memory for further analysis, which can cause me to be quickly overwhelmed when sensory input in an environment is high enough. When noise is above 90db for longer than an hour my brain begins to shut down and I become a vegetable.

If I'm at Six Flags engaging in the noise, riding Roller Coasters, talking to my friends, my brain is in a relaxed enough state of mind that my threshold becomes higher and I don't have a problem. But if I'm observing the noise without engaging in it, my brain kicks into overdrive and begins processing everything in working memory, making me fatigued.
