# Posing the Question
---
For me, ==the underlying question behind “What do I want to do?” wasn’t, “How much will I get paid?” but “how much am I producing?”== And nobody tells you that. You never get a real sense about the value of the work that you’re doing. All you get is a paycheck, and you have no idea what you’re worth. That’s why I didn’t like network marketing, because I said, “What am I actually producing in terms of value?” I do not want to help usher in a normative form of work that doesn’t create intrinsic value. I think in the future people will ask, “What is my work accomplishing in terms of intrinsic value?”

# Types of Value
---
- Physiological : The presence of nutrition that your body ingests to increase general quality of life; calories that your body needs for its daily functions.
- Pleasure : The amount of serotonin, endorphins, and other neurotransmitters that are aroused in the pleasure center of the brain.
- Translated : Doing something of low intrinsic value to free up the time of people who would otherwise have to waste their high labor-hour-valued time doing it. (Translation value doesn’t create value, it just saves someone else from not wasting their labor hours on the thing you’re doing. (Translation value doesn’t create value, it just saves someone else from not wasting their labor hours on the thing you’re doing).
- Enhancement : Improving the efficiency of another person's labor hour by inventing better technology.
- Learning : Increasing the value of one's own labor hour by being educated to operate existing technology or methods.
- Eternal : The presence of pleasure hormones that are experienced in the presence of God, the peace that accompanies trusting in him, and entrance into the eternal Kingdom of God.
- Market / Perceived : The dollar amount that people are willing to pay for a good or service.
- Consumption : Receiving intangible goods, like a massage, which produces pleasure.
- Complimentary : A pizza box is worth about 37 cents, but it adds complimentary value.

# Maslonion Standards Of Value
---
I think standards should somehow be based on usefulness in conjunction with Maslow’s hierarchy and Hovind’s time theory. Consider the value of an apple:

Use: Sustaining human life (physiological), experiencing pleasure (pleasure)
Time: 1.2 hours (100 calories / 83 calories needed per hour), 3 minutes (pleasure ends shortly after you swallow).

Usefulness Importance: Necessary
Pleasure Rating: Weak
Fixed time to produce: 6 - 10 years (for the tree to grow)
Variable Time to produce: 100 - 200 days
Effort to produce: little (the tree does the work)
Education required: none.
Complexity / difficulty: low.

Somehow we're going to need translate this data into a dollar amount that correlates to another item's data points.

If you live for 80 hears (700,800), and an apple keeps you alive for 6 hours, it would take 116,800 sustain you for your whole life. If you pay 25 cents per apple, that’s $29,200 you spent to stay alive. Now let’s face it, you’re not going to have 4 apples a day and call it sufficient. More reasonably, let’s say you spend $200 dollars per month on yourself for food and water. That’s $192,000 over your lifetime to get your physiological needs met (we’ll assume other needs like sleep, excretion, breathing, etc. are free. You have built in “sleeping trees” in your body that automatically grow that commodity—pretty cool). That’s how much intrinsic value you are responsible to create during your life to knock out level one. That’s how much your basic survival costs in America

Once we add up the cost of all these levels of Maslow’s hierarchy we consume over a lifetime, how much do we produce over a lifetime? And subsequently, how much value should we be producing per labor hour (in conjunction with how many labor hours we use in a lifetime (40 years * 8 hr/day =11,680))?

The value of our labor hours decrease commensurately with Maslow’s hierarchy, but they increase inversely with it in regards to importance. The base things must be fulfilled first. They’re less valuable, but more important (maybe a value distortion). Quality of life is more important than survival. The reason people want to survive is if they love life, or fear death. It’s an instinct. But it’s not really worth living if you suck at it. It’s not worth living if your quality of life is so bad that you wish you were dead.

So farming is the standard, I think, by which other professions should derive their value. A farmer will produce enough food for about 100 people assuming a 2,000-calorie diet on an annual basis. That’s 33 million dollars over 80 years. If he works 40 years, it’s half that, still 16.5 million dollars across 40 years of 8 hour work days. How much will he consume?

The markets decide value, and I’m going to work under the false assumption that people assign reasonably accurate value to products in the market when they pay for them. After I decipher the market value (opposed to intrinsic value) of products, I can do a dollar comparison between products of physiological needs and products of higher needs and evoke the question, “Is it really worth it?” Is it really worth $5 to keep this lamp on for an hour when you can pay 30 cents to keep this one on?

## Dependence and Duty
---
If you have a family, you’re going to provide for them. Let’s say you go out to eat with a certain amount of money, and you can either buy 4 portions to feed your family, or 1 quality portion and desert to feed yourself and your family would be left hungry. What would you do? You’d provide for your family. Why? Because you care about them. We know intrinsically that their physiological needs are more valuable than our excellence in Maslow’s hierarchy. The reason we don’t provide for people in other countries while we stuff our faces and sleep in a nice house is because we don’t care about them. It just is. If they were your family, you’d give up your house before you’d let them starve. And it’s fine if you don’t care about them, but you need to admit that. It isn’t practical for you to hang out at the first level in Maslow’s hierarchy until everybody can advance with you.

## Gallon of Milk vs. Gallon of Gasoline
---
I was at a doughnut shop with my brother one morning, and as we were talking we came to the epiphany that a gallon of gas cost the same as a gallon of milk. A stranger chimed in on the conversation, “Yeah, I’ve thought about that before. It’s like, should we be surprised that it cost $4 for oil that comes from the cow that dies and turns into oil over millions of years, or $4 for the milk that comes from the cow across the street?” His 5-7 year old child tried chiming in, to which his dad responded, “We’re talking bout adult stuff.” It made me chuckle a little bit, because it seemed like such a silly conversation to talk about. Who thinks about that? But what we were doing is a value comparison. It takes a lot longer to produce oil than milk, and they cost the same. That’s astonishing. This man recognized the intrinsic principle that something is more valuable if it takes longer to produce. The cow dies and decomposes for millions of years until it turns into oil. Or you can just squeeze on the dangly things and out comes milk. Same value? No, but same price.

## Fast Food Worker

What is a service worth? Well, intrinsically if you’re preparing a meal for me, you did nothing to add physiological value to the raw food (in terms of nutrition, calories, etc.—survival), but you added pleasurable value. That’s worth some, but it’s worth less than the value of the food you’re improving. Let’s say you spend an hour improving the pleasure value of food for 25 people, the raw food is worth $3 on it’s own, the improved pleasure value is worth 20% of its base value, making it worth $3.60, your net value being worth 60 cents per meal, multiplied by 25 people gives you $15. Now additionally, let’s say these 25 people’s labor hours are worth $50 per person, and from lack of specialization it takes them 30 minutes to prepare their own meal (which took you an average of 2.4 minutes because of specialization—the equipment, being ready, being trained, etc). And because you are 15 minutes closer than home, it saved them another 30 minutes in commute time, saving them a net value of 1 (labor) hour, freeing it up to do what they specialize in. Instead of wasting time driving home, preparing a meal, and driving back, they can use that hour to work (1 labor hour = $50), meaning you just saved $1,250 from being wasted by driving home, preparing a meal, and driving back. That’s something that needs to be calculated in wage. It’s not intrinsic value, but it’s something like translated value. Or redeeming value. You’re doing something of low intrinsic value to free up the time of people who would otherwise have to waste their high labor-hour-valued time doing it. Maybe it’s preventative value, because you’re preventing waste. The bottom line is, that translated value should be accounted for. Remember, the value of that $3 mean only increases by 60 cents, making the total hour it took each worker to drive home, prepare the meal, and drive back worth only 60 cents. That means it reduces their normal labor hour of $50 to 60 cents (or $3.60 if you include the meal raw meal). But it has to be done. Let’s say you get paid 20% of the value you translated from 60 cents to $50, (or redeemed from 60 cents to $50), being $9.88. Multiplied by 25 that’s $247. For one hour. That’s pretty decent. But nobody is willing to pay for the translated value because nobody is thinking about it. All they think is, “meal = $13.48 for what I can make at home for $3. No.” They’re not thinking, “meal = $13.48, hour = $50, DIY = $3+$50, meal = $39.52 savings.”


## Introduction
---
As I sat in my classroom as a 20 year old college student pondering what to do with my life, I realized I didn't just want to make money. I already knew how to make money. I knew how to trade option contracts, and I had been trained as a technical analyst, and I knew how to think probabilistically. But I heard a lot of preaching about the 50% of the world who's living on less than $2 a day, and I saw videos about ending world hunger from The Isaiah 58 Movement, and I heard spoken word poetry and listened to songs, and watched other videos that compelled me to be a part of making a difference in the world. I wanted to obey Ephesians 4:28, and with a background in Sim City and horticulture, I decided to spearhead a movement in vertical farming, helping the world build magnificent eco-cities with organic food being grown in a towering edifice. Then I realized the world already grows enough food. The problem wasn't with production, the problem was with distribution. So I thought, "The world doesn't need me to flip burgers at McDonalds. The World needs to be parented. Change will take place behind the pulpits of America. And the problem isn't that there isn't enough information, but too much to sort through, so I'm going to search through sermons, find the important few minutes, add graphics and kinetic typography, and present it on a YouTube channel to help shape the world." I knew that wouldn't make any money, but I could make money doing Technical Analysis and help the world through Kinetic Typography. Nevertheless, as I made these videos, and saw how much other graphic designers and media content creators were making, I thought, "These videos aren't worth that kind of money. What does it actually produce? You can't eat it, you can't hold it. What makes it valuable?"
