There are 3 core tenets of Technical Analysis:

1. Price moves in trends
2. History repeats itself
3. Market action discounts everything

[1] Markets move in trends because there are 2 emotions that motivate trading decisions: greed and fear. When the markets are moving up, people want to capitalize on it. We want to get in on the bus, like sheep following the flock. That's why 90% of traders lose 90% of their money 90% of the time. There's an old adage: Pigs get slaughtered. But it's human psychology, and it's been that way for 200 years, and it's not changing.

[2] It's a game of psychology. Markets don't move. Markets are moved. And it's moved in one of two ways: the institutions that have a lot of money, and the broad market that has a lot of money. The institutions trade by a set of rules, because they've found that their rules work, and therefore they keep applying them over and over again, which makes us able to look at price patterns and say, "Oh, a bull flag. We've got a series of higher highs and higher lows, it's consolidating a little right now. The market is more likely to go up than not." We're dealing in probabilities. History keeps repeating itself because institutional human beings make similar decisions repetitively.

[3] Market action discounts everything just means that there are a thousand variables influencing the market right now. Not 1 piece of information, but thousands. And all of that information is projected into the chart and into price movement. We don't need to know the information. All the information is right there on the chart. All we need to know in technical analysis is trend, support and resistance, and momentum indicators, and that we can forget about the other 996 pieces of information.
