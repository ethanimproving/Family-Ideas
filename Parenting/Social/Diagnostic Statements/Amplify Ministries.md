We live in a world today where only a small percent of the population actually needs to work to create enough goods for the whole world to have a decent life. 2% of the population produces enough food for 20 billion people. We produce enough grain for every person in the world to have 2 pounds per day. World hunger is not a problem is production. It's a problem in distribution.

So as a 20 year-old college student pondering what to do with my life, I realized that the world does not need me to spearhead a movement in vertical farming to make food production more efficient. <mark class="hltr-yellow">The world doesn't need to produce more, the world needs to be parented</mark>. We have the technology and the resources to put every person in the world in a mansion. The reason 50% of the world lives on less than $2 a day is because the other 50% is complacent. If we would send a lawn mower to

# Two Strategies

There's only two strategies I have to make an impact on the world. The reality is that I can only knock on so many people's door before I run out of time. So changing the world by personally evangelizing it doesn't work.

## Discipleship: Exponential Growth

> [!Bible] [Proverbs 11:30 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Proverbs+11:30?translation=kjv)
> 30. The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that winneth souls is wise.

> [!Bible] [Luke 8:14 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/luke+8:14?translation=kjv)
> 14. And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.

If we are to reach the world, we have to bring our fruit to perfection. We have to enlist them into the Kingdom, and hire them. Every time we win someone to the Lord, they're standing around in a market saying, "No man hath hired us." Hire them! Send them out! Equip the believer to exalt the Lord by engaging the world. That was the mission statement of Northlake Baptist Church for a long time:

```
- Exalt the Lord
- Eqip the Believer
- Engage the World
```

I'm 27. There's 12 hours in a day. If I work until I'm 70, I could go soul-winning for 11,180 hours. That's 11 thousand people saved.

$$12 hours * 260 work days/year*43 years = 11,180 hours$$

But if every month I get 1 person saved, and I spend time with them, and make them a fruit-bearing tree so that they get 1 person saved each month, and we repeat the cycle, it would only be 33 months until we've evangelized the entire 8 billion population of the world.

Geometric series formula:
$$S_n = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)$$
```
-   S_n represents the sum of the first n terms of the series.
-   a represents the first term of the series.
-   r represents the common ratio between consecutive terms of the series.
-   n represents the number of terms in the series.
```

$$2^n - 1 = 8,000,000,000$$

## Scalable Information: Unlimited Growth

The other way to reach people is by creating scalable information, such as a video that can be viewed an unlimited number of times. This is where Amplify Ministries came in for me. I wanted to create a platform where people can grow qualitatively from video resources that inspire them and stir up their affections and zeal for walking with Jesus.
