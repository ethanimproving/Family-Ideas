The point of a diagnostic statement is to identify a few core parts of your life or your thinking so that you can make a strong and intentional impression of yourself to people you meet. I only use these statements when appropriate. Often times I meet people at their door when I'm preaching the gospel to them. They already have the impression that Ethan is a strong Christian. Who else is Ethan?
