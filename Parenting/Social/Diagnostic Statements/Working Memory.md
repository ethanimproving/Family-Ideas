# 3 Stages Of MemoryA

When I was in Psychology class in college we learned about the 3 stages of memory. 

1. **Sensory Memory**: Sensory memory is the earliest stage of memory processing and holds sensory information from the environment for a brief period of time (==milliseconds to a few seconds==) after the original stimulus is no longer present. It includes *iconic memory* (visual) and *echoic memory* (auditory).
    
2. **Short-Term Memory (STM)**: Short-term memory, also known as working memory, temporarily holds a limited amount of information (typically around 7 items) for a short duration (==up to 30 seconds==) while it is actively being processed. Working memory is involved in tasks such as *problem-solving, decision-making, and comprehension*.
    
3. **Long-Term Memory (LTM)**: Long-term memory stores information over a longer duration, ==potentially for a lifetime==, and has a much larger capacity than short-term memory. It includes *explicit (declarative) memory*, which involves ==conscious recall of facts and events==, and *implicit (procedural) memory*, which involves ==unconscious recall of skills and habits==.
    
    - **Episodic Memory**: Episodic memory stores autobiographical memories of specific events and experiences, along with contextual details such as time, place, and emotions.
        
    - **Semantic Memory**: Semantic memory stores general knowledge and facts about the world, including concepts, meanings, and language.
        
    - **Procedural Memory**: Procedural memory stores information about how to perform specific tasks or skills, such as riding a bike or playing a musical instrument. It is typically acquired through practice and repetition and is less dependent on conscious awareness.
        
    - **Priming**: Priming refers to the phenomenon where exposure to one stimulus influences the response to another stimulus, often without conscious awareness. It reflects the influence of implicit memory processes on behavior and perception.

# Pattern Recognition

Some people have higher levels of filtering criteria for what their brain flags as important enough to elevate to the next stage of memory. Typically those who score higher on IQ tests have higher pattern recognition (also making them more inclined to believe in conspiracy theories, because they see patterns where others don't, and even sometimes where none exist at all). This is partially related to how their brain decides if sensory input is important enough to elevate to working memory. Those whose brains tend to transfer more items as important have higher pattern recognition, but it can also overstimulate them when there is an overflow of sensory input in the environment, such as loud music over 90db.

# Personal Statement

When I’m at a party with music over 90db for too long, eventually I feel like my brain is overstimulated and I’m too exhausted to have a good time anymore. If there is no music I can socialize for hours without a problem, but the loudness seems to overwhelm me.

When you're exposed to loud music or noise for an extended period, your brain has to work harder to process and filter out the excessive sensory input. This can lead to fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and feeling overwhelmed, making it harder to enjoy socializing or other activities.

I remember reading about working memory and how the brain filters stimuli to ignore certain things. Does this mean my brain isn’t as efficient at filtering the noise out as others? I’m curious to explore any psychological implications this might have.

I have a few other observations. I’m bad at multitasking while driving. I will often miss turns because I’m engaged in a conversation and I was totally oblivious to the direction.

Another observation about myself is that I don’t like to be interrupted while I’m working. I’m popular at work so people come to my desk ALL the time and interrupt my flow of thought while I’m solving a problem. It’s a little annoying to have to remember what train of thought I was exploring. I prefer to be uninterrupted in those cases.

What cognitive insights can you gather about me from these 3 tendencies, including disliking the loud music at parties?
