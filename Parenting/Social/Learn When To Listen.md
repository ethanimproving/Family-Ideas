[Know When To STFU And LISTEN!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lg1A8Ijb7Y)

When I found out Justin is making eight figures with this company, I realize ==when I'm hanging around Justin, it's time for me as a 36 year old man to enter "shut the fuck up and listen mode" because Justin is far more successful than I am, and so around him, me talking is a negative ROI==.
