[What are the behaviors of a confident person?](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-behaviors-of-a-confident-person)

Observe confident people around you. You’ll find these 9 behaviors in them:

1. They don’t cross their arms.

Confident people don’t cross their arms because they’re not feeling defensive, nor do they have anything to hide.

2. They don't constantly check social media.

Mindlessly scrolling through social media can waste more time than you imagine. A confident person knows how to use their time wisely to be more productive.

3. They listen 10 times more than they speak.

Truly confident people already know what they think, they want to know what you think.

4. They celebrate their peers’ successes.

Insecure people don’t want others to succeed. When confident people say “good luck” to someone, they sincerely mean it.

5. They don’t seek approval from others.

Confident people gain attention due to their brilliant work. Since their self-worth comes within, they don’t need approval from others.

6. They never gossip.

Confident people realizes that another person’s private is none of their business. When people engage in gossip, all it serves to do is make themselves more judgmental and toxic.

7. They’re in a pleasant mood most of the time.

Confident people aren’t easily thrown off their emotional game. They don’t feel insulted or slighted as easily as other people, and this is part of their appeal.

8. They maintain eye contact.

Eye contact is a shared experience and one of the most powerful tools in human face-to-face interaction.

9. They aren’t ashamed to ask for help.

Confident people are secure enough to admit a weakness. Saying “Can you help me?” Shows tremendous respect for that individual’s expertise and judgement.
