# Make A Clear Goal

Those who seek to impact others tend to look for the different forces that shape the behavior they want to change and use them to their advantage. These forces come from six sources: personal motivation, personal ability, social motivation, social ability, structural motivation, and structural ability.  

Some of the common mistakes that undermine people’s ability to influence others are:

• Vague goals
• Infrequent or no measures
• Bad measures  

The way you define your objectives determines whether you will influence others. Having a clear and compelling goal engages the brain and hearts of others.[^1]

# Personal Motivation  

Personal motivation means influencing others to take pleasure in what they do not particularly enjoy. Influencers have used some of these outlined techniques to help people love what they hate:

• Allow for choice: the best way to get commitment from others is by letting them know that they have the power to say no.

• Create direct experiences: the best way to help people understand the implication of their actions is to allow them to experience them. This is an excellent way to transform people because it spurs them to adopt new and better behaviors.

• Storytelling: if getting people to create direct experience seems difficult, telling a meaningful and compelling story can be a powerful tool in influencing others to change their behaviors. Storytelling helps awaken people to the consequences of their actions.

• Game: another crucial way to make people love a behavior they hate is by turning it into something that feels like a game. People tend to enjoy any activity that involves clear goals and feedback.[^1]

# Work In Groups

According to author James Surowiecki, ==working in groups yields better results than doing things alone==. So, one key way in influencing people is to bring them together to form a team and encourage them to assist each other in achieving their individual goals.
