# Weakness isn't moral virtue.
* [Jordan Peterson: you have to be dangerous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLQlh1G9Ldw)

If you're not a formidable force, there's no morality in your self control. If you're incapable of violence, not being violent isn't a virtue. The combination of the capacity for danger and the capacity for control is what brings about the virtue. Otherwise you confuse weakness with moral virtue. "I'm harmless therefore I'm good." That's not how it works. If you're harmless you're just weak. And if you're weak you're not going to be good. You can't be, because it takes strength to be good.

# Be in control of your base passions
* [Andrew Tate & Michael Knowls: What makes a high value man?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLUgseVJheE&t=1304s)

The high value man is in control of his base passions. Man has two wills that exist simultaneously: the lower will, which is the apatite, the passion (it's when you want to eat some cookies in the cookie jar), and then there's the higher will, which is the rational will that tells you, "No if I eat all the cookies in the cookie jar I'm going to have a tummy ache so I'm not going to do that." A high value man will be in great command and follow his rational will and subdue his passion.

## Men who are obsessed with sex are advertising that they're deprived of it

Sex in and of itself is boring. Any man who sits and says that sex is great or sex is fun just clearly hasn't had enough sex. Sex is a chore. Sex is like food. You don't really care unless you're really hungry and then you eat and you don't care again. It's one of those things you go you do every once in a while because it's an urge but it's not a real big deal. Every person needs food, and every person likes food, but if you're someone who goes through life and only only only talks
about and cares about food it's a bit weird. Same thing with sex. Sex is something that happens, and this happens between people who love each other, and it's a great thing, but it's not the be all and end all of life. I don't think sex is the most stimulating and interesting thing in the world. 

Any dude who's like, "Wow! Wow! Two pairs of tits!" just hasn't fucked very much. Who gives a shit? I just think that men who are super super interested in sex or sexual fantasies of these things are men who are semi-deprived. If you have an abundance of food, if you have a fridge full of food all the time, you don't eat all the time. Sometimes you just don't want to. It's always there. But if you're starving, as soon as food appears you're all over it. It's the same with sex. Any dude was like, "Wow threesome? Okay." is a guy who's deprived. A guy who has as much as he wants all the time ain't going to be really that interested in it.

Sex is not a complicated operation. There's no move that is going to make a man like, "oh wow, I've never seen this before and my mind is blown!" If you think the way to keep a man happy is to move your pussy in a particular way on top of his dick as opposed to behaving in a way that is respectful to him out in the real world, and for him to know he has you and your loyalty regardless of all the problems that are going to come into his life, than you're wrong.
