> [!bible] [Leviticus 25:14-19 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Leviticus+25:14-19?translation=kjv)
> 14. And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of thy neighbourâ€™s hand, ye shall not oppress one another:
> 15. According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, and according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee:
> 16. According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it: for according to the number of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee.
> 17. Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear thy God: for I am the LORD your God.
> 18. Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.
> 19. And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety.
