Just as a baby loves breast milk because it can handle that, as a new Christian there are a lot of doctrines in the Bible that you can digest and understand. They need the sincere milk of the word.

Sincere means true, honest, without deceit. A mother who chooses to breastfeed has healthier babies. They desire it more. It’s sincere milk vs formula. Formula is going to cause more gas and digestion issues. Formula will get them through but it’s not going to be ideal. You can use the NASB to get someone saved, but is it ideal?

Who are we going to teach knowledge to? It’s somebody who’s weened from milk. The baby is the one on the milk, but the mature believer is weened off of milk by adding the understanding of doctrine. 
> [!Bible] [Isaiah 28:9 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Isaiah+28:9?translation=kjv)
> 9. Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine?
them that are weaned from the milk,
and drawn from the breasts.


Approach new believers with the right mindset. When a baby cries it gets milk on demand. When new believers ask questions, we need to give them the milk on demand. Don’t be compelled to give them meat that they aren’t ready for. Pistol is getting mad at a church because it’s too carnal. They need to lay down the basics. 
> [!Bible] [1 Corinthians 3:1-2 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/1Corinthians+3:1-2?translation=kjv)
> 1. And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal,
even as unto babes in Christ.
> 2. I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able
to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.


A mature Christian is going to bless you, but a baby Christian is going to be a strain on your life, just like real children. Don’t be a hypocrite. Be without offense until the day of Christ. If you are a hypocrite it will discourage that Christian from serving God. If you teach someone to avoid fornication, and then you bring them to the bedroom, you’re going to discourage her from following God. She’s going to follow your lead. If Baptist’s are known for having pedophiles working in the church, when we knock on people’s doors and say we’re Baptists, it will cause reproach.
> [!Bible] [Philippians 1:9-11 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Philippians+1:9-11?translation=kjv)
> 9. And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment;
> 10. That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ;
> 11. Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.


> [!Bible] [Titus 2:7 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Titus+2:7?translation=kjv)
> 7. In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,


# 3. Be concerned about the growth of new believers.

The point of milk is to grow.

There are about 17.5 million saved Christians in America. If each Christian went soul winning, they would only need to preach to 20 people to reach the entire nation. We would be done in 1 hour. Kids want to grow up to be the garbage man. And you tell them, “Eh, no.” Baby Christians may want to be a missionary to Israel, and you’re like, “No.”
> [!Bible] [Hebrews 5:12-14 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Hebrews+5:12-14?translation=kjv)
> 12. For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.
> 13. For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.
> 14. But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even  those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.


Mothers are always worried if their babies are growing enough, if their cheeks are fat enough, and we should have the same zeal for baby Christians. Cut off the crust if necessary. We want to identify the babes in Christ and make sure they’re growing.
> [!Bible] [Ephesians 4:11-15 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Ephesians+4:11-15?translation=kjv)
> 11. And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;
> 12. For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:
> 13. Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:
> 14. That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and  cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;
> 15. But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:


It takes a lot of effort to study a passage, pray about it, and understand what it means, but it’s a blessing to serve that to someone else. Just like carving a watermelon is a lot of effort, and it’s a blessing to someone else to just eat it effort free.

# 4. Be gracious to new believers.

Praise God that the Lord himself is gracious. Expect new Christians to have lots of problems. 
> [!Bible] [1 Peter 2:3 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/1Peter+2:3?translation=kjv)
> 3. If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.


If someone is young in the faith and we start talking after service, they’ll probably bring up basketball, their job, coding, movies. Talk with them about that. Condescending means lowering yourself to another person’s level so that they can relate to you. Meet people where they’re at.
> [!Bible] [Romans 12:16 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Romans+12:16?translation=kjv)
> 16. Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.


We need to grow in grace. Almost every person struggles with this. 
> [!Bible] [2 Peter 3:17 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/2Peter+3:17?translation=kjv)
> 17. Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know
these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.


Paul always extended grace. Always. These churches have all kinds of problems and headaches, and he always gives them grace. Let us extend grace.
