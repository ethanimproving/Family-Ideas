# Why I Care About Sunday School At All

When I was in 10th grade I started to question if Sunday School was really a biblical concept. I had recently read through my Bible for the first time, and I expected to find so much more that would prescribe the activities we did at church, but there was actually a scarcity of similarity between the book of Acts, say, and church. The only scriptures I found that year that shed light on Sunday School were more-so against the idea of it than for it. For example, the Bible says there should be no factions in church (1 Corinthians 11:18), and having various Sunday school classes erects walls between groups of people based on age. Worse than that, Dawn Hallman will teach one set of doctrines that are not consistent with Randy Presell. Or Phillip Forester. Or my favorite, Russel Pearson. They were not all like minded. I read in James that there should not be many teachers, but the philosophy of Sunday School is based on the opposite course of action. Bringing in more teachers. It reminded me of a passage in the Old Testament where it said they made the lowest of the people priests. Furthermore, I read women were supposed to keep silence in the church (1 Timothy 2), and they were not supposed to teach (1 Corinthians 14), but in reality there were as many women teachers as there were men. Eventually I decided that I was going to go a church that was as close to the Bible as I could find.

Despite this, I do feel I learned some important things in Sunday School, especially from Russel Pearson. That man challenged me to read my Bible, and I viewed him as a mentor. I wanted to make him proud in my Christian walk. And that feeling of being challenged is something I want to carry forward for my children. I want to spur them on the way he spurred me on. ==Youth Group had an amazing way of inspiring kids to commit to God. It aroused the zeal of the younger generation.== I want to be able to [[Amplify Ministries|learn the skill of arousing zeal]], but to do it according to knowledge.

To aid in this endeavor, I've decided to review Sunday School curriculums and other False Prophets who have the gift of stirring people up. I want to motivate people, and be an expert at using my words to bring up people's desire for God. What techniques do they use? What works? What social skills have they learned that I can learn from? What persuasive tactics are there for my to use with the truth? They used it for lies, let me use it for truth. If I could combine the persuasive feeling of conviction they elicit in the hearts of teenagers, with all of the pure doctrine of the New IFB, I believe I could reach more people for God, which is my [[Life's Goals]].

# Sermons

In preparation for a Bible lesson on a chapter of the Bible, it is helpful to review sermons on the chapters you are teaching. If I was going to have a lesson on Matthew 5, I might search for Matthew 5 on th following resources:
- [All The Preaching](https://allthepreaching.com/pages/archive.php)
- [Faithful Word Baptist Church](https://thepreaching.com/)
- [Pastor Anderson Sermons](https://pastorandersonsermons.allthepreaching.com/index.php?fbclid=IwAR0k0oiT3isuk17GXZqbYkn3hAZse8vmdp9aGt7t_gYvHsK7O422y50n8Is)

# As Questions / Involve Others (Socratic Method)

If you tell somebody what to believe, they are less likely to believe it than if you ask leading questions and let them formulate the answer themselves. If it comes out of their own mind, they're more likely to believe it, because they are the ones that said it, not you.

[Bible curriculums](https://ministry-to-children.com/beatitudes-lesson-one/) of the past always asked uncomfortable questions to the class.
- Would somebody read Psalm 89:1-5?
- Turn a few pages in your Bible to Matthew 7:9-11. Who wants to read that for me? 
- Did anyone catch that important word?
- Did anyone catch how many times the word blessed appeared in this passage?
- So what is a blessing?

# Homework

The best thing Russel Pearson did for me was give us reading assignments to prepare for next week's lessons. Sometimes he would give us printouts to fill out, or sometimes he would just tell us which chapter we were going to be studying the next week. My favorite was John 15. That was the first time I fell in love with the Bible, because I went home and read it, and I make connections, and I understood it, and I came back to Sunday School with answers. I knew that fruit didn't mean Galatians 5:22. Bryan Atkins answered, "It's the fruit of the Spirit?" And I jumped in and said, "Nope! That's Galatians 5:22, but Jesus apart from me you can do nothing. Even unbelievers can have joy at times." And Russel encouraged me and was proud of that answer. That got be addicted to the Bible, because that feeling of someone being proud of me was a rush. It was immature, looking back, but that's what spurred me on.

When Dan McKenzie sponsored me for Vida Nueva, and I gave speeches in front of everyone, and at the end of every sentence men in the congregation shouted, "Amen!" I felt like I was meant for expounding the Bible. There was more energy in the room when I spoke than anybody else. I had a crowd of 4 men discussing doctrine with me all the next weekend, and I remember a man came to me and said, "That Richard guy worries me. I can't believe he's a teacher here. I really liked how you deal with him. You start out by saying, 'I like what you said here,' and then you correct him. That's sly, that's very sly." He told me I had a gift of riding the lines in a room of people that believe different things, and I could somehow manage to bring up scripture that rebukes their ideas without them realizing I was disagreeing with them. Without causing a fight. "I used to believe that! But then I read in John 15, check this out..."

# Prayer

I loved the time spent in prayer when I was in Blanchard's class. I also liked the words he would teach us on the whiteboard. But most of all I liked the encouragement.

# Encouragement

Making somebody feel like they contribute uniquely to the body of Christ makes them feel important. Watch people. Observe what their gifts are. Observe how the hand can reach people that the eye can't. How the feet can bring you places that the eye can't. Isolate what's special about that person, and tell them who they are and why they matter. Have a proud look in your eye. Make them feel like God has a special calling over their life, and they will reach a level of spirituality than most people will never attain. That God will use them greatly to [[Ethan's Commitments#I Follow The Example of Great Men|reach so many people]] and make a difference.

# Be Invasive

When I call Mariana, she answers. And she enjoys it. But when I text, "Are you busy for a call?" She ignores me. If you want to disciple people, sometimes affording them the opportunity to feed their flesh with TV is not the path forward.

You have to pursue people. Godliness is not automatic once you're born again. Just like surviving isn't automatic when you're born of water. It would be irresponsible to leave a newborn baby to fend for itself and "come to you" if it needs anything. You need to take care of that baby and raise it. And if you win somebody to Christ, you need to disciple that person. It's not somebody else's responsibility. I'm not saying "need" from a commandment perspective, as though it's a sin if you don't. I'm saying "need" from a necessity standpoint, because the chances of that person growing in Christ on their own is almost zero.
