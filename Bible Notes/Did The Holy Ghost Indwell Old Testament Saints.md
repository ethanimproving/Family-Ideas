# Unless I Go, The Spirit Cannot Come

> [!Bible] [John 16:7 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/john+16:7?translation=kjv)
> 7. Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: ==for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you==.

# David said the Spirit could be taken from him (not merely diminished in its power)

> [!Bible] [Psalms 51:11 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/psalm+51:11?translation=kjv)
> 11. Cast me not away from thy presence; and ==take not thy holy spirit from me.==

# At Pentecost Jesus Said To Wait Until He Goes

Why did Jesus say to wait until he send the Holy Ghost if we were all sealed beforehand? Being filled with the Spirit is temporary, and that could happen in the Old Testament at any time. God filled Saul,

> [!Bible] [Acts 1:4 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/acts+1:4?translation=kjv)
> 4. And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that ==they should *not* depart from Jerusalem, but **wait for the promise of the Father**==, which, saith he, ye have heard of me.


> [!Bible] [Acts 1:8 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/acts+1:8?translation=kjv)
> 8. But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.

> [!Bible] [Ephesians 1:13-14 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/ephesians+1:13-14?translation=kjv)
> 13. In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,
> 14. Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.

Seen as distinct from the experiences of Old Testament believers.

# God Could Come Upon Whoever He Wants In The OT

> [!Bible] [Exodus 31:3-5 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/exodus+31:3-5?translation=kjv)
> 3. And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,
> 4. To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,
> 5. And in cutting of stones, to set
them, and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship.

# The Disciples Couldn't Cast Out Certain Devils

Did they have the Holy Spirit before 

> [!Bible] [Matthew 17:19-21 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/matthew+17:19-21?translation=kjv)
> 19. Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?
> 20. And Jesus said unto them,
Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.
> 21. Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.

# The Tabernacle vs. Body Temples

In the Old Testament the Spirit of God dwelt in a tabernacle, and if you were unclean you would be killed instantly, which is why they tied a rope around the high priest. In case he died and they had to pull him out.

In the New Testament, the believer is the Temple of the Holy Ghost.

> [!Bible] [1 Corinthians 6:15 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/1corinthians+6:15?translation=kjv)
> 15. Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make
them the members of an harlot? God forbid.

> [!Bible] [1 Corinthians 6:19 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/1corinthians+6:19?translation=kjv)
> 19. What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?

> [!Bible] [John 9:5 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/john+9:5?translation=kjv)
> 5. As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.

In the Old Testament, the Holy Spirit is depicted as coming upon specific individuals for particular purposes, such as prophets, kings, and leaders. The Spirit's presence in the Old Testament is often temporary and selective, not universally experienced by all believers.

# People That Had The Holy Spirit Come Upon Them

1. Moses (Numbers 11:25)
2. Joshua (Deuteronomy 34:9)
3. Bezalel (Exodus 31:2-3)
4. Othniel (Judges 3:10)
5. Gideon (Judges 6:34)
6. Jephthah (Judges 11:29)
7. Samson (Judges 13:25, 14:6, 14:19, 15:14)
8. Saul (1 Samuel 10:10, 11:6)
9. David (1 Samuel 16:13)
10. Elijah (1 Kings 18:12)
11. Elisha (2 Kings 2:9-15)

The boys are arguing that everybody was sealed with the Holy Spirit in the Old Testament, but that when Pentecost came that made it possible for all believers to be simultaneously filled with the Holy Spirit. However, the filling can fluctuate. So if that's the case, nothing changed. God could fill whoever he wanted in the Old Testament. Jesus said the Spirit cannot come until he goes to the Father. Why? Because Jesus needs to be the one to send him.

> [!Bible] [Jeremiah 31:31-34 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Jeremiah+31:31-34?translation=kjv)
> 31. Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:
> 32. Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day
that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the LORD:
> 33. But this
shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; **After those days**, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.
> 34. And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the LORD; for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.

> [!Bible] [Ezekiel 36:26-27 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Ezekiel+36:26-27?translation=kjv)
> 26. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.
> 27. And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.


> [!Bible] [Matthew 1:23 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/matthew+1:23?translation=kjv)
> 23. Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name ==Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us==.


> [!Bible] [Romans 8:9 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/romans+8:9?translation=kjv)
> 9. But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.

# John's Disciples Didn't Know If There Was A Holy Spirit

> [!Bible] [Acts 19:2 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/acts+19:2?translation=kjv)
> 2. He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.
