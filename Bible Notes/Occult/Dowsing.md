Before delving into learning about occult practices out of interest, or because you are seeking something exciting to talk about, consider the following warning that we ought to avoid the pursuit of knowledge about evil practices. Your time is better spent knowing God, reading the Bible, and pursuing purity than pursuing knowledge about this topic.

> [!bible] [Romans 16:19 - KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+16:19&version=kjv)
> 19. For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I am glad therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, ==and simple concerning evil==.


Dowsing is considered a form of divination or a mystical practice used to uncover hidden information or energies, similar to tarot reading, scrying, or using a pendulum for communication with the spiritual realm. Practitioners believe that the dowsing tool can act as a conduit for spiritual or supernatural forces to reveal hidden knowledge.

Some occult practitioners believe that dowsing taps into the subconscious mind, revealing knowledge that is not accessible through ordinary conscious thought. Others view dowsing as a way to receive guidance from higher powers, spiritual guides, or the universe itself. It is seen as a tool that bridges the physical and spiritual worlds.

As Christians, we view this as potentially opening doors to demonic influences or spiritual deception.

# Dowsing as Fraudulent or Pseudoscientific

Other Christians might view dowsing as simply a fraudulent or pseudoscientific practice without any real spiritual or supernatural power. This perspective considers dowsing to be ineffective and based on superstition rather than genuine spiritual danger. Points supporting this view include:

- **Lack of Scientific Evidence**: Many skeptics, including some Christians, dismiss dowsing due to the lack of empirical evidence supporting its efficacy. They see it as a result of psychological phenomena like the ideomotor effect, where a person subconsciously moves the dowsing tool.
- **Rational Approach**: From a rationalist Christian perspective, practices without a sound basis in science or reason are often dismissed as superstitions. They might argue that God has given humans reason and intellect to discern truth from falsehood, and practices like dowsing fail to meet these standards.
- **Focus on Biblical Truth**: Some Christians prefer to focus on biblical teachings and prayer for guidance and problem-solving, seeing practices like dowsing as distractions from faith-based methods of seeking God's will.
