[Too Sensitive - Pastor Jonathan Shelley](https://rumble.com/v4w5bv6-too-sensitive-pastor-jonathan-shelley-stedfast-baptist-church.html?start=1795)

> [!bible] [1 Corinthians 13:5 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/1+Corinthians+13:5?translation=kjv)
> 5. Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, ==is not easily provoked==, thinketh no evil;

Bring too sensitive is a lack of charity. Christians should be the least sensitive. 

# 1. Bad jokes or dumb comments

We should ignore bad jokes and dumb comments. People say things at your expense, but don’t allow that to ruin your day. Let it go. Don’t act like it’s a big deal. People joke with you because they like you. That person is just being awkward. Being funny is difficult. Most people’s jokes fall flat.

> [!bible] [Mark 11:25 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Mark+11:25?translation=kjv)
> 25. And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.


If someone speaks a lot, it’s guaranteed they’re going to say something sinful. 

> [!bible] [Proverbs 10:19 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Proverbs+10:19?translation=kjv)
> 19. ==In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin==: but he that refraineth his lips is wise.


Bitterness is when someone does you wrong and you’re not getting over it. I’m not saying they weren’t rude. You can still let go. There’s no excuse to still be mad at what someone said. 
> [!bible] [Ephesians 4:31-32 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Ephesians+4:31-32?translation=kjv)
> 31. ==Let all bitterness==, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, ==be put away from you==, with all malice:
> 32. And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ’s sake hath forgiven you.


Fools say foolish things. You should expect that people are going to say weird things. 

> [!bible] [Proverbs 12:23 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Proverbs+12:23?translation=kjv)
> 23. A prudent man concealeth knowledge: but ==the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness==.


It would be weird for getting mad at your toddler for not being able to articulate themselves perfectly. God still treats us with love and kindness. Show the same grace. Condescend to men of low estate. 

> [!bible] [Romans 12:16 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Romans+12:16?translation=kjv)
> 16. Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.

It’s impossible to take the tongue. Recognize everyone says mistakes. Be ready to forgive others recognizing that no one is capable of keeping their tongue perfectly. Don’t hold people accountable for every single thing people speak. Strive to be very charitable towards others and afford them the opportunity to say dumb things. When you are bitter it’s a devilish attitude, to hold people accountable for every thing that they say. We should try to make peace, not cause strife. Don’t continually try to escalate the strife. Our world is trying to shield children from any level of criticism.

> [!bible] [James 3:8-18 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/James+3:8-18?translation=kjv)
> 8. But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.
> 9. Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.
> 10. Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.
> 11. Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?
> 12. Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.
> 13. Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.
> 14. But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.
> 15. This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish. > 16. For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.
> 17. But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.
> 18. And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.

> [!bible] [Proverbs 15:2 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Proverbs+15:2?translation=kjv)
> 2. The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright: but ==the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness==.

Foolish people can’t understand the Bible. 

> [!bible] [Proverbs 26:9 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Proverbs+26:9?translation=kjv)
> 9. As a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so is  a parable in the mouth of fools.

Jesus attitude was to forgive them because they don’t know what they’re doing. We should have the same attitude. 

# 2. Get over false criticism.

People will say you’re doing something wrong when you’re not even doing something wrong. “If you’re dumb, come listen to me.” But she’s the dumb one. Don’t allow their criticisms to affect you. 

> [!bible] [Proverbs 9:13-18 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Proverbs+9:13-18?translation=kjv)
> 13. ==A foolish woman is clamorous==: she is simple, and knoweth nothing.
> 14. For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,
> 15. To call passengers who go right on their ways:
> 16. ==Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither==: and as for  him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,
> 17. Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.
> 18. But he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that  her guests are in the depths of hell.

There are times when you have thought negatively about someone. Think about that when someone curses you and don’t give it any weight. You are judgmental if you think it, not if you say it. Take no heed to what people say that are false.

> [!bible] [Ecclesiastes 7:20-22 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Ecclesiastes+7:20-22?translation=kjv)
> 20. For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.
> 21. Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee:
> 22. For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that ==thou thyself likewise hast cursed others==.

It would not be healthy if we had a printout of every persons thoughts. ==We should not hold people accountable for everything they said==. 

# 3. Embrace true criticism. 

If you can’t handle criticism, you will be a foolish person. Feedback means they are investing in you. The guy that loves you is going to rebuke you. 
> [!bible] [2 Timothy 3:16-17 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/2+Timothy+3:16-17?translation=kjv)
> 16. All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and ==is  profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction==, for instruction in righteousness:
> 17. That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.

> [!bible] [Leviticus 19:17 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Leviticus+19:17?translation=kjv)
> 17. Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.


If someone legitimately criticizes you, change. 
> [!bible] [Titus 2:15 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Titus+2:15?translation=kjv)
> 15. These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.


# 4. Be slow to anger. 

Be slow to anger.

> [!bible] [Proverbs 16:32 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Proverbs+16:32?translation=kjv)
> 32. He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.

> [!bible] [Proverbs 15:18 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Proverbs+15:18?translation=kjv)
> 18. A wrathful man stirreth up strife: but
he that is slow to anger appeaseth strife.

> [!bible] [Proverbs 14:17 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Proverbs+14:17?translation=kjv)
> 17. He that is soon angry dealeth foolishly: and a man of wicked devices is hated.

# 5. Tolerate diversity.

Safe spaces are almost always for faggots. LGBT can’t tolerate anything. If you despise reproof you shall die. 

> [!bible] [Romans 14:1-4 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Romans+14:1-4?translation=kjv)
> 1. Him that is weak in the faith receive ye,
but not to doubtful disputations.
> 2. For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.
> 3. Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.
> 4. Who art thou that judgest another man’s servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.

> [!bible] [Proverbs 15:10 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Proverbs+15:10?translation=kjv)
> 10. Correction is grievous unto him that forsaketh the way: and he that hateth reproof shall die.
