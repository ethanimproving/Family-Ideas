[Welcome to Sunday School! (16 Jul 2024)](https://fb.watch/sO726jIUXC/) - Pastor Coombs

God will tempt us with hard times, but he won’t tempt us with evil (James 1:13).

> [!bible] [James 1:13 - KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+1:13&version=kjv)
> 13. Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:

We don’t see any hesitation at what God requested. He trusted God and believed God. Abraham has been waiting for this promise his whole life and God performed miracles to make it happen. Abraham knew God was not going to take that away. ==He believed God when there was no human understanding of getting through the test==. 

Peter was tested too. Peter failed when he denied Christ. But Jesus restores Peter and he became a force for God. 

This is the moment when Abraham’s faith shined. ==Other people can look at his action and say, “That action makes no sense if he didn’t believe God’s promise heavily.”== Abraham was already saved (Romans 4:1-3), but now that faith was made manifest to men who can’t search the heart (James 2:20-23). Peter had faith as well, but a human wouldn’t know that based on his actions when he denied Christ. Peter lived by fear instead of faith that day. Abraham lived by faith instead of fear this day. Peter knew the truth would set him free. He didn’t believe that promise. 

Before you can be a man of faith, you must first know the promises of God. You cannot believe what you do not know. 

Humans debate whether Peter had faith in the Gospels. Why? Because he was not justified before men until his actions showed it. But nobody debates if Abraham had faith. Why? He justified himself before man.

What actions have you taken that don’t make sense unless you believed a promise of God?

Isaac is a type of Christ. 

Pastor Coombs is a man of faith. He doesn’t worry about money. Pastor Shelley is a warrior. He works two jobs. 

Abraham had a 3 day journey. 3 days to contemplate. Yet he started faithful. Full of faith. Not mustard faith. Giant faith. Isaac was a willing participant in this. 

Genesis 22 is my favorite chapter in the Bible, because it is my example of how to live the Christian life by faith. It is the guiding principle. It is the example. It is the life changing example of having faith that ==following God’s commandment is better than disobeying him, even when it makes ZERO sense and you can’t see any positive outcome of obeying God==. Have faith in what God sees that you can’t see. Have faith in what God can think of that you can’t think of. I’d rather be an Abraham than a Peter. I am being tested. I will pass God’s test.

## American Airlines Fired Me

I thought lying about writing that comment at work would save me, but I heard “The truth will set you free.” I justified myself saying, “Yeah but that’s out of context. The truth is the gospel will set you free. Not telling the truth.” God commands us to tell the truth. Instead they investigated my private chats and I was fired for that. If it was only the comment, Stacey wouldn’t have fired me. She told me that.
