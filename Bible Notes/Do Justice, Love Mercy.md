> [!bible] [Micah 6:8 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Micah+6:8?translation=kjv)
> 8. He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to ==do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God==?

You do right, but don’t hold it against others when they don’t do right.

And when you do right and others don’t, it’s easy to get puffed up and holier than thou, but you are to be humble, not arrogant about it.
