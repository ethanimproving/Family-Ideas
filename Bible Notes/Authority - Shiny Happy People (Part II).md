[Authority - Shiny Happy People (Part II) - Pastor Jonathan Shelley](https://rumble.com/v2xm8vq-authority-shiny-happy-people-part-ii-pastor-jonathan-shelley-stedfast-bapti.html)

![[Authority Structure]]

Authority is the power or right to make orders, make decisions, and enforce obedience.

1. God
2. Bible

# Family unit
3. Husband
4. Wife
5. Children


God means ruler. He’s the one that makes the rules. He is the ultimate authority. Everyone answers to God. Joe Biden, Justin Trudeau, everyone. When both parents are present, the final say goes to dad. If he’s not present, the final say is up to the wife. We should do the will of those who have empowered us.
> [!Bible] [Ephesians 5:22 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Ephesians+5:22?translation=kjv)
> 22. Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.

> [!Bible] [Ephesians 6:1-2 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Ephesians+6:1-2?translation=kjv)
> 1. Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.
> 2. Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;)

# Church
3. Pastor
4. Evangelist
5. Deacon (servant)
6. Church 

Hebrews 13:17

**The pastor only has authority over the church**. He doesn’t have authority over the family. Only is gathering together. The songs we sing, what Bible we use, where we will do soul winning. If someone is disrupting the church service, he has authority to enforce obedience. He can call the ushers to deal with that problem. Pastors are supposed to be an example. It’s his goal to help people serve God better. To his detriment. To your embarrassment. Whatever is going to draw us closer to Christ is the right decision.
> [!Bible] [1 Peter 5:1 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/1Peter+5:1?translation=kjv)
> 1. The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:

Church makes you a better person. 
> [!Bible] [Titus 1:5 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Titus+1:5?translation=kjv)
> 5. For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:

> [!Bible] [Acts 20:17-26 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Acts+20:17-26?translation=kjv)
> 17. And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.
> 18. And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons,
> 19. Serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:
> 20. And how I kept back nothing that was profitable
unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house,
> 21. Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.
> 22. And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:
> 23. Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me.
> 24. But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.
> 25. And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.
> 26. Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I
am pure from the blood of all
men.


# Government

3. Constitution
4. Federal government
5. State government
6. Local government
7. Citizens

The doctrine of preeminence is from the Bible. **Just as the Pastor can’t tell you not to eat at McDonald’s, the government can’t tell you to inject your kids with vaccines**.
> [!Bible] [Romans 13:1-2 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Romans+13:1-2?translation=kjv)
> 1. Let every soul ==be subject unto the higher powers==. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.
> 2. Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.

Proverbs 29:

There are benefits to being under your parents authority. Bills, insurance, protection.
> [!Bible] [Psalms 91:1-6 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Psalm+91:1-6?translation=kjv)
> 1. He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
> 2. I will say of the LORD,
He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.
> 3. Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler,
and
 from the noisome pestilence.
> 4. He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth
shall be thy shield and buckler.
> 5. Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night;
nor for the arrow
that flieth by day;
> 6. Nor for the pestilence
that walketh in darkness;
nor for the destruction
that wasteth at noonday.


The people who hate authority the most are reprobates. They hate God and disobey their parents.
> [!Bible] [Romans 1:30 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Romans+1:30?translation=kjv)
> 30. Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, **disobedient to parents**,

**Children who curse their mother and father should be put to death. That would have solved 100% of our protestors**. Ted Cruz is a devil 10x worse than Joe Biden. I hate that God mocking reprobate wolf in sheep’s clothing.
> [!Bible] [Leviticus 20:9 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Leviticus+20:9?translation=kjv)
> 9. For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him.

> [!Bible] [Mark 7:10 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Mark+7:10?translation=kjv)
> 10. For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:


## Scope Of Authority

If the government says I have to paint my walls blue, that is outside the scope of their authority. **That is a family decision, not a government decision**. While government does have a proper authority over citizens, there is a biblical limit to that authority. So even if it wouldn't be a sin for me to paint my walls blue, there is no biblical precedent that gives government the authority over that decision. Their authority comes from God. To say their authority exceeds the scope that God ordained is to say its source is other than God.

### Recognition of God's ultimate authority

> [!Bible] [Romans 13:1 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Romans+13:1?translation=kjv)
> 1. Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: ==the powers that be are ordained of God==.

This verse suggests that ==government authorities derive their power from God== and should be acknowledged and respected.

### Punish evil

> [!Bible] [Romans 13:3-7 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Romans+13:3-7?translation=kjv)
> 3. For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:
> 4. For *he is the minister of God to thee for good*. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for **he beareth not the sword in vain**: for he is the minister of God, **a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil**.
> 5. Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.
> 6. For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God’s ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.
> 7. Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.

The Bible also emphasizes the role of government in promoting justice, protecting the weak, punishing wrongdoing, and serving the common good.

> [!Bible] [Psalms 82:3-4 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Psalm+82:3-4?translation=kjv)
> 3. Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy.
> 4. Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked.

> [!Bible] [Proverbs 14:34 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Proverbs+14:34?translation=kjv)
> 34. Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any people.

### Submission to God's laws

While governments have authority, there is also a recognition that they must operate within the framework of God's laws.

> [!Bible] [Acts 5:29 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Acts+5:29?translation=kjv)
> 29. Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, **We ought to obey God rather than men**.

This verse is popularly used to teach that we must obey government up to the point of sinning against God, such that they may control every other decision in our life except causing us to sin. However, nowhere in the Bible does it teach that. A government's proper authority is to enforce God's laws, not manmade laws.

### Defense and security

A lot of people say governments are responsible for protecting their territories and citizens from external threats. This includes the establishment of military forces or mechanisms to maintain peace and security within their jurisdictions. We do see David and his mighty men in the Old Testament. It is natural for a king to call for citizens to fight for the nation. While the Bible does not provide explicit verses that specifically outline the function of government in terms of defense and security, there are verses that can be interpreted to imply the responsibility of leaders to protect their nations.

### Taxes

> [!Bible] [Matthew 17:25-27 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Matthew+17:25-27?translation=kjv)
> 25. He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers?
> 26. Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, **Then are the children free**.
> 27. **Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them**, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee.

Jesus did not legitimize the government's ability to tax citizens. In fact, **Jesus said that is an illegitimate function of government**. ==He did not tell Peter to pay the tax because it was the proper and moral thing to do. He told Peter to pay the tax because he didn't want to get in trouble with them==. "Lest we should offend them." If it is not a moral principle, but a practical principle, I conclude that at a stop sign where there are no police men to offend, and no cars nearby, if it is safe, there is no moral obligation to stop. I don't see any scripture that gives the government authority to regulate driving standards. How a citizen drives is only punishable if it causes harm to another person. Otherwise it is not evil. **Evil means harm**. The only government role in Romans 13 is to punish evil, not to punish arbitrary rules that don't affect anybody.

### Privately Operated Toll Roads

Traffic laws are not a biblically ordained function of the government. While most people are in favor of using the government to build roads, there is no biblical argument that can be made that government's should do this. That ought to be a function of local businesses. If local government didn't do that, car companies would, or else toll companies would. 

There are places in the world where roads are built and operated by private companies rather than the government. This approach is known as privately funded or privately operated toll roads. In such cases, private companies or consortia are responsible for financing, constructing, maintaining, and operating the roads. These companies typically recover their investment and make a profit through toll collection from users of the road.

Examples of privately funded toll roads can be found in various countries. Here are a few notable examples:

United States: The United States has several privately operated toll roads. For instance, **the Indiana Toll Road, Chicago Skyway, and SR 91 Express Lanes** in California are operated by private companies through long-term lease agreements with government entities.

United Kingdom: The UK has a history of privately funded toll roads. The M6 Toll in England is a notable example, where a private company built and operates a bypass route as a tolled alternative to the congested M6 motorway.

Australia: Australia has seen the development of privately operated toll roads as well. Examples include CityLink in Melbourne and WestConnex in Sydney, where private companies have been involved in constructing and managing toll roads.

France: France has implemented several private toll roads, particularly through the Autoroutes system. Companies like Vinci and Eiffage operate and maintain these toll roads.

It's important to note that the extent of private involvement in road infrastructure can vary by country and region. Many roads worldwide are still built and managed by government agencies, while others may involve public-private partnerships (PPPs) where both government and private entities collaborate in road development.
