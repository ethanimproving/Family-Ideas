This may be a difficult task, yet be strong and of good courage because God will not fail you. 
1 Chronicles 28:20

# 1. In  Salvation

# 2. In the work that he has called you to do

We aren’t saved by our works, but God greatly desires us to do works that he chose for us. Your life isn’t going to go backwards because you start drawing closer to God. People who get plugged into church start having improvements in their life. 
Ephesians 2:8

There are many people in this room that you will not see 5 years from now. We’ve had 150 active members of this church that are not here now. Any of you that quit, at least you’re saved, because he will not fail thee. Even if you’re lazy and carnal, he will not fail thee. You first have a starter home. Then you get a bigger one because your family grows. 
Hebrews 13:

God will give you the desires of your heart. Covetousness is feeling that the desires of your heart are not met. He won't let us be weak and emaciated.  

## Even When You Fail God, God Will Not Fail You

Some people feel like God will help great Christians, but he won’t help me because I’m struggling in a particular area. If you’re saved you can say the Lord is my helper. If you cry out to God, he will not fail you. Samson was weak and a bad Christian, but when he humbled himself and cried out, God helped him. He slept with all kinds of harlots, but God was still with him. God will not fail Samson even though Samson failed God. 

None of our failures are due to God. It’s our lack of faith to trust him and take the steps he is ordering of you. 

# 3. In the battles that you have

In the moment sometimes you can’t see the future. The first RHPC has 3 sodomite protestors for every Baptist. Now they are 0. God gave us the victory. 
Deuteronomy 31:

# 4. In your old age

Sometimes in the Bible you just needed one guy to trust God by himself and then others would follow. Even in old age with dementia and Alzheimer’s God can take care of you. Follow his commandments diligently and God might preserve you from getting those mental illnesses.
Psalm 71:8-18

# 5. God will not fail you in his compassion. 

When you are backsliding, away from church, remember God’s mercies. God will not fail you even when you fail him. “Will you give me a fresh start today?”
Lamentations 3:22-23

God was always trying to offer them grace and offer them a fresh start. That’s why Jeremiah is so long. When he finally quits it’s rough. When he gets done with you, it’s over. They tempted him 10 times in the desert. 
Hebrews 4:14

Lying: when I confessed to pastor, I ended up okay. When I lied to manager, I was fired. Always tell the truth. 

# 6. In judgment 

Pastor preached against Robert Morris for 10 years, and now finally the world came down upon him hard. 

Zephaniah 3:5-7

Biden will be destroyed by God and the world will trash him. Ravi Zaharias was trashed only after he died, yet he was judged. Every secret thing came to light. They’ll be remembered as trash. Pastor Anderson will be remembered as a great man. 

Psalm 58:10-11

# 7. In treasure 

You have a treasure waiting for you in heaven. 
Luke 12:33-34
