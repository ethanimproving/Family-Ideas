[Skills To Pay The Bills](https://www.kjv1611only.com/video/02preaching/Sermons_Pastor_Shelley/Skills_To_Pay_The_Bills.mp4)

The Bible tells us the reason why Joseph was prosperous was because the Lord was with him. Don't just focus on tangible assets that we can add to the job. "I can type 60 words a minute." The most important thing is that the Lord is with you.
> [!Bible] [Genesis 39:2-3 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Genesis+39:2-3?translation=kjv)
> 2. And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.
> 3. And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand.

If the children of Israel follow God's commandments, he's going to prosper them. If you want to be prospered, it's tied to following God's commandments.  

When you're doing that which is godly, when you're withdrawing from the wicked people of the Lord, when you're delighting in the law of God, God is going to bless you.
> [!Bible] [Psalms 1:1-3 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/psalm+1:1-3?translation=kjv)
> 1. Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.
> 2. But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.
> 3. And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.
