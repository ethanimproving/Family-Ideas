That was needed.

Spring 2015 was home to a compilation of some of the most beautiful music that I've had the privilege of being ministered to by. The sequence of songs I put together is medicine for my soul when I'm feeling desensitized to my own sin. Sometimes they can not me down and hurt my soul. It can be suffocating. A sad face is pushed up to the air by crying. A guilty conscience is made to breathe again by music that is to theÂ soul what crying is to the heart. You feel something and it has to have an outlet. It has to pour out somewhere. It has to be expressed in some way. And music is so incredibly important because that's what it does for the sinner. That's what it does for the 14 year old boy who's been trying to overcome the urge to look at the nakedness of strange women on the internet for two years. That's what it does for the 18 year old man who has a toxic relationship with his family and keeps saying the wrong things in the wrong way.

I will always hold the New IFB in high esteem because of their work for the Lord, but there is one thing they lack: patient empathy. They seem to have a scheduled empathy. They have an empathy that talks, but not an empathy that listens. They have a quick empathy, but not a still empathy. And therefore they are desensitized to the beauty of emotion that is present in certain music.

There is of course inappropriate music that is to be rejected. But not all CCM is queer sounding and effeminate. Some of it is contrite and tender, and it softens the heart, and that's needed.
