I'm tired of all the Christian songs about shame that are embraced by youth obviously feeling shame because of pornography. There's a unique level of self-directed guilt, shame, disgust, and embarrassment that Christians think they experience because of their Christianity. The world feels gross when they look at porn. It's called post nut clarity. There's nothing religious or spiritual about it. It's not even an ethical issue. It's a self issue.
