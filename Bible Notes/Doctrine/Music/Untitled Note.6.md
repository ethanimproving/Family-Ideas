A big shift I've noticed in worship music from 500-2004 to 2010 is the old songs declared the majesty and power and holiness of God, and songs after 2010 are mostly about his love as it relates to me (Your Love Never Fails, He Loves Us), what I'm going to do (Oceans), etc. It's focused on me, not God.

Older songs had the church involved too. "We'll work till Jesus comes,"  but it was always corporate. "We," not, "I." I think that's a reflection about how our prayer lives today have become dominantly personal and individualized. It's all about our unique relationship with God, and so we write songs that are inappropriate for corporate worship because it requires a degree of vulnerability and brokenness and self-encouragement that ought to remain composed in the house of God. The Bible says in Nehemiah 8 to put away your greif because it's a holy day. Save your heart wrenching confessions for Monday, but when we're celebrating the Lord Jesus Christ on Sundays, put away your sadness and praise God, nothing hindering. It's our holy day, our weekly holiday that we set aside for him. The joy of the Lord is your strength.

But today it's all about being softened by music, and keeping us in a state of confession, and remembrance of our sin, and how God loves us anyway. The focus is on us. And I think that's a big mistake that will have insurmountable consequences in the worship of the next generation. And this generation.
