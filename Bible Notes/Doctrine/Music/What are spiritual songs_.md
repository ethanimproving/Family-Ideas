I think it's a mistake for Christians to automatically assume that when Paul said "spiritual songs," he was talking about Chris Tomlin. He was talking about David Crowder. Phil Wickem. We need to be careful in understanding what it means, and it surprises me how carelessly we throw taht around and say, "See? New song. There are no restrictions on how God wants praise to be offered." You're right. God doesn't give us a big list of restrictions about how not to do music. Instead he gives us a model of how he does want it done. There are at least 3.Â  In Spirit and in Truth, in Psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, and in skillfully with a new song. We know the psalms, most of us don't sing it. We know what hymns are. Most churches don't sing it. (And by the way, don't tell me our modern hymns were the old equivalent of rock and roll. We're not making the argument from cultural taste. We're making the argument from the intrinsic qualities of music over and against what the Bible commands.)

I didn't start liking hymns until after I had graduated college. They were meaningful to me, because I was used to the very stirring and emotional music that my generation put forth. And the fact that I could not be stirred by Be Thou My Vision, but Our God and Canons and How He Loves Us moved me, shows me that ==it was the music that stirred me, not my affections for the Lord. Because the content of the old hymns are far superior in describing our God and his counsel, and imbued with his word than new songs. In other words we are in a carnal digression.== You know what filled with the Spirit means? filled with the words of God. I'm sorry, quoting Ruth and adapting it to God doesn't count. That doesn't teach or affirm a truth from God's word. So no, they aren't spiritual. Because they aren't affirming truths from God's word. They're affirming Christian adages and sermons and such. We are a T'shirt and bumper sticker generation, and CCM fits right in. And we need to be mindful about the way God wants music done, not just the words. We can quote a Bible verse in a whiny complaining tone, and that betrays the point. Serve the Lord with gladness or tone serve him at all. We need to worship in truth. The music cannot betray the words, or it isn't in truth. It's in manipulation. How many modern songs thrive with emotional manipulation? Old hymns don't do that the way new songs do. To a saved grown Christian, they stir the soul. To a punk rock kids who loves carnal music, they do nothing. And I'm speaking very much from experience. I remember youth group. I remember the songs. They moved me. They stirred me. But looking back, there is a fine line of stirring emotions and manipulating them to the surface. And all I'm saying is that we need to be careful about which side of the aisle many of these songs are on. Awesome God is great. I would sing it. But even though it's true, and powerful, it doesn't allude to scripture. It takes an overarching feeling. I just love it when I'm singing a hymn, and every verse a Bible verse comes to mind. And I'm reminded of it. That's what songs should be for. Not just wracking your mind to try and come up with a verse to support what you're singing, but the singing itself reminds you of the verse. You can go to Isaiah 40 and Job 30 and say, "Aha, this is true." But it doesn't remind me of it. It's not close enough.

For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. Romans 8:6

Do you think there's no such thing as carnal music? Music? ...instrumentation?

For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things. Romans 15:27

Here is a pretty good definition of "spiritual" in 1 Cor. 2:13: "Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual." In other words, forget the cute adages, let's sing from the Bible. "One Thing Remains" is from Romans 8:36, but it totally betrays the spirit of that passage. This is a promise. A rejoicing. Not a comfort for someone who's going through a breakup, or feeling guilty about sin.

And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ. 1 Corinthians 3:1
Notice carnal is correlated with being a babe in Christ, not with being an unbeliever. In other words, yes, there are things that babes in Christ do for the Lord that are carnal.

1 Corinthians 14:37 If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord.

What does spiritual mean except filled with the words of God?

1 Corinthians 15

46 Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.

47 The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven.

Natural: of the earth.
Spiritual: from heaven.

Galatians 6:1 Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.
Spirit of meekness.

Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to \[you would expect him to say "each other"\] the Lord; Pause right here. to the Lord? Speak to each other by singing to the Lord? A lot of people separate these out like they are two separate commands because they are separate participles. But "singing" implies, "This is how you do it." Otherwise it would be written, "and sing to the Lord." But that's not how it goes. It's the same command. The way we speak to each other in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs is by singing to the Lord. And I take "from the heart" therefore to mean in truth. Some people think that means, "Do it silently." I don't see that. I see, "Don't just honor me with your lips. Do it in your heart. Do it truthfully." Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ; again, an elaboration, not a separation. "Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God." Not I'm confused. All of these things are coupled together in being filled with the spirit.

Colossians 1:9 For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;

Colossians 3:16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.

One of the ways we admonish one another is in corporate worship, by the content of what we're singing. That doesn't happen when the only thing we sing is, "He loves us / Oh how he loves us." In order for us to do the first part with the second part, our hymns and spiritual songs need to be indwelled by the words of Christ.

1 Peter 2:5 Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.

Notice how spiritual is coupled with, "Acceptable to God." That implies there's a way to do sacrifice that isn't acceptable. And we see that in the Bible. Aaron's son's offered strange fire and God killed them. He killed them for their worship. Why? Because it wan't acceptable. I submit that neither is CCM.
