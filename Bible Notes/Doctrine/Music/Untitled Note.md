Music has an affect on the way that you feel,Â  and in many cases worldly music invokes feelings that appeal to my ego and pride. It puts me in a self oriented mindset. And that feels good immediately, to feel cool or dominant or powerful, but inevitably self directed thinking results in depression. If you spend all your time looking into the mirror you will become unhappy with yourself. And music does that to me.
