Listening is worldlyÂ music is a very wicked sin. There's not enough clear preaching on this that makes it unequivocal from the Bible, but the Bible is clear, and we can use the Bible to gauge what music is pure and right against what music we need to avoid. Because there are songs that will empower the flesh. And what do we call that? A mind altering stimulus. It influences you to act in wicked ways you normally wouldn't act in. It feeds your mind with wicked thoughts of self glorification, or even of obscene things which are shameful to speak of. But we need to preach against wicked, worldly, secular music.
