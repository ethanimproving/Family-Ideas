Don't judge people too harshly when they listen to bad music. Remember how that when you were a babe in Christ, you also exercised the same manner of taste in listening to whatever you desired? And how that the pleasures of music were never far from your devices? But you listened not only to the music of unsober Christians, but the music of the unrighteous world. Stand firm for right music, rebuke wrong music, but do it in a spirit of gentleness and meekness until they know better, and loose all begrudging thoughts of mind when you hear them listening to the music you learned to reject.
