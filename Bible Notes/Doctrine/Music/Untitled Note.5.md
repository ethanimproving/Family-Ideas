It's amazing to me how Christians are so shallow these days they embrace music that was written by the heart of a total unbeliever posing as worship to God. Spirit and truth? "It wasn't true to them, but it was true to me. I meant it even if he didn't." If the depth of your worshop to God is more powerfully expressed by someone who is blind, who doesn't know God, who can't see God because of the hardness of his heart, then it is by solid IFB preaching and hymns, what spirit and truth do you really have?

"Well he's a talented artist and lyric writer." That goes to show your perception of the Holy Ghost is perfectly substituted by emotional music and poetry. Substituted by, not channeled through. 

People listen to Drops In The Ocean and are absolutely stirred. "If you want to know how far my love can go / look at my hands, look at my side." So moving. But Jesus is not impressed. Jesus said this song is evil.

Matthew 12:34-35
O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.

A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.

Drops In The Ocean is the product of evil treasure. And the Christian world couldn't tell? The IFB crowd could tell. But they're the same people that Christians say are unloving and strict. But how much do you love God when you know him so little that you use an evil song to worship him with?

Why I didn't like that song before he said he was an unbeliever: it makes forgiveness look free and sin look insignificant. That's one of the things that drove this man away from the faith in his personal statement on Instagram. "My parents taught me to forgive, and there's no killing in that scenario.... How can a loving God send people to hell?"

Shame is to the soul what pain is to the body. Don't numb it. Heal. Don't numb it with emotional music. Heal.

I used to say, "Sometimes in our attempt to make forgiveness look glorious we actually put a shadow over it. Forgiveness is not glorious because our sins weren't a big deal. Forgiveness isn't glorious because it comes for free. A good judge doesn't forgive. 

Proverbs 17:15
He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just,
even they both are abomination to the LORD."

What hawk Nelson is missing in his analogy that his forgiveness is free, so why shouldn't God's be, is that the reason our forgiveness is free is because vengeance belongs to the Lord. He is the judge, we are not. He will avenge, you have mercy. He is God, you are not. Even Jesus Christ himself committed himself to God.

The glorious nature of the gospel is that forgiveness isn’t free. Jesus paid it all. If you don't seek him as Savior, you don't seek him at all.

For the record, you don't have to be an unbeliever to be unsettled that praying seems like a performing art. Jesus said the same thing about the religious people that prayed long prayers to be seen of men in his day. It was a performing art then and it continues to be a performing art now.
