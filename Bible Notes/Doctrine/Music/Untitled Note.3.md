There is nothing that has had a more powerful influence on afflicting my mind with depression than music. It used to be that I wasn't allowed to listen to secular music or even Christian Rock. I was safeguarded from those things as a child, and I fought against those rules like a civil rights activist. After enough pushing and defiance, our protection faded and I began withholding no music that was pleasurable to me. Now I'm listening to "I'm a mess, I'm a loser / I'm a hater, I'm a user / I'm a mess for your love, it ain't new / I'm obsessed, I'm embarrassed / I don't trust no one around us / I'm a mess for your love, it ain't new." I've started listening to the songs I listened to as a child, and it was like the birth of a new day with fresh air and sunlight to dry up all the snot from these songs I've been congesting myself with. I mean it was powerful. The trumpets, the choir, the strength of their voices, it was like a Disney World musical for Christians. Just beautiful and majestic. My depression went fleeting away. But my desire for imprisoning music didn't. After I started listening to the worldly songs it's amazing how quickly my negative feelings turned back on like a TV channel. And the same goes for Christian rap and Christian so-called worship from modern artists. The music itself gave me bad feelings, not triumphant feelings.

It's time for me to make the decision that I'm only going to allow myself to listen to love songs 5% of the time. Because I do think there's a place for it. The problem is when I let it dominate my desire. It's like when you're on the operating table and they give you a painkiller. It's okay for that situation, but don't let yourself get addicted to it. And I've let myself get addicted to songs that make me wallow in the numb, self-pitying feeling that your feel after a breakup. I love that feeling. I don't know why. It's a bad feeling. But it feels right. And it's time to rebuke it and say, "No, Ethan, you're not defeated, you're not just rejected and a loser, you're a child of the High God who expects you to run the race set before you." Sometimes the stress of having said something wrong that you regret is enough that the only appropriate response is to say to yourself, "You suck. I hate myself." And that makes the stress go down, because it kills the need to do anything about it. I don't have to plan a course of correction if I accept that I suck. I messed up because I suck, and I'm just going to live with it.

It's like if I spilled soda on my car. I can either live with the thoughts of

1. Regret: "Oh man, I messed up. I should have had a water, or opened it out there."
2. Resolution: "I need to get paper towels and dry this, and then I'm going to be late for church."

Or you can be lazy and just leave it there and say, "The reason it happened is because I suck. I'm not even going to church now. I'm going to wallow in the mess I made."

Music can make you lazy like that.
