[How Great Thou Art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=69&v=2ly4FptrScQ&t=3m21s)Â by Shane & Shane is just terrible. Why in the world would you use that whiney tone to declare the greatness of God? Look, it's fine if you want to sing about affliction, and trials and tribulations, and in "Lord of Hosts," that's perfectly appropriate, but that tone completely betrays the worship of this song. It isn't just artistic liberty. I'm mad about this. This is strange fire before the Lord. You don't get to make love to the microphone and sound like this every song.

[Come Thou Fount (Above All Else)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ0t3l1b1e8). I used to sing this way. I used to get into the moment. And I can tell you, somewhere at the bottom of my mind I had a phantom girl that I was performing for. I was showing her my humble side, my tender side so that she would think I'm more godly. Displaying my contriteness. Well isn't that interesting? Displaying contriteness about how great God is? That's absolutely wrong. And I will not stand for it, and I won't stand for people who sing to glorify their own pitiful voices either. There's a bunch of Herods walking around today.

Why do you have to hyper-sexualize your voice in all of these songs? If you want to do your own thing, fine, but why mess up these wonderful old-time hymns with your blue-light, self-focused, misfitted emotion? I just want to grab them and shake them and say, "Sing like a man!"

Anna, if you want to listen to music while I'm working, I really don't mind, but listen to something a little more godly, like th2c by Krewlla. Shane & Shane's songs are an abomination to me. Even secular music isn't sung with the measure of grossness these artists employ in their stupid songs.
