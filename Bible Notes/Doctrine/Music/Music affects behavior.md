"Let me write the songs of a nation, I don't care who writes its laws."

Behavior is not now nor ever will be dictated finally by what people *can* and can't do. Behavior is ultimately decided by what people *do* and don't do. Behavior comes from your character and your nature, and laws don't affect that core being of who you are. Music does. ==Music affects us, and morphs our desires, and has the power to determine our attitudes and moods==. That's powerful. More powerful than a list of rules ever will be. Who cares what's allowed and not allowed? I'm more concerned with what people do. And music affects that.
