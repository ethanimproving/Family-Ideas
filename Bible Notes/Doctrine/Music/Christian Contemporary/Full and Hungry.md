I want to be careful what I withhold from people as a NIFB. Because to the hungry soul, every bitter thing is sweet. The Christian Contemporary Music I'm preaching against may be the thing that's keeping them from going off the cliff into secular music and worldly living. It may be the activation energy that germinates their spirit, and I'm taking it away. Piper may be the preaching that's stirring their affections for God, and making them want to read the Bible. Unless it's very clear that these alternatives Christian worship styles are strange fire before the Lord, I don't think it's wise to take it away from believers at every walk of life. They may be depending on it. I couldn't figure out why I was even more sinful after going to Stedfast. I fought against secular music less. I watched more TV. I still used PMO. It wasn't because of the good doctrine they added. It was because the good things they took away that left me hungry. I'm not satisfied with the hardness of the hymns. They're cheerful and great, but that's only half of the emotions that I need a song for. I have emotions all accross the spectrum, and I am very helped by music that comunes with my slow sense of awe, and my sad response to my sin.
