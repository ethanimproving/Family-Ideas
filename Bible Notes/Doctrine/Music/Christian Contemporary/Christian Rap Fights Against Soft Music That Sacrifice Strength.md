Christian rap affords you the ability to preach to yourself without becoming weak and taken advantage of. It affords you the ability to pursue holiness without pity or nice guy syndrome. IÂ hate it when girls talk to me because they feel bad for me. I'm a victim of pity. I'm a victim of sympathy. Christian rap is where I go when I want to feel good about my choices to live for God. It's strong. There's no repentance. There's no second thought about following Christ. Take it or leave it.

There is a pervasive line of thought in popular Christendom that apologizing for everything is godly, and softening yourself to your own faults towards others is godly, and the display of that softening is essential for the Christian life. And therefore when a girl loses interest in me, I don't have any categories to brush it off my shoulders. I don't have any hardness of heart. I don't have any carelessness. ==Christian rap provides me with a feeling of carelessness about being rejected==. It hardens my heart against self-pity. "She didn't like me? Bye bye. I'm following Christ." Instead of, "I will wait on the Lord. I'm hurt, but I trust God." I don't have to be hurt. I don't have to feel second class, like only loser girls will want a loser Christian guy.
