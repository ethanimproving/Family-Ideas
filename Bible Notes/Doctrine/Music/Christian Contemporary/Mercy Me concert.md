One of the common themes of CCM is that songs are birthed out of tragedy. They stand on stage and without fail say how they don't have it all together, and then credit a song to everybody who's had a bad day. In the Bible it says that singing is for joy, not sorrow. It says if you sing to a heavy heart, that's not right. Music isn't supposed to be abused the way it is to express our sadness. Were supposed to cry and grieve and mourn, and people identify so strongly with sad songs, but I don't believe it's biblical.
