"[Dear Mr. Christian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Uf8F7jIkYc)." Who is that targeted at? Christian fundamentalists. It's empowering unvelievers to hate the best Christians Christianity has to offer. The people who are the most faithful Christians in the world are the target of Lecrae's reproach. He doesn't have a point. Hes trying to make Christians afraid to stand firm for the things of God. Afraid to tell people they're sinners. Well that's funny, because the Holy Spirit testifies in the hearts of unbelievers of sin, righteousness, and the coming judgment. And we're the lights of the world. But men love darkness because light exposes their sin.

What's Lecrae's point? He's saying that fundamentalists didn't compel him growing up, and it was a kind, tender, effeminate no judgment safe space that made him sign up for Christianity. But that version of Christianity isn't Christianity at all. Lecrae is not saved. He doesn't know the gospel. He knows Christian culture. He knows Christian language, Christian products, Christian wisdom and adages, but he does not know Christ. And he mocks the very people who are doing the most for Christ. He's a rebellious person. And he's an enemy of the cross, trying to convert people from "judgmental Christianity" to his loose, careless, no gospel, take up your own cross and thou shalt be saved version of Christianity. He's wicked. And exceedingly wicked. I don't like the song.
