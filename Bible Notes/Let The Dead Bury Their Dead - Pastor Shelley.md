[Whatever, Whenever - Pastor Jonathan Shelley](https://www.youtube.com/live/1QSIGvYxy9o?&t=1033)

We're supposed to do **whatever** he wants, and **whenever** he wants.

- Whatever
- Whenever

Am I going to choose Jesus right now, or am I going to choose something else?

# Do What Only You Can Do

The dead are the spiritually dead (the unsaved). Your brothers and sisters will take care of the body. Let the spiritually dead worry about this world, and you worry about the spiritual world. Don’t get bogged down doing dead works. Let the dead build your Obsidian plug-ins. You do things only you can do.

This is like me sharpening pencils as the senior on my team. I’m a skilled programmer. You’re wasting my skills by assigning me to a menial task.

What is the payoff of my labor? How long will it be important? After I die, all the knowledge I stored in Obsidian [[Are plug-ins worth writing|will be lost]]. Catastrophe. Look at Evernote note.

Jesus was willing to do whatever, whenever. If this is what you want me to do, I’ll do it. 
> [!Bible] [Matthew 26:39 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Matthew+26:39?translation=kjv)
> 39. And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.


Not what I will, but what thou wilt.
> [!Bible] [Mark 14:36 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Mark+14:36?translation=kjv)
> 36. And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.


We’re getting this emphasis repeated a lot in the Bible.
> [!Bible] [Luke 22:42 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Luke+22:42?translation=kjv)
> 42. Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.


What church does God want me to go to? What Bible does God want me to read?

> [!Bible] [Matthew 26:9 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Matthew+26:9?translation=kjv)
> 9. For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.


> [!Bible] [Luke 11:2 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Luke+11:2?translation=kjv)
> 2. And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth.


“If it fits my dreams then I’ll do it.” No. When I make a judgment, I don’t consult myself. I just read what the Bible says, and that is my judgment.
> [!Bible] [John 5:30 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/John+5:30?translation=kjv)
> 30. I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.


It only matters what God thinks. He is our boss. Why would you call Jesus your boss and not treat him like your boss?
> [!Bible] [Luke 6:46 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Luke+6:46?translation=kjv)
> 46. And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?


# 1. Read the Bible

Delight in doing whatever God wants whenever God wants. Have pleasure in it. Have the right attitude. We may not always know what God wants us to do, so we ask him.
Psalm 40:7, 143:10

# 2. Don't Count The Cost

It shows how much that God loves us that he would be willing to sacrifice his son. How many people would rise up early to do it? He didn’t take his time. Whatever, whenever. 
Genesis 22:1-4

How many people are missing out on the blessing of God because of disobedience? How many great spiritual journeys has God laid out for you that you missed out on because of disobedience?

I want to write a song about throwing off the shackles of unbelief in the Christian walk. Lack of Faith in God. There’s so much freedom when  you [don’t count the cost](https://youtu.be/TYo1bWqdXTQ). Your life is free from stress, and God takes care of you always. And he has better things in store than you could achieve by yourself. It’s a win-win-win situation when we do whatever whenever.

There is a cost sometimes. What will your attitude be like? It’s not like it’s not going to hurt. It is going to hurt.
> [!Bible] [Judges 11:3 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Judges+11:3?translation=kjv)
> 3. Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and went out with him.

> [!Bible] [Judges 11:35-36 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Judges+11:35-36?translation=kjv)
> 35. And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go back.
> 36. And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the LORD, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies, even of the children of Ammon.


Your life stinks when you don’t serve God. It’s a shipwreck. It’s a blunder. Jonah. He picked plan B because he was afraid, and it was way worse. It’s always way worse.

# 3. Whatever, Whenever, and I'm delighted to do it

You should apply this attitude to your boss at work. Your attitude should be to your boss, “Whatever, whenever, and I’m delighted to do it.”
> [!Bible] [Titus 2:9-10 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Titus+2:9-10?translation=kjv)
> 9. Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again;
> 10. Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.

DataviewJs query to keep track of which sermons to listen to.

The Bible says to give all your bosses honor. You represent Christ poorly when you disrespect your boss. And if he’s saved, even more so.
> [!Bible] [1 Timothy 6:1-5 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/1Timothy+6:1-5?translation=kjv)
> 1. Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.
> 2. And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them,  because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort.
> 3. If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;
> 4. He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,
> 5. Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself.

David’s soldiers do whatever whenever. They were excited to do it. 
> [!Bible] [2 Samuel 23:15-16 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/2Samuel+23:15-16?translation=kjv)
> 15. And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!
> 16. And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the LORD.


Children should obey their parents whatever whenever.
> [!Bible] [Ephesians 6:1 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Ephesians+6:1?translation=kjv)
> 1. Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.


Wives are supposed to do everything that their husbands say. The Bible says “As unto the Lord.” The same way you would submit to your boss, or to God, you should submit to your husband. Unless your husband says to do something sinful, submit to God over him. He isn’t submitting to his authority (God) in that instance.
> [!Bible] [Ephesians 5:22-24 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Ephesians+5:22-24?translation=kjv)
> 22. Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.
> 23. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.
> 24. Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.


# Freedom Is The Right Rules

Real freedom is to do whatever God wants when God wants it. A fish is only free when it’s in the after. It was a rule. Freedom isn’t the absence of rules, but the right rule.
> [!Bible] [John 2:5 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/John+2:5?translation=kjv)
> 5. His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.


Labor by Paris Paloma:
Who tends the orchards?
Who fixes up the gables?
Emotional torture... insert lyrics.

She’s complaining about serving him dinner. The dad teaches the daughter and she obeys, and the song says that’s emotional torture.

What a foolish attitude to bite the hands that feeds it. 
> [!Bible] [Proverbs 9:1-2 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Proverbs+9:1-2?translation=kjv)
> 1. Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars:
> 2. She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table.


Nobody likes old bitter hags.
> [!Bible] [Leviticus 19:29 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Leviticus+19:29?translation=kjv)
> 29. Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore; lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.


Shortsighted women are called silly women, watching Tik Tok videos all day, instead of getting married, beating children, and guiding the house. Men are the rulers of the house, but women are leaders of the house. That’s what guide means.
> [!Bible] [1 Timothy 5:14 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/1Timothy+5:14?translation=kjv)
> 14. I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.


> [!Bible] [Romans 6:16 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Romans+6:16?translation=kjv)
> 16. Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?
