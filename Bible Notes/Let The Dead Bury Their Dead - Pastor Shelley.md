[Whatever, Whenever - Pastor Jonathan Shelley](https://www.youtube.com/live/1QSIGvYxy9o?&t=1033)

We're supposed to do **whatever** he wants, and **whenever** he wants.

- Whatever
- Whenever

Am I going to choose Jesus right now, or am I going to choose something else?

# Do What Only You Can Do

The dead are the spiritually dead (the unsaved). Your brothers and sisters will take care of the body. Let the spiritually dead worry about this world, and you worry about the spiritual world. Don’t get bogged down doing dead works. Let the dead build your Obsidian plug-ins. You do things only you can do.

This is like me sharpening pencils as the senior on my team. I’m a skilled programmer. You’re wasting my skills my assigning me to a menial task.

What is the payoff of my labor? How long will it be important? After I die, all the knowledge I stored in Obsidian [[Are plug-ins worth writing|will be lost]]. Catastrophe. Look at Evernote note.

Jesus was willing to do whatever, whenever. If this is what you want me to do, I’ll do it. 
Matthew 26:39

Not what I will, but what thou wilt.
Mark 14:36

We’re getting this emphasis repeated a lot in the Bible.
Luke 22:42

What church does God want me to go to? What Bible does Fox want me to read?

Matthew 26:9

Luke 11:2

“If it fits my dreams then I’ll do it.” No. When I make a judgment, I don’t consult myself. I just read what the Bible says, and that is my judgment.
John 5:30

It only matters what God thinks. He is our boss. Why would you call Jesus your boss and not treat him like your boss?
Luke 6:46

# 1. Read the Bible

Delight in doing whatever God wants whenever God wants. Have pleasure in it. Have the right attitude. We may not always know what God wants us to do, so we ask him.
Psalm 40:7, 143:10

# 2. Don't Count The Cost

It shows how much that God loves us that he would be willing to sacrifice his son. How many people would rise up early to do it? He didn’t take his time. Whatever, whenever. 
Genesis 22:1-4

How many people are missing out on the blessing of God because of disobedience? How many great spiritual journeys has God laid out for you that you missed out on because of disobedience?

I want to write a song about throwing off the shackles of unbelief in the Christian walk. Lack of Faith in God. There’s so much freedom when  you [don’t count the cost](https://youtu.be/TYo1bWqdXTQ). Your life is free from **stress, and God takes care of you always. And he has better things in store than you could achieve by yourself. It’s a win-win-win situation when we do whatever whenever.

There is a cost sometimes. What will your attitude be like? It’s not like it’s not going to hurt. It is going to hurt.
Judges 11:31, 35-36

Your life stinks when you don’t serve God. It’s a shipwreck. It’s a blunder. Jonah. He picked plan B because he was afraid, and it was way worse. It’s always way worse.

# 3. Whatever, Whenever, and I'm delighted to do it

You should apply this attitude to your boss at work. Your attitude should be to your boss, “Whatever, whenever, and I’m delighted to do it.”
Titus 2:9-10

[[Coming In Late]]
[[Skills To Pay The Bills]]
Scripture in frontmatter as a list in each sermon note.
DataviewJs query to keep track of which sermons to listen to.

The Bible says to give all your bosses honor. You represent Christ poorly when you disrespect your boss. And if he’s saved, even more so.
1 Timothy 6:1-5

David’s soldiers do whatever whenever. They were excited to do it. 
2 Samuel 23:15-16

Children should obey their parents whatever whenever.
Ephesians 6:1

Wives are supposed to do everything that their husbands say. The Bible says “As unto the Lord.” The same way you would submit to your boss, or to God, you should submit to your husband. Unless your husband says to do something sinful, submit to God over him. He isn’t submitting to his authority (God) in that instance.
Ephesians 5:22-24

# Freedom Is The Right Rules

Real freedom is to do whatever God wants when God wants it. A fish is only free when it’s in the after. It was a rule. Freedom isn’t the absence of rules, but the right rule.
John 2:5

Labor by Paris Paloma:
Who tends the orchards?
Who fixes up the gables?
Emotional torture... insert lyrics.

She’s complaining about serving him dinner. The dad teaches the daughter and she obeys, and the song says that’s emotional torture.

What a foolish attitude to bite the hands that feeds it. 
Proverbs 9:1-2

Nobody likes old bitter hags.
Leviticus 19:29

Shortsighted women are called silly women, watching Tik Tok videos all day, instead of getting married, beating children, and guiding the house. Men are the rulers of the house, but women are leaders of the house. That’s what guide means.
1 Timothy 5:14

Romans 6:16
