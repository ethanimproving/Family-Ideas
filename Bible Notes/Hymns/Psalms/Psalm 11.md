> [!Bible] [Psalms 11:1-7 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Psalm+11:1-7?translation=kjv)
> 1. In the LORD put I my trust: How say ye to my soul, Flee as
 a bird to your mountain?
> 2. For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart.
> 3. If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?
> 4. The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORDâ€™S throne
is  in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.
> 5. The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.
> 6. Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup.
> 7. For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright.
