Who shall ascend unto your place,
Great God, and dwell before your face?
Ones who will mind your heavenly way,
and humbly walk with you each day.
Their hands are pure, their hearts are clean,
their lips shall speak the things they mean;
no slanders dwell upon the tongue;
they will not do a neighbor wrong.
They love their enemies, they pray
for those that curse them to their face;
do unto others still the same
as they would hope or wish from them.
Firm to their vows they ever stood,
and always make a promise good.
Yet when their holiest works are done,
they still depend on grace alone.
