> [!Bible] [Psalms 126:1-6 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Psalm+126:1-6?translation=kjv)
> 1. When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream.
> 2. Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great things for them.
> 3. The LORD hath done great things for us;
whereof we are glad.
> 4. Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south.
> 5. They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.
> 6. He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.
