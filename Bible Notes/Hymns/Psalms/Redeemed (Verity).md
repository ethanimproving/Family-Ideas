In thee, O Lord, I put my trust,
Sham'd never let me be;
Accordingly as thou art just
Do thou deliver me.

Bow down to me thine ear with speed,
Let me deliverance have,
My rock of strength, and house of fence,
O be thou me to save.

Because a rock thou me unto
And fortress mine wilt be:
Therefore for thy name sake, O do
Thou lead and guide thou me.

O pull thou me out of the net,
Which to ensnare me they
Full privily for me have set:
Because thou art my stay.

Into thy hands my spirit I
Reposing do commit;
Jehovah God of verity,
Thou hast redeemed it.

Who lying vanities embrace,
Such men have I abhorr'd;
But as for me, I wholly place
My trust upon the Lord.

I in thy mercies will be glad,
And joy, because that thou
Didst view my straits, in anguish sad
My soul thou diddest know.

And thou hast not enclosed me
Within the enemies hand:
But in the place of liberty
Thou mad'st my feet to stand.
[2]

O Lord, because distress'd am I,
In mercy send relief!
My soul, my belly, and mine eye,
Consumed are with grief.
Because my life with sorrow quails,
With sighs my years decay:
And for my sins my vigour fails,
My bones do pine away.
To all my foes a scorn am I,
Chiefly my nieghbours to.
A fear to friends, they that me spie
Without, did flee me fro.
I as a dead man am forgot,
That's out of memory;
And like unto a broken pot,
Ev'n such an one am I.
Because that I of all the rout
The slandering did hear:
On every side me round about
There was a trembling fear.
While as that they against me did
Together council take,
They craftily have purposed,
My life away to make.
But O Jehovah, upon thee
My confidence doth stand?
I said thou art a God to me.
My times are in thy hand;
From the hands of mine enemies
Do thou deliver me,
And from the hand of them likewise
That my pursuers be
[3]
Thy countenance to shine upon,
Thy servant do thou make:
O give to me salvation,
Ev'n for thy mercies sake.
O Lord, let me not be asham'd,
For call'd on thee I have:
O let the wicked men be sham'd,
And silent in the grave.
Let lying lips be silenced;
'Gainst him that is upright,
That do such grievous speeches spread
In pride and in despite.
Oh how great good hast thou in store
Laid up, and wrought for them,
Who fear and trust in thee before
The sons of earthly men!

Thou in the secret of thy face
Shalt hide them from man's pride,
From strive of tongues in covert place
Thou shalt them safely hide.

let Jehovah blessed be,
Because he hath made known
His kindness wonderful to me,
Within a fenced town.

For I in haste said, i am cast
Out from before thine eyes;
My suit for grace yet heard thou hast,
When I to thee did cry.

O love the Lord all ye his saints,
the faithful he doth guard,
But he unto proud doers grants
A plentiful reward.

See that encouraged you be,
And let your heart wax strong,
All whosoever hopefully
Do for Jehovah long.
