I have heard of a land
On the faraway strand,
’Tis a beautiful home of the soul;
Built by Jesus on high,
There we never shall die,
’Tis a land where we never grow old.

*Never grow old,
Where we'll never grow old,
In a land where we’ll never grow old;
Never grow old,
Where we'll never grow old,
In a land where we’ll never grow old.*

In that beautiful home
Where we’ll nevermore roam,
We shall be in the sweet by and by;
Happy praise to the King
Through eternity sing,
’Tis a land where we never shall die. [Refrain]

When our work here is done
And the life crown is won,
And our troubles and trials are o’er,
All our sorrows will end,
And our voices will blend
With the loved ones who’ve gone on before. [Refrain]
