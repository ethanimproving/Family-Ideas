There's a royal banner given for display
To the soldiers of the King;
As an ensign fair we lift it up today,
While as ransomed ones we sing.

*Marching on, marching on,
For Christ count ev'rything but loss!
And to crown Him King,
toil and sing 'Neath the banner of the cross!*

Though the foe may rage and gather as the flood,
Let the standard be displayed;
And beneath its folds, as soldiers of the Lord,
For the truth be not dismayed!
[Chorus]

Over land and sea, wherever man may dwell,
Make the glorious tidings known;
Of the crimson banner now the story tell,
While the Lord shall claim His own!
[Chorus]

When the glory dawns 'tis drawing very near--
It is hast'ning day by day;
Then before our King the foe shall disappear,
And the cross the world shall sway!
[Chorus]
