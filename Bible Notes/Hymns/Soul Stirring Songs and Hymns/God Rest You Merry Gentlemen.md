God rest you merry, gentlemen,
let nothing you dismay;
remember Christ, our Savior
was born on Christmas Day
to save us all from Satan's pow'r
when we were gone astray.

*O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy.*

From God our heav'nly Father
a blessed angel came
and unto certain shepherds
brought tidings of the same,
how that in Bethlehem was born
the son of God by name. [Refrain]

""Fear not,"" then said the angel,
""let nothing you affright;
this day is born a Savior,
the true and radiant light,
to free all those who trust in him
from Satan's pow'r and might."" [Refrain]

Now to the Lord sing praises,
all you within this place,
and in true love and fellowship
each other now embrace;
this holy tide of Christmas
is filled with heav'nly grace. [Refrain]
