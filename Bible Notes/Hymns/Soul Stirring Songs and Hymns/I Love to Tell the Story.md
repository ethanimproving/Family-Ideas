I love to tell the story
of unseen things above,
of Jesus and his glory,
of Jesus and his love.
I love to tell the story
because I know it's true;
it satisfies my longings
as nothing else can do.

*I love to tell the story;
'twill be my theme in glory
to tell the old, old story
of Jesus and his love.*

[A seasonal stanza may be sung.]

I love to tell the story,
for those who know it best
seem hungering and thirsting
to hear it like the rest.
And when in scenes of glory
I sing the new, new song,
'twill be the old, old story
that I have loved so long.
[Christ's Birth]

An angel brought glad tidings:
""Send all your fears away,
for Christ, your Lord and Savior,
is born for you this day.""
Then many other angels
sang praise for Jesus' birth:
""To God on high be glory,
and peace to all the earth."" [Refrain]

[Christ's Death]
Christ Jesus, pure and holy,
without a spot or stain,
by wicked hands was taken,
was crucified and slain!
And now the word is finished,
the sinner's debt is paid,
because on Christ the Righteous
the sin of all was laid. [Refrain]
[Christ's Resurrection]

O wonderful redemption!
The price for sin is paid,
salvation is accomplished,
my heart is unafraid,
for God has raised Christ Jesus
to show the work was done;
his glorious resurrection
declared the vict'ry won! [Refrain]
[Christ's Commission]

The Savior of all people
has brought his peace to you;
now go and tell the story,
for others need it too.
To ev'ry land and nation
ring out the gospel call;
proclaim that Christ is risen
and grants his peace to all. [Refrain]
