We’re sailing, sailing over life’s great sea,
And other ships are passing by;
The mighty Saviour shall our Captain be,
His star is shining in the sky.
But while in safety we may glide along,
Led by the Light that never fails,
O hear the cry that rises full and strong
From those who struggle with the gates.

*Ship ahoy! Hear the cry!
“God save them,” we fervently pray!
Ship ahoy! Hear the cry!
O haste to the rescue today!*

Lift up the beacon that shall guide the lost
Unto the haven bright and fair;
O help the wand’ring and the tempest-tossed,
That peace and shelter they may share.
O bring the shipwrecked to the Lifeboat true,
Our Refuge in the wildest storm;
Sing out with gladness and with hope anew,
Our Captain will his word perform. [Refrain]

We’re sailing, sailing over life’s great sea,
And not alone our way we take;
For others, sailing, look to you and me!
O help them for the Master’s sake!
The polar star of mercy shines above,
Our anchor holds forever more;
And dear ones wait, with joyful songs of love,
To greet us on the golden shore. [Refrain]
