There is never a day so dreary,
there is never a night so long,
but the soul that is trusting Jesus
will somewhere find a song.

*Wonderful, wonderful Jesus,
in the heart He implanteth a song:
a song of deliverance, of courage, of strength;
in the heart He implanteth a song.*

There is never a cross so heavy,
there is never a weight of woe,
but that Jesus will help to carry
because He loveth so. [Refrain]

There is never a care or burden,
there is never a grief or loss,
but that Jesus in love will lighten
when carried to the cross. [Refrain]

There is never a guilty sinner,
there is never a wandering one,
but that God can in mercy pardon
through Jesus Christ, His Son. [Refrain]
