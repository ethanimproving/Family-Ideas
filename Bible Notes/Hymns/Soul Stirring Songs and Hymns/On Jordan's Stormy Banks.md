On Jordan's stormy banks I stand,
and cast a wishful eye
to Canaan's fair and happy land,
where my possessions lie.

*I am bound for the promised land,
I am bound for the promised land;
oh, who will come and go with me?
I am bound for the promised land.*

O'er all those wide extended plains
shines one eternal day;
there God the Son forever reigns,
and scatters night away. [Refrain]

No chilling winds or poisonous breath
can reach that healthful shore;
sickness and sorrow, pain and death,
are felt and feared no more. [Refrain]

When I shall reach that happy place,
I'll be forever blest,
for I shall see my Father's face,
and in his bosom rest. [Refrain]
United Methodist Hymnal, 1989
