There is a song in my heart today,
Something I never had;
Jesus has taken my sins away,
O say, but I'm glad!
*O say, but I'm glad, I'm glad,
O say, but I'm glad!
Jesus has come and my cup's overrun,*

Wonderful, marvelous love He brings,
Into a heart that's sad;
Thru darkest tunnels the soul just sings,
O say, but I'm glad! [Refrain]
Won't you come to Him with all your care,
Weary and worn and sad?
You, too, will sing as His love you share,
O say, but I'm glad! [Refrain]
