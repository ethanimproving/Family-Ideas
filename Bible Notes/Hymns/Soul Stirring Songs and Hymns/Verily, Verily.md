Oh, what a Saviour that He died for me!
From condemnation He hath made me free;
""He that believeth on the Son,"" said He,
""Hath everlasting life.""
*""Verily, verily, I say unto you;
Verily, verily,"" message ever new!
""He that believeth on the Son,"" 'tis true!*

All my iniquities on Him were laid,
All my indebtedness by Him was paid;
All who believe on Him, the Lord hath said,
""Hath everlasting life."" [Refrain]
Though poor and needy, I can trust my Lord;
Though weak and sinful, I believe His Word;
O glad message! Ev'ry child of God
""Hath everlasting life."" [Refrain]
Though all unworthy, yet I will not doubt;
For him that cometh He will not cast out;
""He that believeth,"" oh, the good news shout!
""Hath everlasting life."" [Refrain]
