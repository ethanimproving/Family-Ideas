Christ has for sin atonement made,
What a wonderful Saviour!
We are redeemed! the price is paid!
What a wonderful Saviour!

*What a wonderful Saviour is Jesus, my Jesus!
What a wonderful Saviour is Jesus, my Lord!*

I praise Him for the cleansing blood,
What a wonderful Saviour!
That reconciled my soul to God;
What a wonderful Saviour! (Refrain)

He cleansed my heart from all its sin,
What a wonderful Saviour!
And now He reigns and rules therein;
What a wonderful Saviour! (Refrain)

He gives me overcoming pow'r,
What a wonderful Saviour!
And triumph in each trying hour;
What a wonderful Saviour! (Refrain)

To Him I've given all my heart,
What a wonderful Saviour!
The world shall never share a part;
What a wonderful Saviour! (Refrain)
