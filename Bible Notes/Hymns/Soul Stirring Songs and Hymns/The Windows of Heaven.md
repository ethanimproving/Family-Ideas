Lord, send Thy Spirit down,
Like a refreshing show’r;
And let its influence be felt
With pentecostal pow’r.

*Open the windows of heaven, O Lord,
Send a refreshing show’r;
Quicken each drooping, famishing soul,
Show forth Thy wonderful pow’r.*

Within Thy vineyard here,
The Spirit dearth is great;
Lord, for a fresh baptismal show’r
We humbly pray and wait. [Chorus]

Revive Thy work once more,
As in the days of old,
When “near three thousand precious souls”
Were added to the fold. [Chorus]

We have together met,
In Thy most holy name;
Thy promise, “To be with and bless,”
We rightfully can claim. [Chorus]
