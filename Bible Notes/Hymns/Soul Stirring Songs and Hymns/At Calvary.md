Years I spent in vanity and pride,
Caring not my Lord was crucified,
Knowing not it was for me He died on Calvary.

*Mercy there was great and grace was free,
Pardon there was multiplied to me,
There my burdened soul found liberty–
At Calvary.*

By God's Word at last my sin I learned–
Then I trembled at the Law I'd spurned,
Till my guilty soul imploring turned to Calvary. [Refrain]

Now I've giv'n to Jesus ev'rything,
Now I gladly own Him as my King,
Now my raptured soul can only sing of Calvary. [Refrain]

O the love that drew salvation's plan!
O the grace that brought it down to man!
O the mighty gulf that God did span at Calvary. [Refrain]
