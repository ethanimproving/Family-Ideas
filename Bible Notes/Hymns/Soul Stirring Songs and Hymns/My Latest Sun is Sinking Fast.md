My latest sun is sinking fast,
my race is nearly run;
my strongest trials now are past,
my triumph is begun.

*O come, angel band,
come and around me stand;
O bear me away on your snowy wings
to my immortal home.
O bear me away on your snowy wings
to my immortal home.*

I know I’m near the holy ranks
of friends and kindred dear;
I hear the waves on Jordan’s banks,
the crossing must be near. [Refrain]

I’ve almost reached my heav’nly home,
my spirit loudly sings;
your holy ones, behold, they come!
I hear the noise of wings. [Refrain]

O bear my longing heart to him
who bled and died for me;
whose love now covers all my sin,
and gives me victory. [Refrain]
