Jesus Christ is made to me,
All I need, all I need,
He alone, is all my plea,
He is all I need.

*Wisdom, righteousness and powâ€™r,
Holiness forevermore,
My redemption full and sure,
He is all I need.*

Jesus is my all in all,
All I need, all I need,
While He keeps I cannot fall,
He is all I need. [Refrain]

He redeemed me when He died,
All I need, all I need,
I with Him was crucified,
He is all I need. [Refrain]

To My Saviour will I cleave,
All I need, all I need,
He will not His servant leave,
He is all I need. [Refrain]

He's the treasure of my soul,
All I need, all I need,
He hath cleansed and made me whole,
He is all I need. [Refrain]

Glory, glory to the Lamb,
All I need, all I need,
By His Spirit sealed I am,
He is all I need. [Refrain]
