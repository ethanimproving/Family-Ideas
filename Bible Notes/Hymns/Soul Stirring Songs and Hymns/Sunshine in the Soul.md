There is sunshine in my soul today,
More glorious and bright
Than glows in any earthly sky,
For Jesus is my light.

*O thereâ€™s sunshine, blessed sunshine,
When the peaceful happy moments roll:
When Jesus shows His smiling face,
There is sunshine in the soul.*

There is music in my soul today,
A carol to my King,
And Jesus, listening, can hear
The songs I cannot sing. [Refrain]

There is springtime in my soul today,
For when the Lord is near,
The dove of peace sings in my heart,
The flowers of grace appear. [Refrain]

There is gladness in my soul today,
And hope and praise and love
For blessings which He gives me now,
For joys ""laid up"" above. [Refrain]
