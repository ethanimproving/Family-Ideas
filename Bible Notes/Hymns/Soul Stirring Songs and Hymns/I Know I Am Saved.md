I was once a sinner, but I came
Pardon to receive from my Lord.
This was freely given, and I found
That He always kept His word.

*There's a new name Written down in glory,
And it's mine, (And it's mine,)
oh yes, it's mine! (yes, it's mine!)
And the white-robed Angels sing the story,
""A sinner has come home."" (home, has come home.""
For there's a new name written down in glory,
And it's mine, (And it's mine,)
oh yes, it's mine! (yes, it's mine!)
With my sins forgiven I am bound for heaven,
Nevermore to roam.*

I was humbly kneeling at the cross,
Fearing naught but God's angry frown,
When the heavens opened and I saw
That my name was written down. [Chorus]

In the Book 'tis written, ""Saved by grace.""
Oh, the joy that came to my soul!
Now I am forgiven, and I know
By the blood I am made whole. [Chorus]
