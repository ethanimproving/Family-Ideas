O land of rest, for thee I sigh!
When will the moment come
When I shall lay my armor by
And dwell in peace at home?

*We'll work till Jesus comes,
We'll work till Jesus comes,
We'll work till Jesus comes,
And we'll be gathered home.*

To Jesus Christ I fled for rest;
He bade me cease to roam,
And lean for comfort on His breast
Till He conducts me home. [Chorus]
