Just lean upon the arms of Jesus,
He’ll help you along, help you along;
If you will trust His love unfailing,
He’ll fill your heart with song.

*Lean on His arms, trusting in His love;
Lean on His arms, all His mercies prove;
Lean on His arms, looking home above,
Just lean on the Savior’s arms!*

Just lean upon the arms of Jesus,
He’ll brighten the way, brighten the way;
Just follow gladly where He leadeth,
His gentle voice obey. [Refrain]

Just lean upon the arms of Jesus,
Oh, bring every care, bring every care!
The burden that has seemed so heavy,
Take to the Lord in prayer. [Refrain]

Just lean upon the arms of Jesus,
Then leave all to Him, leave all to Him;
His heart is full of love and mercy,
His eyes are never dim. [Refrain]
