Earthly friends may prove untrue,
Doubts and fears assail;
One still loves and cares for you:
Jesus never fails.

*Jesus never fails,
Jesus never fails;
Heav'n and earth may pass away,
But Jesus never fails.*

Though the sky be dark and drear,
Fierce and strong the gale,
Just remember He is near,
And He will not fail. (Refrain)

In life's dark and bitter hour
Love will still prevail;
Trust His everlasting pow'r,
Jesus will not fail. (Refrain)
