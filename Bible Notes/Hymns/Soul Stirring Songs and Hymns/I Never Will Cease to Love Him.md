For all the Lord has done for me,
I never will cease to praise Him;
And for His grace so rich and free,
I never will cease to praise Him.

*I never will cease to praise Him,
my Saviour, my Saviour;
I never will cease to praise Him,
Heâ€™s done so much for me.*

He gives me strength for ev'ry day,
I never will cease to praise Him;
He leads and guides me all the way,
I never will cease to praise Him. [Chorus]

Although the world His love neglect,
I never will cease to praise Him;
I could not such a friend reject,
I never will cease to praise Him. [Chorus]

He saves me ev'ry day and hour,
I never will cease to praise Him;
Just now I feel His cleansing pow'r,
I never will cease to praise Him. [Chorus]

While on my journey here below,
I never will cease to praise Him;
And when to that bright world I go,
I never will cease to praise Him. [Chorus]
