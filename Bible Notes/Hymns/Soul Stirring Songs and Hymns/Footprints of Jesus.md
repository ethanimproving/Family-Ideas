Sweetly, Lord, have we heard Thee calling,
""Come, follow Me!""
And we see where Thy footprints falling,
lead us to Thee.

*Footprints of Jesus that make the pathway glow;
we will follow the steps of Jesus where’er they go.*

Though they lead o’er the cold dark mountains,
seeking His sheep,
or along by Siloam’s fountains,
helping the weak. [Refrain]

If they lead through the temple holy,
preaching the Word,
or in homes of the poor and lowly,
serving the Lord. [Refrain]

Then at last, when on high He sees us,
our journey done,
we will rest where the steps of Jesus
end at His throne. [Refrain]
