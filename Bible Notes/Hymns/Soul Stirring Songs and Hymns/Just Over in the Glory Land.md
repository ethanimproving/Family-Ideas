I’ve a home prepared where the saints abide,
Just over in the gloryland;
And I long to be by my Savior’s side,
Just over in the gloryland.

*Just over in the gloryland,
I’ll join the happy angel band,
Just over in the gloryland;
Just over in the gloryland,
There with the mighty host I’ll stand,
Just over in the gloryland.*

I am on my way to those mansions fair,
Just over in the gloryland;
There to sing God’s praise, and His glory share,
Just over in the gloryland. [Refrain]

What a joyful thought that my Lord I’ll see,
Just over in the gloryland;
And with kindred saved, there forever be,
Just over in the gloryland. [Refrain]

With the bloodwashed throng I will shout and sing,
Just over in the gloryland;
Glad hosannas to Christ, the Lord and King,
Just over in the gloryland. [Refrain]
