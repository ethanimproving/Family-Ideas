I know I love Thee better, Lord
Than any earthly joy:
For Thou hast given me the peace
Which nothing can destroy.

*The half has never yet been told,
Of love so full and free;
The half has never yet been told,
The blood, it cleanseth me.*

I know that Thou art nearer still
Than any earthly throng;
And sweeter is the thought of Thee
Than any lovely song. [Refrain]

Thou hast put gladness in my heart,
Then may I well be glad;
Without the secret of Thy love,
I could not but be sad. [Refrain]

O Savior, precious Savior mine!
What will Thy presence be,
If such a life of joy can crown
Our walk on earth with Thee? [Refrain]
