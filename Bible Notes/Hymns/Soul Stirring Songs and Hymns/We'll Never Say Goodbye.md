Our friends on earth we meet with pleasure,
While swift the moments fly,
Yet ever comes the tho’t of sadness,
That we must say goodbye.

*We’ll never say goodbye in heav’n,
We’ll never say goodbye,
For in that land of joy and song
We’ll never say goodbye.*

How joyful is the tho’t that lingers,
When loved ones cross death’s sea,
That when our labors here are ended,
With them we’ll ever be. [Refrain]

No parting words shall e’er be spoken
In that bright land of flow’rs,
But songs of joy, and peace, and gladness
Shall evermore be ours. [Refrain]
