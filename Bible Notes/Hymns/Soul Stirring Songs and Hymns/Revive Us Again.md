We praise thee, O God, for the Son of thy love,
for Jesus who died, and is now gone above.

*Hallelujah! Thine the glory, hallelujah! Amen!
Hallelujah! Thine the glory, revive us again.*

We praise thee, O God, for thy Spirit of light
who has shown us our Savior and scattered our night. [Refrain]

We praise thee, O God, for the joy thou hast giv’n
to thy saints in communion, these foretastes of heav’n. [Refrain]

Revive us again, fill each heart with thy love.
May each soul be rekindled with fire from above. [Refrain]
