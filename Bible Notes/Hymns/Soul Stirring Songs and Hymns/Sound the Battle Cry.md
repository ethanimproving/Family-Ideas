Sound the battle cry!
See, the foe is nigh;
Raise the standard high
For the Lord;
Gird your armor on,
Stand firm, every one;
Rest your cause upon
His holy Word.

*Rouse, then, soldiers, rally round the banner,
Ready, steady, pass the word along;
Onward, forward, shout aloud, Hosanna!
Christ is Captain of the mighty throng.*

Strong to meet the foe,
Marching on we go,
While our cause we know,
Must prevail;
Shield and banner bright,
Gleaming in the light;
Battling for the right
We ne’er can fail. (Refrain)

O Thou God of all,
Hear us when we call,
Help us one and all
By Thy grace;
When the battle’s done,
And the victory’s won,
May we wear the crown
Before Thy face. (Refrain)
