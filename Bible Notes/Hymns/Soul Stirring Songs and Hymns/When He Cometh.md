When He cometh, when He cometh
To make up His jewels,
All His jewels, precious jewels,
His loved and His own:

*Like the stars of the morning,
His bright crown adorning,
They shall shine in their beauty,
Bright gems for His crown.*

He will gather, He will gather
The gems for His kingdom;
All the pure ones, all the bright ones,
His loved and His own. [Refrain]

Little children, little children,
Who love their Redeemer,
Are the jewels, precious jewels,
His loved and His own. [Refrain]
