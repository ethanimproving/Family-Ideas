Come, we that love the Lord,
and let our joys be known.
Join in a song with sweet accord,
join in a song with sweet accord,
and thus surround the throne,
and thus surround the throne.

*We’re marching to Zion,
beautiful, beautiful Zion.
We’re marching upward to Zion,
the beautiful city of God.*

The hill of Zion yields
a thousand sacred sweets,
before we reach the heav’nly fields,
before we reach the heav’nly fields,
or walk the golden streets,
or walk the golden streets. [Refrain]

Then let our songs abound,
and ev’ry tear be dry.
We’re marching thro’ Immanuel’s ground,
we’re marching thro’ Immanuel’s ground,
to fairer worlds on high,
to fairer worlds on high. [Refrain]
