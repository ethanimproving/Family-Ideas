There is a name I love to hear,
I love to sing its worth;
it sounds like music in my ear,
the sweetest name on earth.

*O how I love Jesus,
O how I love Jesus,
O how I love Jesus,
because he first loved me!*

It tells me of a Savior's love,
who died to set me free;
it tells me of his precious blood,
the sinner's perfect plea. [Refrain]

It tells of one whose loving heart
can feel my deepest woe;
who in each sorrow bears a part
that none can bear below. [Refrain]
United Methodist Hymnal, 1989
