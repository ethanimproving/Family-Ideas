The cross it standeth fast -
Hallelujah, hallelujah!
Defying ev'ry blast -
Hallelujah, hallelujah!
The winds of hell have blown,
The world its hate hath shown,
Yet it is not overthrown -
Hallelujah for the cross!

*Hallelujah, hallelujah,
hallelujah for the cross;
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
it shall never suffer loss!*

It is the old cross still -
Hallelujah, hallelujah!
Its triumph let us tell -
Hallelujah, hallelujah!
The grace of God here shone
Thru Christ, the blessed Son,
Who did for sin atone -
Hallelujah for the cross! [Refrain]

'Twas here the debt was paid -
Hallelujah, hallelujah!
Our sins on Jesus laid -
Hallelujah, hallelujah!
So round the cross we sing
Of Christ, our offering,
Of Christ, our living King -
Hallelujah for the cross! [Refrain]
