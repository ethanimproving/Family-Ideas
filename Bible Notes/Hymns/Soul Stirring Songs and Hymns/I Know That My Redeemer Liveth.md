I know that my Redeemer liveth,
And on the earth again shall stand;
I know eternal life He giveth,
That grace and power are in His hand.

*I know, I know that Jesus liveth,
And on the earth again shall stand;
I know, I know that life He giveth,
That grace and power are in His hand.*

I know His promise never faileth,
The word He speaks, it cannot die;
Tho' cruel death my flesh assaileth,
Yet I shall see Him by and by.
[Chorus]

I know my mansion He prepareth,
That where He is there I may be;
Oh, wondrous thought, for me He careth,
And He at last will come for me.
[Chorus]
