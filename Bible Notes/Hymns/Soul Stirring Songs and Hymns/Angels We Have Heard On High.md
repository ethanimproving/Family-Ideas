Angels we have heard on high,
sweetly singing o'er the plains,
and the mountains in reply
echoing their joyous strains.

*Gloria in excelsis Deo,
gloria in excelsis Deo.*

Shepherds, why this jubilee?
Why your joyous strains prolong?
What the gladsome tidings be
which inspire your heav'nly song? [Refrain]

Come to Bethlehem and see
him whose birth the angels sing;
come, adore on bended knee
Christ the Lord, the newborn King. [Refrain]
