Jesus loves me, this I know,
for the Bible tells me so.
Little ones to him belong;
they are weak, but he is strong.

*Yes, Jesus loves me! Yes, Jesus loves me!
Yes, Jesus loves me! The Bible tells me so.*

Jesus loves me he who died
heaven's gate to open wide.
He will wash away my sin,
let his little child come in. [Refrain]

Jesus loves me, this I know,
as he loved so long ago,
taking children on his knee,
saying, ""Let them come to me."" [Refrain]
Psalter Hymnal, 1987
