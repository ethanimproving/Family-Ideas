Lift up the trumpet, and loud let it ring:
Jesus is coming again!
Cheer up, ye pilgrims, be joyful and sing;
Jesus is coming again!
Refrain
Coming again, coming again,
Jesus is coming again!

Echo it, hilltops; proclaim it, ye plains:
Jesus is coming again!
Coming in glory, the Lamb that was slain;
Jesus is coming again! [Refrain]

Heavings of earth, tell the vast, wond'ring throng:
Jesus is coming again!
Tempests and whirlwinds, the anthem prolong;
Jesus is coming again! [Refrain]

Nations are angryâ€” by this we do know
Jesus is coming again!
Knowledge increases; men run to and fro;
Jesus is coming again! [Refrain]
