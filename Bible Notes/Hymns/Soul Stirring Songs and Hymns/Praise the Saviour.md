Praise the Savior, all ye nations,
Praise him, all ye hosts above;
Shout with joyful acclamations,
His divine, victorious love:
Be his kingdom now promoted,
Let the earth her monarch know;
Be my all to him devoted,
To my Lord my all I owe.

See how beauteous on the mountains
Are their feet, whose grand design
Is to guide us to the fountains,
That o’erflow with bliss divine,—
Who proclaim the joyful tidings
Of salvation all around,—
Disregard the world’s deridings,
And in works of love abound.

With my substance will I honor
My Redeemer and my Lord;
Were ten thousand worlds my manor
All were nothing to his word:
While the heralds of salvation
His abounding grace proclaim,
Let his friends of every station,
Gladly join to spread his fame.
