My Father is rich in houses and land,
He holdeth the wealth of the world in His hands!
Of rubies and diamonds, of silver and gold,
His coffers are full, He has riches untold.

*I’m a child of the King,
A child of the King,
With Jesus my Savior,
I’m a child of the King.*

My Father’s own Son, the Savior of men,
Once wandered on earth as the poorest of them;
But now He is reigning for ever on high,
And will give me a home in heav'n by and by. [Refrain]

I once was an outcast stranger on earth,
A sinner by choice and an alien by birth;
But I’ve been adopted, my name’s written down,
An heir to a mansion, a robe and a crown. [Refrain]

A tent or a cottage, why should I care?
They’re building a palace for me over there;
Though exiled from home, yet still may I sing:
All glory to God, I’m a child of the King. [Refrain]
