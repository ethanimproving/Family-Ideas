The trusting heart to Jesus clings,
Nor any ill forbodes,
But at the cross of Calv'ry sings,
Praise God for lifted loads!
*Singing, I go along life's road,
Praising the Lord, praising the Lord;
Singing, I go along life's road,*

The passing days bring many cares,
""Fear not,"" I hear Him say,
And when my fears are turned to pray'rs,
The burdens slip away. [Refrain]
He tells me of my Father's love
And never slumb'ring eye;
My everlasting King above
Will all my needs supply. [Refrain]
When to the throne of grace I flee,
I find the promise true,
The mighty arms upholding me
Will bear my burdens too. [Refrain]
