I hear the Savior say,
""Thy strength indeed is small,
Child of weakness, watch and pray,
Find in Me thine all in all.""

*Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe;
Sin had left a crimson stain,
He washed it white as snow.*

Lord, now indeed I find
Thy pow'r and Thine alone,
Can change the leper's spots
And melt the heart of stone. [Refrain]

For nothing good have I
Where-by Thy grace to claim;
I'll wash my garments white
In the blood of Calv'ry's Lamb. [Refrain]

And when, before the throne,
I stand in Him complete,
""Jesus died my soul to save,""
My lips shall still repeat. [Refrain]
Baptist Hymnal, 1991
