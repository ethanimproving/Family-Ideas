Gone from my heart the world with all its charm;
Now thro' the blood I'm saved from all alarms;
Down at the cross my heart is bending low;
The precious blood of Jesus cleanses white as snow.

*I love Him, I love Him,
Because He first loved me,
And purchased my salvation on Calv’ry’s tree.*

Once I was lost, and 'way down deep in sin;
Once was a slave to passions within;
Once was afraid to meet an angry God,
But now I'm cleansed from ev'ry stain thro' Jesus’ blood. [Chorus]

Once I was bound, but now I am set free;
Once I was blind, but now the light I see;
Once I was dead, but now in Christ I live,
To tell the world around the peace that He doth give. [Chorus]
