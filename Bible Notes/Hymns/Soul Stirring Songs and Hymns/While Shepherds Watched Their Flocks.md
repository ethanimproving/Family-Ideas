While shepherds watched their flocks by night,
all seated on the ground,
an angel of the Lord came down,
and glory shone around.

""Fear not,"" said he for mighty dread
had seized their troubled mind
""glad tidings of great joy I bring
to you and all mankind.

""To you, in David's town, this day
is born of David's line
a Savior, who is Christ the Lord;
and this shall be the sign:

""The heavenly babe you there shall find
to human view displayed,
all simply wrapped in swaddling clothes
and in a manger laid.""

Thus spoke the angel. Suddenly
appeared a shining throng
of angels praising God, who thus
addressed their joyful song:

""All glory be to God on high,
and to the earth be peace;
to those on whom his favor rests
goodwill shall never cease.""
Psalter Hymnal, 1987
