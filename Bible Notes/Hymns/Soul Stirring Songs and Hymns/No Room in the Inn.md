No beautiful chamber,
No soft cradle bed,
No place but a manger,
Nowhere for His head;
No praises of gladness,
No tho't of their sin,
No glory but sadness,
No room in the inn.

*No room, no room, for Jesus,
Oh, give Him welcome free,
Lest you should hear at Heavenâ€™s gate,
""There is no room for thee.""*

No sweet consecration,
No seeking His part,
No humiliation,
No place in the heart;
No tho't of the Savior,
No sorrow for sin,
No prayer for His favor,
No room in the inn. [Chorus]

No one to receive Him,
No welcome while here,
No balm to relieve Him,
No staff but a spear;
No seeking His treasure,
No weeping for sin,
No doing His pleasure,
No room in the inn. [Chorus]
