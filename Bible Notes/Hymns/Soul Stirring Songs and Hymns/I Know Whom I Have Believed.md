I know not why God’s wondrous grace
to me is daily shown,
nor why, with mercy, Christ in love
redeemed me for his own.

*But “I know whom I have believed,
and am persuaded that he is able
to keep that which I’ve committed
unto him against that day.”*

I know not how this saving faith
to me he did impart,
nor how believing in his word
wrought peace within my heart. [Refrain]

I know not how the Spirit moves,
convincing us of sin,
revealing Jesus through the Word,
creating faith in him. [Refrain]

I know not when my Lord may come,
at night or noon-day fair,
nor if I’ll walk the vale with him,
or meet him in the air. [Refrain]
