Love divine, so great and wondrous,
Deep and mighty, pure, sublime,
Coming from the heart of Jesus,
Just the same through tests of time!

*He the pearly gates will open,
So that I may enter in;
For He purchased my redemption
And forgave me all my sin.*

Like a dove when hunted, frightened,
As a wounded fawn was I;
Brokenhearted, yet He healed me.
He will heed the sinner's cry. [Chorus]

Love divine, so great and wondrous!
All my sins He then forgave;
I will sing His praise forever,
For His blood, His power to save. [Chorus]

In life's eventide, at twilight,
At His door I'll knock and wait;
By the precious love of Jesus,
I shall enter heaven's gate. [Chorus]
