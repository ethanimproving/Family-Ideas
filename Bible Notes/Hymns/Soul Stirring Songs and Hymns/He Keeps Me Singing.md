There's within my heart a melody;
Jesus whispers sweet and low,
""Fear not, I am with you, peace, be still,""
in all of life's ebb and flow.

*Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
sweetest name I know,
fills my every longing,
keeps me singing as I go.*

All my life was wrecked by sin and strife,
discord filled my heart with pain,
Jesus swept across the broken strings,
stirred the slumbering chords again. [Refrain]

Though sometimes He leads through waters deep,
trials fall across the way;
though sometimes the path seems rough and steep,
see His footprints all the way. [Refrain]

Feasting on the riches of His grace,
resting 'neath His sheltering wing,
always looking on His smiling face,
that is why I shout and sing. [Refrain]

Soon He's coming back to welcome me
far beyond the starry sky;
I shall wing my flight to worlds unknown,
I shall reign with Him on high. [Refrain]
