# 1. She’s selfless

For Jesus to ask what she wants, and she asks for her children shows how selfless mothers are.

Christ’s mindset was to put us above his own self. While he deserved the glory, he took our punishment and died for us, and elicited is above himself. The Bible says this is our example to elevate everyone else above ourselves. 
> [!Bible] [Philippians 2:3-5 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Philippians+2:3-5?translation=kjv)
> 3. Let nothing
be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.
> 4. Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.
> 5. Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:


Imagine if God grants you one request in your entire life, and you use it for someone else. Caring above your sons to be elevated instead of yourselves being elevated.

The only people who care about you when you’re old are your children and grandchildren. The women that kills their kids to focus on themselves and win an academy award are forgotten in 5 years. But the person who will be remembered for all of eternity is the mother of Zebedee's children.

Mothers sacrifice their body. Being pregnant for 9 months is a hard ask. Being healthy and being fit is not better than being a mother. Women have a lot to give to the world with their energy. They can use it working on themselves, traveling, shopping, complaining online, but to give it all to their children is selfless. God gave you so much youth and energy and strength not to find a purse to match with every outfit, but to put it towards having children. The WMBA loses money every year and the NBA supplements their losses. What’s more important than elevating women’s sports is elevating womanhood. One thing that woman can do that men can never do is have children.

She sacrifices her time. Throughout history if you didn’t get up early and make food, you didn’t eat. We have such an abundance of food today that we can skip breakfast and it’s no problem, because we will have food later. They didn’t always have lunch back then. Today many don’t even know how to cook. In the past they wouldn’t have survived if that was the case. 
> [!Bible] [Proverbs 31:15 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Proverbs+31:15?translation=kjv)
> 15. She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.


Women in the Bible are very smart. She openeth her mouth with wisdom.

Mothers are patient. When you’ve had a bad day you want mom, not dad.

Instead of wasting multitasking in a management system in a corporate office, bless the women who use that in the home. Cooking, cleaning, tending to multiple children that need attention, all while they’re tired. They juggle everything. If anyone is going to thank them it’s the children, so thank your moms. 
Proverbs 31:

# 2.  She’s spiritual

She is also spiritual praise God for women who are choosing to be spiritual.
> [!Bible] [Matthew 20:20 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Matthew+20:20?translation=kjv)
> 20. Then came to him the mother of Zebedee’s children with her sons, worshipping
him, and desiring a certain thing of him.


***Every day God is asking, “What wilt thou?” Every day you can pray. Prayer is an exercise of faith. We see a 40 year Faith going from grandmother to mother into Timothy. Why is Timothy such a great guy? Because of his mother and grandmother and their great faith.
> [!Bible] [2 Timothy 1:5 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/2Timothy+1:5?translation=kjv)
> 5. When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.


***You talk too much, maybe you’ll be a preacher because you have important things to say. You’re so stubborn, maybe you’re going to be a Stedfast Christian in the future.
> [!Bible] [Esther 7:2 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Esther+7:2?translation=kjv)
> 2. And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What
is thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted thee: and what
is thy request? and it shall be performed,
even to the half of the kingdom.


Mariana is meek and quiet. Maybe God intends to make her a strong stay at home mom.

Mariana is athletic. Maybe God intends to teach our children to be active.

You’re such a great warrior, you’re going to be a warrior for Jesus. Strategy, war, fighting. We can turn that into a spiritual weapon to be used. Get a big vision for your children. You’re going to have to work on them. 

> [!Bible] [Proverbs 29:18 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Proverbs+29:18?translation=kjv)
> 18. Where
there is no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy
is he.


# 3. She’s steadfast

She’s casting vision for her children. They are raised to be steadfast.
> [!Bible] [Proverbs 22:6 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Proverbs+22:6?translation=kjv)
> 6. Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.


James the Great and John the Beloved have the same mother. She is a great example of a mother.

He did exactly what his mother cast the vision for.
> [!Bible] [Acts 12:2 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Acts+12:2?translation=kjv)
> 2. And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.


God can greatly use Mariana. How? Find out. Create a vision.
