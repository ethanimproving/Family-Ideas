[Don't Be a Lazy Jerk! - Bro. Dillon Awes](https://rumble.com/v49ukdz-dont-be-a-lazy-jerk-bro.-dillon-awes.html)

A sloth is someone who has a habitual disinclination to exertion. 
> [!bible] [Proverbs 10:26 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Proverbs+10:26?translation=kjv)
> 26. As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so
is the sluggard to them that send him.


When God wants to use someone in the capacity of a pastor, that person has to desire the work.
> [!bible] [1 Timothy 3:1 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/1+Timothy+3:1?translation=kjv)
> 1. This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.


> [!bible] [Hebrews 6:10-12 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Hebrews+6:10-12?translation=kjv)
> 10. For God is not unrighteous to forget your **work** and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have **ministered to the saints**, and do minister.
> 11. And we desire that *every one of you* do shew the same **diligence** to the full assurance of hope unto the end:
> 12. That ye **be not slothful**, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.

# 1. A lazy jerk refuses to work.

Disorderly means not working. If people started shaming the lazy young men asking for money, they wouldn't be on the side of the road. Starve to death! That's what the Bible teaches.
> [!bible] [2 Thessalonians 3:6-12 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/2+Thessalonians+3:6-12?translation=kjv)
> 6. Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.
> 7. For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;
> 8. Neither did we eat any manâ€™s bread for nought; but wrought with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:
> 9. Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us.
> 10. For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.
> 11. For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.
> 12. Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.

The person who's lazy desires things but has nothing. The person who works at least has something, even if it's little. A little apartment.
> [!bible] [Proverbs 13:4 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Proverbs+13:4?translation=kjv)
> 4. The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing: but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat.

# 2. A lazy jerk is habitually messy

This sounds like soul-winning in South Dallas and Duncanville. Even if you're poor, take care of your stuff. Does being poor prevent you form cleaning your house? Does being poor prevent you from having a disastrous side? No. Being lazy causes you to be poor.
> [!bible] [Proverbs 24:30-34 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Proverbs+24:30-34?translation=kjv)
> 30. I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;
> 31. And, lo, it was all ==grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down==.
> 32. Then I saw, and considered it well: I looked upon it, and received instruction.
> 33. Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:
> 34. So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed man.

Don't litter. Put your shopping cart away. Those people have no consideration for someone else. Someone else is going to cleanup your mess. You should be ashamed if you don't put your shopping cart away.

[Cart Narcs - Shaming People Who Don't Put Back Carts!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzWQH0u4VJU)
> [!bible] [Deuteronomy 23:9-13 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Deuteronomy+23:9-13?translation=kjv)
> 9. When the host goeth forth against thine enemies, then keep thee from every wicked thing.
> 10. ==If there be among you any man, that is not clean== by reason of uncleanness that chanceth him by night, then ==shall he go abroad out of the camp==, he shall not come within the camp:
> 11. But it shall be, when evening cometh on, he shall ==wash himself with water==: and when the sun is down, he shall come into the camp again.
> 12. Thou shalt have a place also without the camp, whither thou shalt go forth abroad:
> 13. And thou shalt have a paddle upon thy weapon; and it shall be, when thou wilt ease thyself abroad, thou shalt dig therewith, and shalt turn back and ==cover that which cometh from thee==:
> 14. For the LORD thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to deliver thee, and to give up thine enemies before thee; therefore shall thy camp be holy: ==that he see no unclean thing in thee, and turn away from thee==.

There's something wrong with your heart if you're always messy. They are inconsiderate and lazy. What would stop you from being messy is if you were considerate. If I don't put my shopping cart away that means someone else has to do it. If I throw my McDonalds bag outside my car in the middle of the road, the worker at Stedfast is probably going to pick it up. What's the problem? Laziness. What's the problem? Not caring about others.
> [!bible] [Hebrews 10:24 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Hebrews+10:24?translation=kjv)
> 24. And let us ==consider one another== to provoke unto love and to good works:

# 3. A lazy jerk sleeps too much

There are hundreds of people in Dallas asleep right now because they were up until 3AM doing drugs.
> [!bible] [Proverbs 6:9-11 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Proverbs+6:9-11?translation=kjv)
> 9. ==How long wilt thou sleep==, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?
> 10. Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:
> 11. So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.

Sometimes there are seasons in your life where you will get less sleep. If you sleep during harvest your family is going to lose a lot of food and a lot of money. You worked all year long watering this field, and now it's time for harvest, you've got to go. Otherwise it's going to spoil and all that work was for nothing. Don't let the work of Jesus Christ on the cross be for nothing. Go soul-winning, it is time for the harvest. 
> [!bible] [Proverbs 10:5 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Proverbs+10:5?translation=kjv)
> 5. He that gathereth in summer is a wise son: but ==he that sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame==.

Sleeping sends you into an endless cycle of exhaustion. If you want to feel energized you cannot sleep too much. Our bodies were designed by God to go through struggle. Take a cold shower and see what happens to your energy. Go for a run and see if you feel tired. Do 50 pushups and see if you feel like sleeping. But lie in bed doing nothing, and [[The Miracle Morning#Don't Sit On Your Bed|you will become tired]].
> [!bible] [Proverbs 19:15 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Proverbs+19:15?translation=kjv)
> 15. Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.

Sometimes people get an imbalanced view of this verse, thinking exercise isn't important, but the Bible is actually saying bodily exercise is profitable. But in comparison to godliness it's profitable little. Why? Because bodily exercise only profits you in this life. Godliness profits you in this life and the next. 
> [!bible] [1 Timothy 4:8 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/1+Timothy+4:8?translation=kjv)
> 8. For **bodily exercise profiteth** little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.

Sleep is a means to an end so you can be a high functioning person. It isn't the most pleasurable thing that you should be looking forward to all day.
> [!bible] [Proverbs 20:13 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Proverbs+20:13?translation=kjv)
> 13. Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, and thou shalt be satisfied with bread.

Being very poor is related to how much you sleep. People who are poor sleep way more than people who are wealthy. And who's life is better? Sleep is literally what you do to avoid living. 
> [!bible] [Proverbs 24:33-34 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Proverbs+24:33-34?translation=kjv)
> 33. Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:
> 34. So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed man.

These guys are laboring for the meat that perisheth and living this world, serving themselves, but they are successful, and they don't sleep too much. You don't have to wake up at 4AM every day, but you can't oversleep all the time and be successful.

> [!bible] [Genesis 28:18 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Genesis+28:18?translation=kjv)
> 18. And **Jacob rose up early in the morning**, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.

> [!bible] [Mark 1:35 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Mark+1:35?translation=kjv)

> [!bible] [John 8:1-2 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/John+8:1-2?translation=kjv)

# 4. A lazy jerk is a poor steward

A slothful man goes hunting. Hunting takes a lot of work. It takes a lot of preparation, you have to drive really far, buy a bunch of specialized gear, walk deep into the woods, know where the animals are, it takes a lot of planning and work. But once he kills his animal, he doesn't roast that which he took in hunting. The whole goal of hunting is the meat. The lazy person goes through all of that and doesn't even roast it. **It's like the person who starts projects and doesn't finish them.** 
> [!bible] [Proverbs 12:27 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Proverbs+12:27?translation=kjv)
> 27. The slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting: but the substance of a diligent man is precious.

If you can't put your shopping cart away, I guarantee you won't work hard when no one else is watching you. If you're unfaithful in the least thing, you will be unfaithful in other things. I guarantee there is a correlation between violent crime rate / bastard children and people that don't put away their cart, because he that is unjust in that which is least is unjust in that which is much. 
> [!bible] [Luke 16:10 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Luke+16:10?translation=kjv)
> 10. He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.

I have the opposite problem. I will do things when nobody is watching, but if there are people around I won't work. I won't clean up, or put chairs away, because I'm worried about doing it wrong. Or I'm worried someone will thank me, or notice it, and think I care. For some reason **I don't want people to think of me as if I'm altruistic, because there can be an element of "Look at me, I'm a humble servant," to acts of ministry.** I don't want people to think that I'm falsely humble, so I don't minister when people are watching. But I need to get over that, because love believes all things. I don't have the right to be suspicious about people thinking I'm falsely humble. In fact, it's better to do the right thing for the praise then not to do it at all. Seek the recognition if that's what it takes to clean up the mess at church.

If you see something on the ground, pick it up.

Who buys lottery tickets? Poor people. They waste the small amount that God has blessed them with. They spend money of drugs, alcohol, lottery tickets, and they are unfaithful. A lot of times they are in those positions because of these character issues. 
> [!bible] [Proverbs 18:9 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Proverbs+18:9?translation=kjv)
> 9. He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster.

# 5. A lazy jerk gives up easily

If it's not the easiest path possible, a lazy person gives up. When lazy people are working, all they see are problems. Don't be the person that only presents problems to people. If you're going to point out a problem, you should already have brainstormed 2 or 3 or 5 solutions. 
> [!bible] [Proverbs 15:19 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Proverbs+15:19?translation=kjv)
> 19. The way of the slothful man is as an hedge of thorns: but the way of the righteous is made plain.

Don't let the cold stop you from going soul-winning. 
> [!bible] [Proverbs 20:4 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Proverbs+20:4?translation=kjv)
> 4. The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold;
therefore shall he beg in harvest, and have nothing.

The slothful man is on his way to accomplish a task, but there's an obstacle, so he gives up.
> [!bible] [Proverbs 22:13 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Proverbs+22:13?translation=kjv)
> 13. The slothful man saith, There is a lion without, I shall be slain in the streets.

Benaiah solved that problem on a snowy day. Not only was there a lion, there was snow and a lion, and he got the job done.
> [!bible] [1 Chronicles 11:22 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/1+Chronicles+11:22?translation=kjv)
> 22. Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day.

God wants us to present our whole bodies as a sacrifice to him. All of our life energy in our bodies should be yielded to God. You cannot follow this verse and be a lazy person.
> [!bible] [Romans 12:1 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Romans+12:1?translation=kjv)
> 1. I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.

Let us be good examples that we're going to serve the Lord with all of our might. 
> [!bible] [Romans 12:10-11 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Romans+12:10-11?translation=kjv)
> 10. Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;
> 11. Not slothful in business; ==fervent in spirit; serving the Lord==;
