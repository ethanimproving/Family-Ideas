# The Despair Of Sin

I love this. And so want to believe it. A stumbling block for me is John 14:23.

> [!Bible] [John 14:23 - GNT](https://bible-api.com/John+14:23?translation=kjv)
> 23. Jesus answered him, "Those who love me will obey my teaching. My Father will love them, and my Father and I will come to them and live with them."

How can a man who loves Jesus disobey Him by sinning? I do love Him, really really. But not enough, it seems- because I sin. I pray often for more of Him and less of me, but still I fall. It seems an impossibility to fulfil, so I constantly feel I am letting Him down, and fear He will lose patience with me. Obedience is so hard, and yet if it is a measure of my love for Him, I am a treacherous wretch. I read that He loves me but I fear that He will look at my life and see more litter than grass and that I will get what I deserve. And that is my greatest fear. I yearn to be acceptable to Him, but just can't pull it off. My grief for this could crack boulders. I want to be the good soil in the parable of the sower, but am way short: more a swamp. Woe is me!

# The Hope Of The Gospel

## We Aren't Saved By Loving God

Loving God is a commandment, not what gets you saved. The reason verse 6 of that chapter is true, that no one comes to the Father except through Jesus, is because **we all fall short in loving God** with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength. 

Look at verse 15:
> [!Bible] [John 14:15 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/john+14:15?translation=kjv)
> 15. ==If ye love me==, keep my commandments.

> [!Bible] [John 14:21 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/John+14:21?translation=kjv)
> 21. He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, ==he it is that loveth me==: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.

Three times he emphasizes this in John 14. **If you want a close fellowship with God you’ve got to keep his commandments**. And if you want God to abide with you, and be right there with you, and be manifested to you, if you want to know God, and really see God, he’s saying, “You’ve got to keep his commandments.” He says, “I’m not going to show myself to the world (verse 17, 19, 22). I’m going to reveal myself to those that love me.”

## Sonship

If you’ve been born again, you are regenerated (from the word genes).

> [!Bible] [Titus 3:5 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Titus+3:5?translation=kjv)
> 5. Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, ==by the washing of regeneration==, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;

Sonship isn’t determined by actions and behaviors and affections. It’s dependent upon genetics. Your heavenly father being pleased with you is separate from you being in the family of God, just like with your dad growing up. Some days it’s, “Hey son, I’m proud of you. Good job.” Other days it’s, “What’s wrong with you boy? Straighten up.” But that never changes your relationship. That’s your dad. You’re in the family. 

Don’t confuse things that get you into the family, which is birth, with things that fulfil your role in the family. If we had to please God to stay sons of God, it would be meaningless the passage that reads,

> [!Bible] [Hebrews 12:6 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/hebrews+12:6?translation=kjv)
> 6. For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.

because God would just kick us out of the family. But God doesn’t do that. He disciplines us, and more and more as we grow in maturity and the knowledge of his will (Luke 12:48). We love him because he first loved us, and once we’re a child of God, nothing can separate us from the love of God (Romans 8:38-39). 

But Jesus is not taking for granted that we love him. God so loved us that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth shall have everlasting life, but do we necessarily love him? Well the measure of our love is going to be our obedience to his commandments.

## The Law Is A Mirror

While it's true that our sin shows our shortcomings in loving God, this is unrelated to our salvation. The whole point of the law hangs on the command to love God and love our neighbor, and there is no person who does not come short of that. And since sin is the transgression of the law (1 John 3:4), one of the ways you can define sin is when you do not love God with all your heart, soul, and mind. Thank God that he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him (2 Corinthians 5:21), having commended his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us (Romans 5:8).

If you think your salvation depends on how much fruit you produce for God, or how much you love God, you’ve missed it. You’re not saved. 

> "I yearn to be acceptable to Him, but just can't pull it off."

You are so close to salvation. I want to help you finally get off this rollercoaster of despair. For a lost person to be saved they MUST believe:

## The Gospel Outline

1) That they are a **sinner** (Romans 3:10-12, 23, Ecclesiastes 7:20)
2) That the punishment for their sin is **hell** (Romans 6:23, Revelation 20:14-15, 21:8)
3) That salvation was **paid for in full by Jesus Christ** (Romans 5:8, Isaiah 53:6, 1 Peter 2:24, 2 Corinthians 5:21)
4) That eternal life is a **free gift** (Romans 5:15, 6:23, Ephesians 2:8-9, Acts 11:17, Revelation 21:6, 22:17, Titus 1:2)
5) In the **eternal security** of the believer (1 John 5:10-11, Romans 8:30, Ephesians 1:13-14, John 10:28)

## 3. Sin

Let’s take these one at a time. A person that doesn’t believe he’s a sinner cannot be saved because if I’m not a sinner, there’s nothing to forgive. If there’s nothing to forgive, Jesus didn’t do anything for me. If he didn’t do anything for me, I’m not believing on him for salvation. If I’m not believing on him for salvation, I’m not saved.

## 2. Hell

You must believe that the just punishment for your sin is hell because if you don’t deserve hell, you have nothing to be saved from, and therefore will not seek the Savior, believing on him for the remission of sins.

## 3. Jesus Paid It All

You must believe that salvation was paid for in full by Jesus, because if you don’t, you must add something to the finished work of Jesus Christ, and your faith will be distributed between the blood of Jesus and XYZ. And the “Jesus plus” gospel, where Jesus gets you 98% the way there, and then you’re responsible for that last 2% based on your efforts to live more righteously, is nothing short of a works salvation, and it’s powerless to save anyone. Listen to what Paul says in Galatians 5: 

> [!Bible] [Galatians 5:1-4 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/galatians+5:1-4?translation=kjv)
> 1. Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.
> 2. Behold, I Paul say unto you, that **if ye be circumcised**, ==Christ shall profit you nothing==.
> 3. For I testify again to **every man that is circumcised**, that ==he is a debtor to do the whole law==.
> 4. ==Christ is become of no effect unto you==, whosoever of you are **justified by the law**; ye are fallen from grace.

If your faith is distributed between the blood of Jesus and some work that you have to do, let me join Paul in saying the cross is of no effect to you (Galatians 5:4). There are a lot of false teachers in the world today preaching, “Follow Jesus and thou shalt be saved,” where your salvation depends not on the cross of Christ, but on your own cross. That message is straight from hell, and it’s causing people to reject the clear teaching of the Bible that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life (John 3:15), and to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness (Romans 4:5). We’re reconciled by the blood of his cross (Colossians 1:20). If righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain (Galatians 2:21). Jesus paid it all, and strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, because no man cometh unto the Father, but by Jesus. He is the door (John 10:9), and if you’re going to be reconciled, it’s going to be because of what he did, not because of what you do. Believe that Jesus paid it all, and there’s nothing you can add to it.

## 4. Free Gift

You must believe that eternal life is a free gift because **if you try and pay for salvation, or earn forgiveness, your salvation depends on you to do what Jesus left undone**. If the qualifying element of forgiveness was, “Show God you’re earnest by giving up certain sins,” it’s no longer by grace through faith. 

> [!Bible] [Romans 11:6 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/romans+11:6?translation=kjv)
> *6. And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.*

 Otherwise the variable that, if you take it away, you lose salvation, is not the blood of Christ, but your worked-out righteousness. If there's still an open variable, your faith is not on the finished work of Jesus, and you’re not saved. Isn’t it wonderful that our faith rests on something solid and immovable, something that does not change based on how good or bad we are? Our faith rests on Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, not on our ability to be just good enough for God to notice our sincere efforts at obedience. Our works can have no causal relationship with salvation, or we say that Christ’s blood isn’t sufficient, and we turn the gift of God into a bilateral contract. And if we want a contract, here are the terms: “If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.” And if you keep the whole law but offend in one point, you are guilty of all (James 2:10). It’s either all Jesus or it’s the whole law, but you can’t ride both sides of the fence. Salvation is offered to us freely by faith alone (Ephesians 2:8). It’s the gift of God (Romans 6:23). And it’s the giver who pays for the gift, not the receiver.

## 5. Eternal Security

### Undetermined Open Variables Imply Self-trust

You must believe in the eternal security of the believer because the opposite necessarily implies that your faith is allocated across multiple variables that fluctuate in and out. The composition might look something like this: salvation depends on 

1. The blood of Jesus (which is a **fixed element**, because it has already been accomplished; it doesn’t change or vary; it happened) and
2. Your lived-out righteousness (which is an **open variable**, and yet to be determined).

If your salvation rests on the blood of Jesus, which is a finished, accomplished event fixed in history, nothing you do can sabotage it. It rests on a foundation, called the blood of Jesus, and there’s nothing you, or Satan, or anyone else can do to un-spill his blood. If your salvation rests on a foundation, and you can’t destroy that foundation, your salvation is secure. **The only way it is insecure is if it rests on a shaky foundation, namely, your own performance of righteousness**. And if that’s the case, you’re not trusting Jesus.

If you can lose your salvation, that means that it depends on something that you still have to fulfil. Do you see this? It took me a long time to see this, so I’m going to say it a few different ways. **If your salvation isn’t determined, then it depends on something that isn’t determined**. And since the blood of Jesus already happened, it is determined. And therefore if you can lose your salvation, it depends (at least in part) on something other than the blood of Jesus, and if that’s the case, you have another gospel (Galatians 1:6-8). Blood of Jesus + Circumcision. Circumcision is not a big deal. It’s just one thing. And yet **Paul said if your faith is apportioned between Jesus and circumcision, Christ is of no effect to you**, and you’ve got to keep the whole law (Galatians 5:2-4).

Here’s another gospel: Blood of Jesus + Good Fruits. Blood of Jesus + Sanctification. **Jesus + anything and you’re trotting down the broad way that leads to destruction**. The way is narrow. It’s narrow. *Trust Jesus alone*.

### Doubting Yourself

If you doubt, and you don't doubt God, then you do not understand the promise, because **the only thing left to doubt is yourself**, *which shows that you depend on yourself for salvation*, because you are the only variable that hasn't already been achieved. **You're the only pending confirmation**. ==The only thing that is left uncertain is how you will live==. And if that's what your faith depends on for confirmation, then you're in darkness, and you do not believe the gospel because you haven’t been enlightened by the Holy Spirit to understand it. Hear the Holy Spirit speak: “through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins” (Acts 10:43).

### Earnest Money

If the “contract” (I put quotations because it’s not a contract. It’s a gift.) that says, “I will give you eternal life” can be nullified, it’s because you have to do something to make Christ’s achievement count for you (you have to fulfil some terms and conditions to obtain it), meaning the gift wasn’t free, making God a liar, because a gift that isn’t free isn’t a gift. And it makes God a thief, because in Ephesians 1:13-14 it says,

> [!Bible] [Ephesians 1:13-14 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Ephesians+1:13-14?translation=kjv)
> 13. In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ==ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise==,
> 14. **Which is the earnest of our inheritance** until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.

If I tell my neighbors I'm going to buy their house for $100,000 I'd give them $1,000 down payment to prove I'm in earnest. If I don't come back in 30 days or however long the agreement is and buy the house, I lose the earnest money; they get to keep it, because after all they kept it off the market for a month and they might have sold it. That's what earnest money is about. The Holy Spirit is the earnest of our inheritance for we who trust Christ as the propitiation of our sins, meaning I'm going to heaven. If I don't, then the Holy Spirit is going to hell, and that's not going to happen.

It says in 1 John 5:11, “God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.” Now if God gave it to us, then it belongs to us. He’s not going to take it away from you. Eternal means forever. So if God were to give you eternal life, and then take it away, it wasn’t eternal, and that would make God a liar in saying, “God hath given to us eternal life.”

I don’t know about you, but I’m not comfortable calling God a liar. But if you say, “God can take away eternal life from anyone, even though he says he that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life,” you’re calling God a liar, and even the Bible affirms this. In 1 John 5:10-11 he says,

“10 He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.”
So if you don’t believe the record, you make God a liar. What’s the record? Verse 11:
“11 And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.”

Once you’re saved, you’re saved forever, and you can’t lose it. Romans 8:30 says, “whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.” Nobody drops out between justification and glorification. Jesus said, “And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand” (John 10:28).

You weren’t good enough to get saved, and you don’t have to be good to stay saved. We come short. We’re sinners. The only reason that we’re going to heaven is through the blood of Jesus. And if we say God can take it back, we make him a liar. And the Bible says, “In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began” (Titus 1:2). God can’t lie about this. That’s the simple gospel.

If you don’t like reading, or this was too jumbled and confusing, I encourage you to visit this link for a simple video presentation of the gospel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDEBz25lGdY

I want you to know that I wasn’t hasty in saying earlier that I don’t think you’re saved. The reason I typed all of this up is because I have a special burden for people like you, who are very familiar with the Bible, maybe grew up in church, spent knights just plowing through scripture to understand it, doesn’t take heaven and hell lightly, you’ve prayed, and you’ve prayed, and you’ve prayed, and you’ve sought out these things, and there’s still that unsettled despair that whispers, “You’re going to hell.” Less than a year ago I was in that position. “Am I saved? Am I not saved?” Who can I trust? Everyone I ask knows less Bible than I do. What about the casting off of branches in John 15? What about the 3 unsaved soils in Matthew 13? What about the turning away in 2 Peter 2:21? What about the falling away in Hebrews 6? What about the trampling underfoot the son of God in Hebrews 10? What about the “if” stipulation in Colossians 1:23? What about faith without works is dead in James 2? What about… and on and on and on with one problem text after another. And there are answers to these questions, if you have them. But what I want to talk about is your salvation.

I want to explain why I think you’re unsaved, and the reason I’m outright saying “you’re not saved” is because when I changed my beliefs to align with the 5 points of the gospel, I didn’t realize eternal security was a salvation issue, and so I can’t pin point when I actually got saved. I want you to be able to do that, and be aware of the day you believed in the Lord, if you do. So here’s my evaluation:

I suspect that you are well aware of point 1, that you are a sinner, as evinced by your writing, “I sin, … still I fall, … I am a treacherous wretch, … [I] just can't pull it off, … and [I] am way short.” You get a green check mark for this point.

As far as I can tell, you affirm point 2 as well, that the just punishment for our sin is hell, given your writing, “[I fear] that I will get what I *deserve*.” Enough said.

As far as point 3, I’m guessing you believe that Jesus’ blood was sufficient to cover your sins, IF God wants to cover your sins, so that it’s not a question of, “Did Jesus pay it all?” but “Do I qualify for the offer of salvation that Jesus paid for?” And your question is, “How do I make it count for me?” And the way you seem to have it answered in your head is, “Love God enough.” (Which I think is incorrect, but I won’t contend it yet.) So it does seems to me that you understand, “Jesus paid it all, now I just need to get in on that.” Good.

Point 4 is where I think you deviate from the gospel. Your comment is littered with clues that suggest you believe the gospel is an exchange of fruit for salvation.

“I do love Him, really really.  But not enough, it seems- because I sin.” – Not enough for what? Not enough to not sin, or not enough to merit forgiveness by not sinning?

“I constantly feel I am letting Him down, and fear He will lose patience with me.” – Again, this is ambiguous language, but I’m getting the sense that by “lose patience” you mean he’ll come to a point where he says, “I’m done forgiving you. You’ve sinned one to many times and proven that you are not fit for my Kingdom.”

“I fear that He will look at my life and see more litter than grass and that I will get what I deserve.” – This, I think, is very telling of a deep-seated belief you have that the way to escape getting what you deserve (i.e. the way to obtain grace and make Jesus’ sacrifice count for you) is if God sees more “grass” than “litter” (i.e., I’m assuming, more righteousness than sinfulness). You don’t believe that you obtain grace through faith, but by showing God how earnest you are about turning from your sin.
 
“I yearn to be acceptable to Him, but just can't pull it off.” – You think that acceptableness is something that you have to pull off. And if that’s the case, every person from Adam until now is unacceptable. That’s why Jesus came. He did not come to purchase the Holy Spirit so that we would then be empowered to live righteously enough to merit salvation. That heresy is an unintentional belittling of the once for allness of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who was the final sacrifice for sin. Paul said in 1 Corinthians 5:7, “Christ our passover is sacrificed for us.” That was the final sacrifice for sin, because it was perfect and sufficient for all who believe. Most clearly of all Hebrews 10:12 says, “But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God.” So Christ brought to an end the Old Testament sacrifices for sin. He finished the great work of atonement. His death cannot be improved on. All we have to do now is trust him for that great work. We do not add to it.

“I want to be the good soil in the parable of the sower, but am way short: more a swamp.” – Although you did not indicate any soteriological propositions here, I’m guessing you think that Matthew 13 and Luke 8 teach that the only saved soil is the good soil that produces fruit, which is not the case. I typed up a message explaining this parable, but it added too many words to an already-too-long message. So if you want me to post it, just let me know.

As I explained earlier, believing salvation is a free gift is a salvation issue because otherwise your faith isn’t all on Jesus. (Note that there is a difference between the amount of faith you have – measured as the proportion of your confidence that something will occur against your doubt – and the distribution of your faith – i.e. if you have 90% faith in Jesus and 10% faith in circumcision, so that without circumcision you despair you aren’t saved, the cross is of no effect to you.)

Here’s an example: Jonathan's faith wasn't 100% sure when he said, “perhaps God will deliver us” (1 Samuel 14:6). But it was 100% on God. There's no way he's thinking, "I'm just that good that I'll beat 20 Philistines alone with my armor bearer." All the faith in his heart rested on God to save him (which is why the KJV correctly translates “believe on” instead of “believe in” many times. επι = on). Acts 8:37: “If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest.” All your faith has to be on Jesus and nothing else to save you.

Otherwise you have the faith of Asa when he said, "Yes we need God, but we still need a treaty with Syria, or we may not win. Let me just cover all my bases." And God was not faithful to that faith, because he didn’t rely fully on the Lord (2 Chronicles 16:7-9). It’s the faith of king Saul. "I know God is with us, but Israel is starting to scatter, and we can't do it without them. I can't wait for Samuel anymore. I need God, and therefore we need to do a burnt offering, but I need them too. I'll offer the burnt offering myself" (1 Samuel 13:8-12). And God took the kingdom away from him (1 Samuel 13:13-14). Or king David’s census. "I know it's God who fights for us, but doesn't a king consider whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand? Let me just count our numbers" (1 Chronicles 21:1-4). Remember the 3 plagues David was faced with? And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it in verse 15. Split faith is a serious thing to God, and he was never faithful to the kings when they relied even partially on their own strength. David took down the giant saying, “Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.” And he said, “all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with sword and spear.” That’s the faith to have. Totally distributed 100% on God and 0% on self. That’s what Galatians 5:1-13 is all about.

I hope that you can see that your faith, up until now, has been the faith of Saul, split between God and your own strength, and if that’s the case, hear the words of Paul, “Christ is of no effect to you.” Christ is of no effect to you. Christ is of no effect to you. But he can be. And if you believe the witness of scripture now, that salvation is a free gift offered to them that believe, I want you to call on the name of the Lord today. But not yet. There’s one more thing you need to believe, and I don’t think you do.

Point 5: Eternal Security
“I constantly feel I am letting Him down, and fear He will lose patience with me.”
I get the sense that you don’t really know if you’re saved to begin with, but you’re sort of hoping you might be, indicated by the phrase, “lose patience,” as though God has patience with you right now, and as long as you don’t screw up too badly or too often, God will be patient with you, but if you don’t meet certain terms and conditions, he’ll lose patience with you. 

Remember that eternal = forever, so if God says, “I give to you the gift of eternal life,” he’d be a liar and a thief if he took it back. And so if you believe God gave you eternal life, and then one day might lose patience with you and take it back, you’ve made God a liar (1 John 5:10-11), and shown that you don’t believe the record that God gave of his Son, that he hath given to us eternal life. You don’t believe the “given” part, because if God takes something that belongs to you he’s a thief (and God’s not a thief), and you don’t believe the “eternal” part, because if God gives you something eternally and then takes it back, it was temporary, not eternal, which makes God a liar (and God’s not a liar). So you have made him a liar. Hmm… a liar and a thief. The God you have worked out in your head sounds more like Satan, who is the father of lies (John 8:44) and the thief that comes to steal, kill, and destroy (John 10:10). God is neither of those things. Believe the record of John 3:15, “whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.” If one person who believes doesn’t have eternal life, God is a liar. And if you believe that believers can lose eternal life (which is self-referentially incoherent), you don’t believe.

Now if that made sense to you, and you say, “Aha, I finally understand! Salvation is the free gift of God, and it’s eternal life,” and you put all your faith on Jesus Christ to save you, because of his shed blood on the cross, his burial, and his resurrection, and you understand you can’t lose salvation, I want to help you tell God that that’s what you believe now. Pray this:

Dear Jesus, 
I know I’m a sinner, 
I know I deserve to go to hell, 
but I believe that you died on the cross for me,
and rose again,
please save me right now,
and give me eternal life,
I’m only trusting you, Jesus,
Amen.

That’s all in the world the Bible says you have to do to be saved. Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. But if this was nothing but confusion to you, and you still don’t get it, or if you reject it, I encourage you to read the book of John, which is a book that says it was specifically written for salvation (John 20:31).

If you have any questions, let me know.
