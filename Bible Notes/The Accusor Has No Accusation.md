# The Despair Of Sin

I love this. And so want to believe it. A stumbling block for me is John 14:23.

> [!Bible] [John 14:23 - GNT](https://bible-api.com/John+14:23?translation=kjv)
> 23. Jesus answered him, "Those who love me will obey my teaching. My Father will love them, and my Father and I will come to them and live with them."

How can a man who loves Jesus disobey Him by sinning? I do love Him, really really. But not enough, it seems- because I sin. I pray often for more of Him and less of me, but still I fall. It seems an impossibility to fulfil, so I constantly feel I am letting Him down, and fear He will lose patience with me. Obedience is so hard, and yet if it is a measure of my love for Him, I am a treacherous wretch. I read that He loves me but I fear that He will look at my life and see more litter than grass and that I will get what I deserve. And that is my greatest fear. I yearn to be acceptable to Him, but just can't pull it off. My grief for this could crack boulders. I want to be the good soil in the parable of the sower, but am way short: more a swamp. Woe is me!

# The Hope Of The Gospel

## We Aren't Saved By Loving God

Loving God is a commandment, not what gets you saved. The reason verse 6 of that chapter is true, that no one comes to the Father except through Jesus, is because **we all fall short in loving God** with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength. 

Look at verse 15:
> [!Bible] [John 14:15 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/john+14:15?translation=kjv)
> 15. ==If ye love me==, keep my commandments.

> [!Bible] [John 14:21 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/John+14:21?translation=kjv)
> 21. He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, ==he it is that loveth me==: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.

Three times he emphasizes this in John 14. **If you want a close fellowship with God you’ve got to keep his commandments**. And if you want God to abide with you, and be right there with you, and be manifested to you, if you want to know God, and really see God, he’s saying, “You’ve got to keep his commandments.” He says, “I’m not going to show myself to the world (verse 17, 19, 22). I’m going to reveal myself to those that love me.”

## Sonship

If you’ve been born again, you are regenerated (from the word genes).

> [!Bible] [Titus 3:5 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Titus+3:5?translation=kjv)
> 5. Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, ==by the washing of regeneration==, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;

Sonship isn’t determined by actions and behaviors and affections. It’s dependent upon genetics. Your heavenly father being pleased with you is separate from you being in the family of God, just like with your dad growing up. Some days it’s, “Hey son, I’m proud of you. Good job.” Other days it’s, “What’s wrong with you boy? Straighten up.” But that never changes your relationship. That’s your dad. You’re in the family. 

Don’t confuse things that get you into the family, which is birth, with things that fulfil your role in the family. If we had to please God to stay sons of God, it would be meaningless the passage that reads,

> [!Bible] [Hebrews 12:6 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/hebrews+12:6?translation=kjv)
> 6. For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.

because God would just kick us out of the family. But God doesn’t do that. He disciplines us, and more and more as we grow in maturity and the knowledge of his will (Luke 12:48). We love him because he first loved us, and once we’re a child of God, nothing can separate us from the love of God (Romans 8:38-39). 

But Jesus is not taking for granted that we love him. God so loved us that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth shall have everlasting life, but do we necessarily love him? Well the measure of our love is going to be our obedience to his commandments.

## The Law Is A Mirror

While it's true that our sin shows our shortcomings in loving God, this is unrelated to our salvation. The whole point of the law hangs on the command to love God and love our neighbor, and there is no person who does not come short of that. And since sin is the transgression of the law (1 John 3:4), one of the ways you can define sin is when you do not love God with all your heart, soul, and mind. Thank God that he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him (2 Corinthians 5:21), having commended his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us (Romans 5:8).

If you think your salvation depends on how much fruit you produce for God, or how much you love God, you’ve missed it. You’re not saved. 

> "I yearn to be acceptable to Him, but just can't pull it off."

You are so close to salvation. I want to help you finally get off this rollercoaster of despair. For a lost person to be saved they MUST believe:

## The Gospel Outline

1) That they are a **sinner** (Romans 3:10-12, 23, Ecclesiastes 7:20)
2) That the punishment for their sin is **hell** (Romans 6:23, Revelation 20:14-15, 21:8)
3) That salvation was **paid for in full by Jesus Christ** (Romans 5:8, Isaiah 53:6, 1 Peter 2:24, 2 Corinthians 5:21)
4) That eternal life is a **free gift** (Romans 5:15, 6:23, Ephesians 2:8-9, Acts 11:17, Revelation 21:6, 22:17, Titus 1:2)
5) In the **eternal security** of the believer (1 John 5:10-11, Romans 8:30, Ephesians 1:13-14, John 10:28)

## 3. Sin

Let’s take these one at a time. A person that doesn’t believe he’s a sinner cannot be saved because if I’m not a sinner, there’s nothing to forgive. If there’s nothing to forgive, Jesus didn’t do anything for me. If he didn’t do anything for me, I’m not believing on him for salvation. If I’m not believing on him for salvation, I’m not saved.

## 2. Hell

You must believe that the just punishment for your sin is hell because if you don’t deserve hell, you have nothing to be saved from, and therefore will not seek the Savior, believing on him for the remission of sins.

## 3. Jesus Paid It All

You must believe that salvation was paid for in full by Jesus, because if you don’t, you must add something to the finished work of Jesus Christ, and your faith will be distributed between the blood of Jesus and XYZ. And the “Jesus plus” gospel, where Jesus gets you 98% the way there, and then you’re responsible for that last 2% based on your efforts to live more righteously, is nothing short of a works salvation, and it’s powerless to save anyone. Listen to what Paul says in Galatians 5: 

> [!Bible] [Galatians 5:1-4 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/galatians+5:1-4?translation=kjv)
> 1. Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.
> 2. Behold, I Paul say unto you, that **if ye be circumcised**, ==Christ shall profit you nothing==.
> 3. For I testify again to **every man that is circumcised**, that ==he is a debtor to do the whole law==.
> 4. ==Christ is become of no effect unto you==, whosoever of you are **justified by the law**; ye are fallen from grace.

If your faith is distributed between the blood of Jesus and some work that you have to do, let me join Paul in saying the cross is of no effect to you (Galatians 5:4). There are a lot of false teachers in the world today preaching, “Follow Jesus and thou shalt be saved,” where your salvation depends not on the cross of Christ, but on your own cross. That message is straight from hell, and it’s causing people to reject the clear teaching of the Bible that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life (John 3:15), and to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness (Romans 4:5). We’re reconciled by the blood of his cross (Colossians 1:20). If righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain (Galatians 2:21). Jesus paid it all, and strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, because no man cometh unto the Father, but by Jesus. He is the door (John 10:9), and if you’re going to be reconciled, it’s going to be because of what he did, not because of what you do. Believe that Jesus paid it all, and there’s nothing you can add to it.

## 4. Free Gift

You must believe that eternal life is a free gift because **if you try and pay for salvation, or earn forgiveness, your salvation depends on you to do what Jesus left undone**. If the qualifying element of forgiveness was, “Show God you’re earnest by giving up certain sins,” it’s no longer by grace through faith. 

> [!Bible] [Romans 11:6 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/romans+11:6?translation=kjv)
> *6. And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.*

 Otherwise the variable that, if you take it away, you lose salvation, is not the blood of Christ, but your worked-out righteousness. If there's still an open variable, your faith is not on the finished work of Jesus, and you’re not saved. Isn’t it wonderful that our faith rests on something solid and immovable, something that does not change based on how good or bad we are? Our faith rests on Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, not on our ability to be just good enough for God to notice our sincere efforts at obedience. Our works can have no causal relationship with salvation, or we say that Christ’s blood isn’t sufficient, and we turn the gift of God into a bilateral contract. And if we want a contract, here are the terms: “If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.” And if you keep the whole law but offend in one point, you are guilty of all (James 2:10). It’s either all Jesus or it’s the whole law, but you can’t ride both sides of the fence. Salvation is offered to us freely by faith alone (Ephesians 2:8). It’s the gift of God (Romans 6:23). And it’s the giver who pays for the gift, not the receiver.

## 5. Eternal Security

### Undetermined Open Variables Imply Self-trust

You must believe in the eternal security of the believer because the opposite necessarily implies that your faith is allocated across multiple variables that fluctuate in and out. The composition might look something like this: salvation depends on 

1. The blood of Jesus (which is a **fixed element**, because it has already been accomplished; it doesn’t change or vary; it happened) and
2. Your lived-out righteousness (which is an **open variable**, and yet to be determined).

If your salvation rests on the blood of Jesus, which is a finished, accomplished event fixed in history, nothing you do can sabotage it. It rests on a foundation, called the blood of Jesus, and there’s nothing you, or Satan, or anyone else can do to un-spill his blood. If your salvation rests on a foundation, and you can’t destroy that foundation, your salvation is secure. **The only way it is insecure is if it rests on a shaky foundation, namely, your own performance of righteousness**. And if that’s the case, you’re not trusting Jesus.

If you can lose your salvation, that means that it depends on something that you still have to fulfil. Do you see this? It took me a long time to see this, so I’m going to say it a few different ways. **If your salvation isn’t determined, then it depends on something that isn’t determined**. And since the blood of Jesus already happened, it is determined. And therefore if you can lose your salvation, it depends (at least in part) on something other than the blood of Jesus, and if that’s the case, you have another gospel (Galatians 1:6-8). Blood of Jesus + Circumcision. Circumcision is not a big deal. It’s just one thing. And yet **Paul said if your faith is apportioned between Jesus and circumcision, Christ is of no effect to you**, and you’ve got to keep the whole law (Galatians 5:2-4).

Here’s another gospel: Blood of Jesus + Good Fruits. Blood of Jesus + Sanctification. **Jesus + anything and you’re trotting down the broad way that leads to destruction**. The way is narrow. It’s narrow. *Trust Jesus alone*.

### Doubting Yourself

If you doubt, and you don't doubt God, then you do not understand the promise, because **the only thing left to doubt is yourself**, *which shows that you depend on yourself for salvation*, because you are the only variable that hasn't already been achieved. **You're the only pending confirmation**. ==The only thing that is left uncertain is how you will live==. And if that's what your faith depends on for confirmation, then you're in darkness, and you do not believe the gospel because you haven’t been enlightened by the Holy Spirit to understand it. Hear the Holy Spirit speak: “through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins” (Acts 10:43).

### Earnest Money

If the “contract” (I put quotations because it’s not a contract. It’s a gift.) that says, “I will give you eternal life” can be nullified, it’s because you have to do something to make Christ’s achievement count for you (you have to fulfil some terms and conditions to obtain it), meaning the gift wasn’t free, making God a liar, because a gift that isn’t free isn’t a gift. And it makes God a thief, because in Ephesians 1:13-14 it says,

> [!Bible] [Ephesians 1:13-14 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Ephesians+1:13-14?translation=kjv)
> 13. In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ==ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise==,
> 14. **Which is the earnest of our inheritance** until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.

If I tell my neighbors I'm going to buy their house for $100,000 I'd give them $1,000 down payment to prove I'm in earnest. If I don't come back in 30 days or however long the agreement is and buy the house, I lose the earnest money; they get to keep it, because after all they kept it off the market for a month and they might have sold it. That's what earnest money is about. The Holy Spirit is the earnest of our inheritance for we who trust Christ as the propitiation of our sins, meaning I'm going to heaven. If I don't, then the Holy Spirit is going to hell, and that's not going to happen.

### Calling God A Liar

It says in 1 John 5:11,
 > [!Bible] [1 John 5:11 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/1John+5:11?translation=kjv)
> 11. And this is the record, that God hath given to us **eternal life**, and this life is in his Son.

Now if God gave it to us, then it belongs to us. He’s not going to take it away from you. Eternal means forever. So if God were to give you eternal life, and then take it away, it wasn’t eternal, and that would make God a liar in saying, “God hath given to us eternal life.”

I don’t know about you, but I’m not comfortable calling God a liar. But if you say, “God can take away eternal life from anyone, even though he says he that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life,” you’re calling God a liar, and even the Bible affirms this. In 1 John 5:10-11 he says,

> [!Bible] [1 John 5:10-11 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/1John+5:10-11?translation=kjv)
> 10. He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: ==he that believeth not God hath made him a liar==; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.
> 11. And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.

Once you’re saved, you’re saved forever, and you can’t lose it. Romans 8:30 says, “*whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified*.” Nobody drops out between justification and glorification. Jesus said, “And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand” (John 10:28).

You weren’t good enough to get saved, and you don’t have to be good to stay saved. We come short. We’re sinners. The only reason that we’re going to heaven is through the blood of Jesus. And if we say God can take it back, we make him a liar. And the Bible says, “In hope of eternal life, which God, *that cannot lie*, promised before the world began” (Titus 1:2). God can’t lie about this. That’s the simple gospel.

## Internal Questions That Breed Doubt

I want you to know that I wasn’t hasty in saying earlier that I don’t think you’re saved. The reason I typed all of this up is because I have a special burden for people like you, who are very familiar with the Bible, maybe grew up in church, spent nights just plowing through scripture to understand it, doesn’t take heaven and hell lightly, you’ve prayed, and you’ve prayed, and you’ve prayed, and you’ve sought out these things, and there’s still that unsettled despair that whispers, “You’re going to hell.”

Less than a year ago I was in that position. “Am I saved? Am I not saved?” Who can I trust? Everyone I ask knows less Bible than I do. What about the casting off of branches in John 15? What about the 3 unsaved soils in Matthew 13? What about the turning away in 2 Peter 2:21? What about the falling away in Hebrews 6? What about the trampling underfoot the son of God in Hebrews 10? What about the “if” stipulation in Colossians 1:23? What about faith without works is dead in James 2? What about… and on and on and on with one problem text after another. And there are answers to these questions, if you have them. But what I want to talk about is your salvation.

## Why I Think You're Not Saved

I want to explain why I think you’re unsaved, and the reason I’m outright saying “you’re not saved” is because when I changed my beliefs to align with the 5 points of the gospel, I didn’t realize eternal security was a salvation issue, and so I can’t pin point when I actually got saved. I want you to be able to do that, and be aware of the day you believed in the Lord, if you do. So here’s my evaluation:

I suspect that you are well aware of point 1, that you are a sinner, as evinced by your writing, “I sin, … still I fall, … I am a treacherous wretch, … [I] just can't pull it off, … and [I] am way short.” You get a green check mark for this point.

As far as I can tell, you affirm point 2 as well, that the just punishment for our sin is hell, given your writing, “[I fear] that I will get what I *deserve*.” Enough said.

As far as point 3, I’m guessing you believe that Jesus’ blood was sufficient to cover your sins, IF God wants to cover your sins, so that it’s not a question of, “Did Jesus pay it all?” but “Do I qualify for the offer of salvation that Jesus paid for?” And your question is, **“How do I make it count for me?” And the way you seem to have it answered in your head is, “Love God enough.”** (Which I think is incorrect, but I won’t contend it yet.) So it does seems to me that you understand, “Jesus paid it all, now I just need to get in on that.” Good.

Point 4 is where I think you deviate from the gospel. Your comment is littered with clues that suggest you believe the gospel is an exchange of fruit for salvation.

“I do love Him, really really.  But *not enough*, it seems- because I sin.” – Not enough for what? Not enough to not sin, or ==not enough to merit forgiveness by not sinning==?

“I constantly feel I am letting Him down, and fear *He will lose patience with me*.” – Again, this is ambiguous language, but I’m getting the sense that **by “lose patience” you mean he’ll come to a point where he says, “I’m done forgiving you.** You’ve sinned one to many times and proven that you are not fit for my Kingdom.”

“I fear that He will look at my life and see more litter than grass and that I will get what I deserve.” – This, I think, is very telling of a deep-seated belief you have that **the way to escape getting what you deserve** (i.e. the way to obtain grace and make Jesus’ sacrifice count for you) **is if God sees more “grass” than “litter”** (i.e., I’m assuming, more righteousness than sinfulness). **You don’t believe that you obtain grace through faith, but by showing God how earnest you are about turning from your sin.**
 
“I yearn to be acceptable to Him, but just can't pull it off.” – You think that acceptableness is something that you have to pull off. And if that’s the case, every person from Adam until now is unacceptable. That’s why Jesus came. He did not come to purchase the Holy Spirit so that we would then be empowered to live righteously enough to merit salvation. That heresy is an unintentional belittling of the once for allness of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who was the final sacrifice for sin. Paul said in 1 Corinthians 5:7, “Christ our passover is sacrificed for us.” That was the final sacrifice for sin, because it was perfect and sufficient for all who believe. Most clearly of all Hebrews 10:12 says, “But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God.” So Christ brought to an end the Old Testament sacrifices for sin. He finished the great work of atonement. His death cannot be improved on. All we have to do now is trust him for that great work. We do not add to it.

“I want to be the good soil in the parable of the sower, but am way short: more a swamp.” – Although you did not indicate any soteriological propositions here, I’m guessing you think that Matthew 13 and Luke 8 teach that the only saved soil is the good soil that produces fruit, which is not the case. I typed up a message explaining this parable, but it added too many words to an already-too-long message. So if you want me to post it, just let me know.

### Distribution Vs Amount of Faith

As I explained earlier, believing salvation is a free gift is a salvation issue because otherwise your faith isn’t all on Jesus. (Note that there is a difference between the **amount** of faith you have – measured as the proportion of your confidence that something will occur against your doubt – and the **distribution** of your faith – i.e. if you have 90% faith in Jesus and 10% faith in circumcision, so that without circumcision you despair you aren’t saved, the cross is of no effect to you.)

#### Jonathan's 100% Reliance Despite Doubt

Here’s an example: Jonathan's faith wasn't 100% sure when he said, “perhaps God will deliver us” (1 Samuel 14:6). But it was 100% on God. There's no way he's thinking, "I'm just that good that I'll beat 20 Philistines alone with my armor bearer." All the faith in his heart rested on God to save him (which is why the KJV correctly translates “believe on” instead of “believe in” many times. επι = on). Acts 8:37: “If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest.” All your faith has to be on Jesus and nothing else to save you.

#### Split Faith Of The Kings

Otherwise you have the faith of Asa when he said, "Yes we need God, but we still need a treaty with Syria, or we may not win. **Let me just cover all my bases**." And God was not faithful to that faith, because he didn’t rely fully on the Lord (2 Chronicles 16:7-9). It’s the faith of king Saul. "I know God is with us, but Israel is starting to scatter, and **we can't do it without them**. I can't wait for Samuel anymore. I need God, and therefore we need to do a burnt offering, but I need them too. I'll offer the burnt offering myself" (1 Samuel 13:8-12). And God took the kingdom away from him (1 Samuel 13:13-14). Or king David’s census. "I know it's God who fights for us, but doesn't a king consider whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand? **Let me just count our numbers**" (1 Chronicles 21:1-4). Remember the 3 plagues David was faced with? And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it in verse 15. **Split faith is a serious thing to God**, and he was never faithful to the kings when they relied even partially on their own strength. David took down the giant saying, “Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.” And he said, “all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with sword and spear.” That’s the faith to have. Totally distributed 100% on God and 0% on self. That’s what Galatians 5:1-13 is all about.

I hope that you can see that your faith, up until now, has been the faith of Saul, split between God and your own strength, and if that’s the case, hear the words of Paul, “Christ is of no effect to you.” Christ is of no effect to you. Christ is of no effect to you. **But he can be**. And if you believe the witness of scripture now, that salvation is a free gift offered to them that believe, I want you to call on the name of the Lord today. But not yet. There’s one more thing you need to believe, and I don’t think you do.

### Point 5: Eternal Security

> “I constantly feel I am letting Him down, and fear He will lose patience with me.”

I get the sense that you don’t really know if you’re saved to begin with, but you’re sort of hoping you might be, indicated by the phrase, “lose patience,” **as though God has patience with you right now, and as long as you don’t screw up too badly or too often, God will be patient with you**, but if you don’t meet certain terms and conditions, he’ll lose patience with you. 

Remember that eternal = forever, so if God says, “I give to you the gift of eternal life,” he’d be a liar and a thief if he took it back. And so if you believe God gave you eternal life, and then one day might lose patience with you and take it back, you’ve made God a liar (1 John 5:10-11), and shown that you don’t believe the record that God gave of his Son, that he hath given to us eternal life.

You don’t believe the “given” part, because if God takes something that belongs to you he’s a thief (and God’s not a thief), and you don’t believe the “eternal” part, because **if God gives you something eternally and then takes it back, it was temporary, not eternal, which makes God a liar** (and God’s not a liar). So you have made him a liar. Hmm… a liar and a thief. The God you have worked out in your head sounds more like Satan, who is the father of lies (John 8:44) and the thief that comes to steal, kill, and destroy (John 10:10). God is neither of those things. Believe the record of John 3:15, “whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.” If one person who believes doesn’t have eternal life, God is a liar. And **if you believe that believers can lose eternal life (which is self-referentially incoherent), you don’t believe**.

## Call On The Name Of The Lord

Now if that made sense to you, and you say, “Aha, I finally understand! Salvation is the free gift of God, and it’s eternal life,” and you put all your faith on Jesus Christ to save you, because of his shed blood on the cross, his burial, and his resurrection, and you understand you can’t lose salvation, I want to help you tell God that that’s what you believe now. Pray this:

> Dear Jesus, 
> I know I’m a sinner, 
> I know I deserve to go to hell, 
> but I believe that you died on the cross for me,
> and rose again,
> please save me right now,
> and give me eternal life,
> I’m only trusting you, Jesus,
> Amen.

That’s all in the world the Bible says you have to do to be saved. Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. But if this was nothing but confusion to you, and you still don’t get it, or if you reject it, I encourage you to read the book of John, which is a book that says it was specifically written for salvation (John 20:31).

If you have any questions, let me know.

# Finally Have A Father

"Thank you" seems inadequate. I am so grateful to you. You have taken a long time to help me and have expressed yourself very clearly and with many references to the Bible. Your words have brought me to the understanding that I can do nothing to earn my salvation. It is a gift from God in His son, Jesus. I believe.

When I was a teenager He came to me when I was in despair. My own father made it clear that I had to earn his love through achievement. He died last year and his will left almost everything to my brother. I wasn't good enough. This has warped my understanding of God the Father. I am adopted, and this has left me insecure, and I have had to deal with a sense of rejection all my life; firstly from my birth mother (who rejected knowing me in adulthood too) and then by my adoptive parents for whom I am a disappointment. I have allowed these experiences to cloud my thinking.

I see now that from that moment when I prayed in earnest as a teenager and He came to me that He has been there for me, not as judge but as Saviour. I am finally free. Praise the all-forgiving, all-loyal, all-loving God!

I would love to read what you have so I might understand the Parable of the Sower much more clearly.

# Parable Of The Sower

Well I am certainly glad to count you among the saints, and that my judgment of your faith was mistaken. I guess I should exercise more caution in assuming what people believe when I’m only using clues in poetically themed messages. I should apologize for that.

Here’s what I wrote yesterday evening on the parable of the sower (it’s really rough and unedited because I had decided to leave it out before I finished, but you can read the passages yourself and test it with scripture to see if my interpretation is supported):

One thing that’s good to understand is that the fruit of the Christian is not the fruit of the Spirit. All we have to do to see this is go back to Genesis 1:11 and learn that everything bears fruit after its kind. The fruit of the womb = babies. You’re reproducing yourself. Therefore the fruit of the Spirit is love, because God is love, joy, because in his presence is the fulness of joy and the Holy Spirit is the oil of gladness, peace, because he is the prince of peace, and so on. But the fruit of the Christian is when you reproduce your faith in somebody else. It’s when you win somebody to the Lord. Proverbs 11:30 says, “The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that winneth souls is wise.” So we see that fruit = winning souls, not being virtuous. Otherwise it would be nonsense in John 15 for Jesus to say, “He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing,” because unbelievers can be virtuous. “Without me ye can do *nothing*.” No love. No joy. No peace. No patience. Have you ever seen an unbeliever be patient? It happens. But if we understand that fruit means getting people saved, it makes perfect sense, because faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God (so we quite literally cannot win souls to the Lord without Jesus’ words abiding in us). (Also notice in verse 7 he switches from, “If I abide in you,” to “if my words abide in you,” i.e. to have Jesus in us is to have his words in us, for he is the word.) So fruit = converts. (30 converts in a year makes a lot more sense than 30 love in a year, doesn’t it?)

A lot of people have varying opinions about what this parable means, even though Jesus clearly explains it. There are four types of people mentioned. Most preachers I’ve heard preach this say that 3 of them are unsaved and 1 of them is saved. I’m going to show you that 3 of them were saved and 1 of them was unsaved. The key to understanding this parable is the next parable he gives right after it. A lot of times we isolate out the parable of the sower, and we don’t look at the other part, which sheds more light on it, which is the parable of the tares in the field.

Most people think that everybody in the world is going to fall into one of these four categories, which isn’t true. As we’ll see later in the parable of the tares, there’s a fifth category of people who’ve never even heard the gospel.

THE SEED BY THE WAYSIDE (Note that I’m just capping the headings for visual organization, not emphasis. No need to yell it in your head.)
On to the parable: The seed by the wayside is the person who hears the gospel, they hear that they’re a sinner, that they deserve to go to hell, but that God loves them, and God has paid the punishment for their sins, and offers eternal life to everyone based on one thing: whether you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. These are the people who hear that preached and don’t understand it. They can’t seem to grasp the fact that Jesus paid it all, all to him I owe, sin had left a crimson stain, he washed it white as snow. They don’t seem to understand that when Jesus said “It is finished” on the cross, he doesn’t need us to add all this religion into it in order to get to heaven. They don’t understand the fact that it’s a free gift. 

THE ROMAN CANDLE CHRISTIAN
The stony place is the person who heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it (anon = immediately). Immediately he just receives it and says, “Yes, that’s wonderful, that’s great news! You mean I can be saved? You mean God will forgive all of my sins and he’ll give me a home in heaven and it’s all paid for by Jesus Christ? Glory to God! Praise the Lord! I’m saved! I’m going to heaven!” And they’re excited. They get saved, they want to be baptized, they get in church, and most people want to say he’s unsaved. It says he received the word of God. It says he was excited about it. And they get in church, but here’s the problem: 

21 Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.

This is the person who, yes they’re excited, and they’re thrilled that their name is written in the lamb’s book of life, and that no man can take him out of Jesus Christ’s hand, and that Jesus said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee, and “Their sins and iniquities will I remember no more,” and they’re thrilled to be saved, and they’re excited about it, but the problem is they don’t get rooted down. What does that mean? They’re not rooted doctrinally. They’re not rooted down in what they believe. They’re shallow. Remember, this is the shallow ground (it says that in Luke). They don’t understand the depth of Christianity. They think it’s just some little fun in games, “Wow we come to church, we dress up,” come to church, put on a tie, sing some songs, fun, positive, they’re shallow though. Look why the shallow Christian doesn’t make it:

for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.

Whoa, that’s not what he expected. He didn’t expect to be persecuted for being saved. He didn’t expect tribulation to come. He just thought it was all going to be positive. This is the person who gets saved, gets excited, gets in church, but here’s the problem: they don’t read their Bible. They’re shallow. They’re just relying on what they hear in church maybe, or maybe they read some little two verses in the morning in a little devotional, but they’re a shallow Christian. They’re not deeply rooted in the things of God. They’re not rooted doctrinally in what the Bible teaches.

The first time a policeman comes up and says, “Hey, you can’t go soul-winning here,” he’s gone. The first time a family member calls him up and says, “What do you think you’re doing? We’re Catholic!” he’s just going to quit the church. The first person that comes and protests the church, he’s offended. “I don’t want to be in any kind of battle.” As soon as old friends are mocking him for going to church, or when there’s any kind of persecution, he folds like a deck of cards. That’s the stony place. He endures for a while, but when times get tough, his finances go south, his relationships go south, his health goes south, whatever, he’s offended. He’s easily offended, easily quits. He’s not rooted. He’s not grounded, not firm, not hanging on. They fizzle out.

THE WORLDLY CHRISTIAN
14 And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.

Remember that the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life. I think the perfected fruit is a soul that you win to the Lord that wins other souls to the Lord. Not just a soul saved, but a soul discipled. Matthew 28:20: “Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.”

So you can picture a plant with some fruit starting to grow on it, maybe some flowers, and that pistil is starting to swell up and turn green, and something is happening, but they never bring it to perfection. Meaning that before they have a finished product, a ripe piece of fruit there, they end up getting chocked by the thorns, so they don’t bring any fruit to perfection. So they’re on they’re way to bearing fruit, but they don’t bring it to perfection. (Arguably “no fruit to perfection” means people in whom they planted seeds, and they’ve been slowly working on them, explaining the gospel, but before they get saved, this Christian gets busy with worldly living and never gets them saved.)

They are “are choked with cares and riches .” This is the love of money. They’re excited about church, they’re serving God, but the next thing you know they start a business (nothing wrong with starting a business), and that business becomes more important to them than church. Or they start to look at their house, or look at their car, or look at their clothes, and say, “I want more. This isn’t enough. I want to have that big fancy house. I want to have the fancy driveway. I want to have a 3-car garage. I’d like to have a boat. I’d like to have an RV. I’d like to have a 4-wheel drive.” And this becomes a desire where they’re willing to put church on the back burner. They’re willing to put soul-winning on the back burner, and they’re just going to focus on money. They want the pleasures of this life. They want the riches. Next thing you know they’re missing church, missing soul-winning, fading away, and then they’re gone. History. They got backslidden. Maybe it’s the football game, or going camping, or going to the lake, and instead of doing those things in their proper timing, they start becoming the priority, and the big thing. They don’t end up bringing fruit to perfection because they’re chocked out getting busy with everything else. He’s just so tied up in the things of this world. His job is more important to him than church, school is more important to him than church, making money is more important to him than church, watching television is more important than reading the Bible, listening to rock music is more important than praying. He’s chocked out by the cares of this world. Now this guy stays in church. He doesn’t whither up and… “Where is he?” Like the guy on shallow ground. “Boy he was excited. Where is that guy?” But this guy stays in church. This is your dead, lame church member. They come, they sit there, but they don’t win souls, they don’t produce fruit. This is a huge amount of people. After the service you can’t have a conversation with them about the things of God. Their conversations will be about sports or whatever they’re into. Church on Wednesday night? They’ve got softball. They’ve got little league, or the NBA to watch, or whatever it is. Or they’ve got to work late to buy that bigger house. Yes, they’re staying in church, but they’re worldly. 

Maybe he’s even won some souls to the Lord, but they don’t become that tree of life in Proverbs 11:30 where they start producing their own fruit. You get them saved, but you don’t teach them to observe all things whithersoever I’ve commanded them. He doesn’t have any time to help new Christians grow in their faith. He doesn’t take them soul-winning. He doesn’t help them in their Bible reading, or answer questions, or mentor them. He gets busy and he doesn’t bring any fruit to perfection.

THE SOUL-WINNER
Then there’s the good ground. They do bring forth fruit. They go out soul-winning, they’re shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace, they cease not to teach and preach Jesus Christ from house to house, they’re the man in Psalm 92:14: “They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing;”

INTERPRETATION
Here’s the interpretation people walk away with: everybody’s unsaved except the good ground. When the true interpretation is that the only guy who’s unsaved is the wayside. Because everybody else received the gospel and believed it, and therefore got saved. There are plenty of people who are saved, and immediately when tribulation comes they get offended. Are we going to say that every Christian is fruitful? No way.

THEY BELIEVED FOR A WHILE
I think the reason people think the two soils that received the word (which, by the way, gives them power to become the sons of God, John 1:12) but didn’t produce fruit are unsaved is because in Luke 8:13 is says of the shallow Christian, “and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.” They believed for a while. What does it mean? First of all, the fact that they believed makes them saved period, because John 3:18 says this: “He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.” Christ will say, “Depart from me, I never knew you,” not “depart from me, I used to know you.” There are two groups of people: those who believe, and those who hath not believed.

Especially when you look at it in context, that it says of the seed by the wayside, “Lest they should believe and be saved” (Luke 8:12). Making it clear that those who believe are saved. And then it talks about those people who for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away. First of all, what this verse does not say is, “They stopped believing.” That statement is not here. You can see that implication, and I get that, but there’s not an outright statement that says, “They believed for a while, and then they stopped believing.” It says, “They believed for a while, and then in time of temptation fell away.” Fall away from church, fall away from serving the Lord, fall away from any chance of bringing forth fruit. They don’t want the tribulation, they don’t want the persecution.

So what does it mean they believed for a while? Believing is in degrees. There are degrees of believing. The disciples said, “Increase our faith” (Luke 17:5). The Bible says we go “from faith to faith” (Romans 1:17). The Bible says that we would increase and abound in faith (2 Corinthians 10:15, 2 Corinthians 8:7). “I believe; help thou mine unbelief” (Mark 9:24). And the guy did the miracle. Have more faith. Grow in faith. Someone who has the faith to confess Christ as their Savior and believe that he’s the Son of God and ask him to save him, it doesn’t necessarily mean that they have the faith to sell everything that they have, and move across the country, and follow the will of God for their life. Abraham had the faith to do that, and that’s a lot of faith. Not everyone who gets saved has that much faith. They may not have the faith to pay their tithe. They may not have to faith to stand up for what’s right. They may not have the faith that God’s going to come through when they need him to come through, and so they might feel like they have to take things into their own hands or something like that. We all have lapses in faith all the time. If we all had ultimate faith we’d be better Christians. We wouldn’t have any doubt or worries because we’d say, “Hey, God’s going to take care of us.” It takes faith to have a lot of kids, because that’s a lot of mouths to feed. A lot of Christians don’t have that faith. Faith in Christ doesn’t mean you have the faith to excel in these other areas of Christian life. I believe Luke 8:13 means their faith takes a nosedive when trials and tribulations come, and they have no faith in God to protect them. When they got saved they had the faith to confess Christ, but then when it comes to believing the promises of God through temptations and tribulations— what about the promise where God said he wouldn’t tempt you above that ye are able? They don’t believe that. It’s not saying that they stopped believing that Jesus is the Son of God. I think it makes more sense, given the context of they’re going through trials and persecutions and tribulations, that they stopped believing the promises of God. 

SUMMERY
The parable of the sower talks about people who heard the word of God and didn’t understand it (common situation), people who got excited about church but as soon as the hard times come they fold like a deck of cards (very common situation), people who got into pleasure and money and having fun, and they got out of church and faded away (super common situation), and people who are winning 30 people to the Lord every year (less common situation). Because the good soil has a good heart. And they’re rooted, and they’re not going anywhere, they can handle the testing, they can handle the storms, and they’re going to continue to bring forth fruit year after year until their life is over or until Christ returns. Those are the four categories.
