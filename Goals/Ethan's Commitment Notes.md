## I Test Criticism by Scripture

The reason I won't sing is because somebody's perception of me demands I don't be a hypocrite. Nobody wants to betray the box that other people put around them because we want to act consistently with how they see us because how they see us resulted from how we behaved at one time, and if we act differently than that we're a hypocrite. I don't want to sing after provoking someone to anger because they will think, "Grr, how dare you be unaffected by the problems you caused me. You're in the wrong and you're going on your merry way without making it right, acting spiritual when you're not."

Learn to handle it like Pastor Jimenez.

In one sense, this world of social media is unrealistic because we simply can’t deal seriously with thousands of opinions about ourselves.

[How Do I Process Personal Criticism](https://www.desiringgod.org/interviews/how-do-i-process-personal-criticism)

In Law there are two questions of a case. The first is the innocence or guild of the defendant of doing what the plaintiff accused him of doing, and the second is whether it was against the law, and what the punishment should be. So you have questions of fact and questions of law. If somebody accuses me of something, I don't need to test the question of fact. I already know. What I need to do is test it against the word of God to determine whether or not it was wrong of me to do it. "That was mean." I can't dispute that somebody may have taken something I said offensively whether or not I meant to offend them. When you correct people, it may make them feel bad. I won't dispute the accusation, the question of fact. But what I will dispute is that it was unjust of me to be mean, or that I have wronged that person. It isn't a sin to be mean according to the need of the moment. Jesus was mean according to the need of the moment. And so what I need to do is say, "What my meanness called for? Was it appropriate? Did I do diligence to mitigate the meanness of my rebuke? Was I even supposed to mitigate the meanness of my rebuke?" Answers to those questions are too often assumed, but the Bible doesn't assume them the same way popular Christianity does.

Test accusations by God's word, and remain unaffected by the specific approvals or non-approvals of the people who's judgments are out of step with the Bible. Care about approval insofar as their judgments align with the word of God, and otherwise don't let it bother you. Don't feel guilty because of somebody's disapproval of you. There will always be people with their own constructs of what godliness looks like, and you are bound not to fit into their mold, and you can't let the weight of their disapproval keep you from knowing in your own heart that you are right before God, you haven't transgressed, and you can continue to be happy in God and praise God and offer prayers of thanksgiving.

Why is that hard? There's a certain tension that social pressure demands when conflict is present. ==A normal person who just exchanged rude words in a restaurant would feel like they would be representing Christianity poorly if they sat down and said, "Let's pray,"== and thanked the Lord without a second thought. We are going to be stereotyped as a heartless, self-righteous hypocrite who should have been showing love but instead engaged in conflict and defended themselves. But Jimenez knows that engaging in conflict isn't ungodly, and it doesn't misrepresent Christianity, because ==God's own Christ engaged in conflict==. So we need to not buy into the frame that people set for us. Pious: Making or constituting a hypocritical display of virtue.

I am not validated by the approval of men
**I am not troubled by disapproval**

I don't let conflict embezzle my peace
I keep composure after conflict
I remain proud of God's righteousness after conflict
I remain a spiritual leader after conflict
I lead myself piously after conflict
I don't let conflict infringe my virtue
I am not guilty because of conflict
**I continue displaying virtue after conflict**

Embezzling is when somebody's goods are temporarily entrusted to another person, and that person converts ownership of those goods to himself. I'm not one of those people who says, "Peace in the midst of conflict." Wrong. Conflict happens, and you are allowed to engage in it. So there are times when you will temporarily cede peace for the sake of whatever goal is at the end of conflict, and when conflict is over, I immediately recover my peace. I immediately revel in the goodness of God. I immediately exult in the Lord. I immediately act as though nothing ever happened. I don't stay angry. I don't let it bother me that somebody said a rude thing to me, and I don't let it sear my conscience that I said a mean thing back. Jesus did not revile in return when he was reviled, but he always had the greater response. 

"Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread. But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?"

Did you see that? He turned it around on them. You're allowed to be firm against people's attacks and say, "Get out of here you fag hag. Let's pray."

==Instead of being ashamed and contrite after conflict, you should be proud and lead== with your chest out. Imagine it was a battle in ancient Israel, and God's people were set against his enemies, and you stood your ground, and you lead the army with firmness, and now you are David coming back from battle with songs being sung about you and everyone rejoicing in the strength of the Lord. We're still in a battle, not with flesh and blood, not with steal and mortar, but a battle of words. ==Our sword is God's word. That very symbolism is a picture of conflict, not peace==. Fight the good fight of faith, not the peaceful negation of faith. So you can stand up after conflict with your head held high, still composed, confident as ever, godly as ever, and say, "Let's pray." Don't be worried about how other people think you're not godly by virtue of conflict. They're wrong.

"Be ye angry, and sin not. Let not the sun go down on your anger, and give not the devil an opportunity."
