This phase all started with six flags passes that my brother bought. We started going on Saturdays, and I would invite people as much as possible because I wanted to get as much use out of my pass as I could. I didn't see it as a waste of time, but as something to redeem the passes that we bought to make it worth it. That's what catalyzed the best year of my life.

Something happened around November 2022 that fundamentally changed my personality from being a fun-loving outgoing friend to an angry, hermit-minded lone ranger. I believe it was punishment from God for the sins I committed with Mariana.

I don't like who I am right now, and haven't since that first argument I had with Rich.
