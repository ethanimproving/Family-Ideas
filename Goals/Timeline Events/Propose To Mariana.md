While there haven't been recent surveys directly asking women about their **preferred** diamond cuts, there is strong market data and industry reports suggesting which cuts are most popular. Here's what we know:

**Most Popular Diamond Cuts:**

- **Round Brilliant:** This reigns supreme, consistently holding over 60% of the market share for engagement rings (GIA data). Its classic look, maximum brilliance, and versatility contribute to its enduring popularity.
- **Princess Cut:** Following closely behind, princess cuts offer a modern square shape with excellent brilliance and affordability, making them a popular choice.
- **Cushion Cut:** Blending brilliance with a square or rectangular shape with soft corners, cushion cuts offer a vintage vibe and are known for their larger facets that showcase fire (rainbow colors).
- **Oval Cut:** Gaining traction in recent years, oval cuts provide an elongated brilliance similar to round stones but with a unique, flattering silhouette.
- **Emerald Cut:** Known for its elegant, Art Deco aesthetic and larger table (top facet), emerald cuts prioritize clarity and step-cut facets over sparkle.

**Important Note:**

These are just the most popular options, and **personal preference ultimately reigns supreme**. What a woman truly desires in a diamond comes down to individual style, taste, and finger shape. Some may prioritize brilliance, while others prefer unique shapes or vintage aesthetics.

**Alternatives to Popularity:**

Instead of solely relying on popularity, consider these factors when choosing a diamond:

- **The woman's individual style:** Does she prefer classic, modern, vintage, or something unique?
- **Finger shape:** Some cuts complement certain finger shapes better than others.
- **Setting preferences:** Certain cuts work better with specific settings.
- **Budget:** Different cuts vary in price due to factors like rarity and waste during cutting.

Remember, the most important aspect is choosing a diamond that resonates with the woman who will wear it.
