While there haven't been recent surveys directly asking women about their **preferred** diamond cuts, there is strong market data and industry reports suggesting which cuts are most popular. Here's what we know:

**Most Popular Diamond Cuts:**

- **Round Brilliant:** This reigns supreme, consistently holding over 60% of the market share for engagement rings (GIA data). Its classic look, maximum brilliance, and versatility contribute to its enduring popularity.
- **Princess Cut:** Following closely behind, princess cuts offer a modern square shape with excellent brilliance and affordability, making them a popular choice.
- **Cushion Cut:** Blending brilliance with a square or rectangular shape with soft corners, cushion cuts offer a vintage vibe and are known for their larger facets that showcase fire (rainbow colors).
- **Oval Cut:** Gaining traction in recent years, oval cuts provide an elongated brilliance similar to round stones but with a unique, flattering silhouette.
- **Emerald Cut:** Known for its elegant, Art Deco aesthetic and larger table (top facet), emerald cuts prioritize clarity and step-cut facets over sparkle.

**Important Note:**

These are just the most popular options, and **personal preference ultimately reigns supreme**. What a woman truly desires in a diamond comes down to individual style, taste, and finger shape. Some may prioritize brilliance, while others prefer unique shapes or vintage aesthetics.

**Alternatives to Popularity:**

Instead of solely relying on popularity, consider these factors when choosing a diamond:

- **The woman's individual style:** Does she prefer classic, modern, vintage, or something unique?
- **Finger shape:** Some cuts complement certain finger shapes better than others.
- **Setting preferences:** Certain cuts work better with specific settings.
- **Budget:** Different cuts vary in price due to factors like rarity and waste during cutting.

Remember, the most important aspect is choosing a diamond that resonates with the woman who will wear it.

### Kelley Marbach

Siri was raving about Kelley's ring after they got married. "Props to Zach for her ring! It was a big honking ring. He did a good job."

# Where To Propose

Kritika says to propose at the Northern Lights. See how magical it is. When can you see the aurora borealis. Nobody can beat nature at the end of the day.

Actions need to speak. You can say anything with your words.
