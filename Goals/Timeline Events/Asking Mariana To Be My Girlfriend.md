Hey I want to tell you something. Before I met you I thought I was going to be with someone ...

I meant to prepare something beautiful to tell you but he truth is when I'm with you every moment is beautiful. Words don't make it beautiful. Words can only describe what already is beautiful. And for me, the most beautiful thing that I will spend my life trying to express is h

You are the greatest adventure of my life. I don't want to be with you because I can imagine a life with you, but because I can't imagine my life without you. I can't imagine my future without you in it. You are the most incredible woman I could be blessed with. Nobody will support me like you. You support me unconditionally. Nobody listens to me like you, and cares about my beliefs like you. Nobody makes me laugh like you, and smile like you. Nobody makes me want to be better like you, and at the same time makes me feel completely received and accepted like you. Nobody makes me comfortable like you. Nobody argues like you. Nobody has the same sparkle in their eyes as you. And there's nobody in the whole world or all of history that I want to be with besides you.

I wanted to pick a better spot to ask you this, but I realize that I don't want to wait. It wasn't the spot that makes it special. It was our conversation last night. And I think it's time to take our relationship to the next level. Will you be my girlfriend.

I would be the craziest person in the world if I let you slip through my fingers. I want you to be my girlfriend.

I trust you. I think it's time to take our relationship to the next level. Will you be my girlfriend?

I haven't asked you this because I care too much about the time and the place, but the more that I'm with you it doesn't matter where we are.

And then you came along, and you were the most caring, selfless, kind, funny, adventurous, amazing girl I've ever met. 

- The way thay we argue.
- The way that you listen.
- The way that you have a sparkle in your eye when you see Disney or Harry Potter.

who would only like me because I go

I wanted to come up with something cute to say but the truth is that I can't wait any longer. 

stuck with someone that I'm not crazy about. 

I wanted to wait for the right time to ask you this, but I think the right time isn't about the right weather, or setting, or environment. The right time is when we are both

The right time for anything in life is when you feel ready, not when the conditions are right.

I've been wanting to ask you this for a long time,
