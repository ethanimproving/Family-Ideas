I had 4 really good interviews at the end of Bootcamp. I wanted to stay at Improving, but AA selected me as their first candidate. All of the other Bootcampers were offered $45k, except Paloma at $40k, and Jennifer at $35k. They offered me $55k, which is low for the industry, but for me it was the light at the end of the tunnel. I was thrilled that my life was finally coming together. It was more than any of my siblings were making, and it was my very first job ever. I was excited to get started.
