Apparently you're not allowed to date within the company. 😂 I was fired for a conglomerate of unprofessional behavior. I wrote jokes in enterprise code, took advantage of the recreation on campus a lot, had a few too many calls with a particular coworker (😍). In the end I asked what I was being fired for, and my senior manager just said, "All of it. The amount of stuff we found was too overwhelming not to do anything." And you know what? No hard feelings. Stacey always took care of me. She promoted me 3 times in 4 years. She doubled my salary in 2 years. And we always had fun conversations in the office. I don't have any disposition towards her whatsoever, she was great. I violated some rules, and she treated fairly. Lesson learned, time to move on. I have nothing but gratitude looking back.

# Blessings On Blessings

Everything bad that happens to me seems to result in a major improvement in my life. After I crashed my [[Goals/Timeline Events/Car Crash|2013 Corolla]], within 4 days I had a 2021 Corolla with Adaptive Cruise Control. Insurance paid me more for my 2013 than I paid for it, and the whole upgrade only cost me about $3,000, which I already had in my car replacement budget. The crazy thing is that earlier that year I was in Hanover MI for a wedding, and while I was driving the car rental I said to Mariana, "I'm in love with this adaptive cruise control. It would make my commute so much easier. But my car is in good condition, it will probably be at least 10 years before I can get it." And then what happened? My car gets completely totaled slamming into the side wall at 80mph on the tollway, not another car was involved, and I walked away without a scratch on me. In the moment it felt like a bad situation, but in the end it turned out to be a huge blessing.

## Breo

A huge blessing that came out of me losing my job is that I weaned myself off of my inhaler medicine that cost $90/month. Without insurance, the price was closer to $400/month, so I decided to ration the 30 days supply I had left and try to get by. 60 days later, I still have 16 days supply and I'm not taking it anymore.

I started nebulizing something my mom gave me called VBM Guard, and immediately my lings felt cleared. I kept using it every day for awhile, and it seems to have mostly reset my lungs from the [[Ragweed Allergies Sep 19-Oct 19#4. Dry Cough|post-covid bronchial hypersensitivity]]. If I was still taking my medicine daily, I never would have noticed the difference and probably would have been taking it for years, if not the rest of my life. This has saved me a huge hassle in my life and a lot of money long-term.

## Algorithms

Another positive thing that happened is the need for [learning algorithms](https://professional-journal-client.vercel.app/professional-journal/algorithms/algorithms-bootcamp/#solutions). I've known this is my weakest interviewing skill for awhile now, and I've been wanting to hone in on it, but other priorities keep pushing it back. I could make a LOT more money if I know advanced algorithms, but it's so tedious to learn it. Well, tedious aside, it became necessary to choke the studying down. I learned a TON.

It was time for me to progress my career 2 years ago, but I was too lazy to do it. And this year I was prioritizing my house so that I could propose to Mariana. Well, that got pushed back at least 2 months, but in the grand scheme of things, it may be for the better.

## Application Process

What I'm very excited about is how much I learned about the application process. I setup a Python pot to automatically apply for positions on LinkedIn, downloaded a Chrome extension to auto-fill manual applications, and most importantly, learned how to check my resume against ATS to get it into the hands of hiring managers. I wrote a blog post about it called, "[How To Apply For Jobs In 2024](https://professional-journal-client.vercel.app/professional-journal/how-to-apply-for-jobs-in-2024/)."
