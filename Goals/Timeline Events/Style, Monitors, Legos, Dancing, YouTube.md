After getting my job, there was a natural climbing of Maslow's Hierarchy. I had some room to breathe. Covid hit and I used my stimulus check to get two 4K monitors. I created a couple more videos for Amplify Ministries. I learned a dance with Faith. I started buying shoes from Macy's now that I had some money. Shirts from Amazon. I bought portable monitors to be a digital nomad. I did some Spring Cleaning. I made videos of my Legos so I could encapsulate the memories in stories. I got my passport. I was working from Home with Caleb.
