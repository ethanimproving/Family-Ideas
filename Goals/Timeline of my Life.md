Download the Standalone [Timeglider GitHub repository](https://github.com/tkuhn/timeglider) and serve it with VS Code Live Server. Ask ChatGPT if it can write an Obsidian Plugin to incorporate Timeglider as it's own file, like Excellidraw does. In the meantime, simply add it to the digital garden client repository. There can be multiple files: History, Plans, Alternative Plans. You can go back and look at all the timelines that you imagined that never came to fruition. Like marrying Amy, or interning for a coding position. That way it's not conflated with what actually happened, but you can still live intentionally and make plans for your life.

Another idea is to render a dataview table from individual notes, and compile that table into a timeline. Look at `table.html` in the repo.

```dataview
table start-date as Start_Date, end-date as End_Date
from "Goals/Timelines"
sort Start_Date desc
```

## Standalone Dataviewjs

### Prompts

I want you to act as a principle software engineer with  with decades of experience in high-end companies, such as Google, Amazon, and others. You also helped work on created the Dataview plugin for Obsidian, and you are the former creator of the Timeglider app that was bought out by Preceden. I will ask you to write a specific script using dataviewjs and you will implement my requirements. Do you understand?

### Feature Requirements

As a former creator of Timeglider, you are aware that the Timeglider app (available at https://github.com/tkuhn/timeglider/blob/master/js/timeglider.min.js) uses the following JSON data to render a timeline:

```json
{  
  "id": "jshist-self",  
  "title": "Self",  
  "description": "Self, one of the inspirations for Javascript's simplicity, is created at Xerox PARC ",  
  "startdate": "1986-01-01 12:00:00",  
  "importance": "40",  
  "date_display": "none",  
  "link": "http://selflanguage.org/",  
  "icon": "flag_green.png"  
}
```


I want you to write a `dataviewjs` query that uses the notes in my Obsidian vault at the directory `Goals/Timelines/`. Instead of JSON data, it will take fields from the frontmatter of the note. Here is an example note:

```
---
dg-publish: true
start-date: 1996-03-22
end-date: 2009-03-08
title: Age of innocence
icon: circle_green.png
date-limit: year
importance: 50
link: 
---

"For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died." This was the period in which I thought my biggest problem was that I had no problems. I stole money from my brother to buy Legos, and I cheated in school from 4th grade onward, but I had no puncture in my conscience. I didn't know the commandments of God, and so I didn't understand sin.
```

Below are the requirements for the dataview:

1.  Timeline Format: The timeline should be displayed as a horizontal bar, with time progressing from left to right. Each event should be represented by a box or icon on the timeline, with its position on the timeline determined by its date.
    
2.  Zooming and Scrolling: The timeline should allow users to zoom in and out to view events in more or less detail. Users should also be able to scroll left and right to navigate the timeline.
    
3.  Date Ranges: The timeline should be able to display events over various date ranges, such as years, months, weeks, days, or even hours. Users should be able to choose the date range that best fits their needs.
    
4.  Categories: The timeline should allow users to categorize events based on different criteria, such as project phases, event types, or people involved. Users should be able to color-code categories for easy identification.
    
5.  Event Details: Each event on the timeline should link to a note in `Goals/Timelines/` using Obsidian Wikilinks.
    
6.  Filtering: The timeline should allow users to filter events based on various criteria, such as category, date range, or keyword. Users should be able to apply multiple filters at once.
    
7.  Search: The timeline should allow users to search for events based on keywords or phrases. The search should return all events that match the query.

Walk me through how to integrate TimelineJS with dataviewjs for visualizing the timeline based on the following table:

```
TABLE start-date, end-date, title, icon, date-limit, importance, link
FROM "Goals/Timelines"
SORT start_date ASC
```

## Obsidian Plugin

```dataview
TABLE start-date, end-date, title, icon, date-limit, importance, link
FROM "Goals/Timelines"
SORT start_date ASC
```

```dataviewjs
const timelineData = dv.pages("#timelineofmylife").frontmatter.map((item) => {
  const startDate = new Date(item['start-date']);
  const endDate = new Date(item['end-date']);
  const title = item.title;
  const icon = item.icon;
  const dateLimit = item['date-limit'];
  const importance = item.importance;
  const link = item.link;

  return {
    start_date: {
      year: startDate.getFullYear(),
      month: startDate.getMonth() + 1,
      day: startDate.getDate(),
    },
    end_date: {
      year: endDate.getFullYear(),
      month: endDate.getMonth() + 1,
      day: endDate.getDate(),
    },
    text: {
      headline: title,
      text: '',
    },
    icon: {
      url: icon,
    },
    date_limit: dateLimit,
    importance: importance,
    link: {
      href: link,
    },
  };
});
```

Nexusfont came in handy in sorting through fonts, and X-Mouse was useful because my Microsoft mouse was incompatible with AE scrolling. If I was just clipping a video, I used Avidemux. I created a YouTube channel called "Amplify Ministries" that grew to 5,000 subscribers. Unfortunately it hosted the false teachers.

### First soul saved!

2017-08-23

I got my first soul saved today! Chris did not show up at 1:30 like I told him, to no surprise. I wasn't sure that I had the gospel memorized well enough, but after going through it in my head twice, I prayed for boldness in utterance, and that Christ would teach me what to say, and that the Holy Spirit would speak through me, and I went out to Azinia Street and knocked my first door. The guy who answered was a friendly person who worked at a church. Being unsure that we was going to heaven, he denied my offer to hear the gospel. I said, "Do you know 100% that you're going to heaven?" He replied with a laugh, "No." I said, "Can I just take a couple of minutes and show you from the Bible how you can know that 100%?" He said, "I'm good." "I said, "No problem. Let me just leave you with this one verse," and followed Steven Anderson's script. He wished me luck on my journey as I said to him, "You have a great day." Many doors did not answer, and probably few people were even home. The next door that was open before I knocked, the lady who lived there came to it and shouted, "What do you want?" I said, "The reason I'm here is because I'm a Christian, and Jesus Christ, before he went up into heaven, commanded us to preach the gospel to ever creature that some might hear, and believe, and be saved." She just closed the door, and I thought, "Cool. So this is what it means to suffer shame for the sake of the gospel.  
The next person I talked to came home as I was knocking on his door. I greeted them, right before the man said, "What can I do for you?" He seemed a little irritable, but I proceeded. He said he went to church, and I said, "More important than going to church..." and followed the script. He said he knew 100% that he was going to heaven because he was saved. I said, "And how do you get saved?" "Believe on Jesus." I said, "And can you ever lose it," he answered, "Well you're not supposed to." In retrospect, I should've probed the question further, but since his two children just got home from school and he seemed irritable, I just said, "That's right, you can't lose it. Hallelujah brother. I'll see you in heaven. You have a great day."  
The next person to answer was a girl named Melony. She listened to the whole gospel, agreeing point by point, and right at the end when I was asking her, "Let me ask you this, and what's your name by the way? Melony, do you believe taht you are a sinner?" "Yes." Do you believe that hell is the punishment for our sins?" She said, "Sort of." So I went back to Revelation 21:8 and Romans 6:23, and explained it a couple of different ways, but she just couldn't wrap her head around it. I talked about how punishment isn't only determined by the magnitude of the sin, but the dignity of the one whom you offended. I explained how if we were to be judged by the law, based on how good we are, none of us would measure up, and so whether we've lied or murdered, we all end up in hell. We went to James 2 where it talks about being a transgressor if you offend in one point. And she was an agreeable personality, and I couldn't gotten her to pray my prayer, and when I said, "Do oyu believe this verse?" She said, "Yeah." And so when I said, "So do you believe that hell is the punishment for our sins?" She said, "Yeah," unconvincingly, and I probed further, and she still didn't get it. So I wished her a great day and left her with one final verse: John 3:16. She totally believed the rest of the gospel. But the rest was incompatible with point two, that we deserve hell, and I didn't want to put her in doublethink, and I moved on.  
The next guy that opened was a guy named Steven. I won him to the Lord, and he was really excited about it. He had a cool personality, but it was a textbook presentation of the gospel. I couldn't have asked for a more receptive fellow. He started out my question of, "What is it that determines whether you go to heaven or hell" with, "Repent of your sins?" I said, "Let's see what the Bible says," and turned him to Acts 16:30-31. When we read it together, he believed it right away. I asked him, "Did that say you have to go to c good church? Live a good life? Repent of your sins?" I asked him, "What did it say we have to do?" He said, "Believe." And from there, I pretty much knew he was going to be saved. I explained the rest of the gospel, he understood it perfectly, answered every question right, he understood about calling God a thief and a liar by saying you can lose eternal life, and he prayed with me. It was amazing. Best feeling ever. Then I told him to bring me his Bible, and said that John is a great place to start reading. (It was the revised Standard Version.) Then I explained that baptism was the next step, and how it's like putting a ring on your finger. it's not what makes you married, but if I say, "I want to put a ring on that finger," you mean, "I want to marry you." I told him that I'd love to see him at Northlake Baptist Church. and taht he could put that ring on his finger, as it were, and explained how baptism is a symbolism of being buried with Christ, and raised to walk in the newness of life, and I said, "If I never see you again, where will I see you for sure?" And he said, "Heaven." And I said, "You have a good one." And he blessed also, saying, "You too man," with gratitude.  
The next guy I talked to was a Jew. He fully understood the gospel, was raised a Catholic, and I think we was a reprobate. I made the mistake of talking to him for the remainder of my time. He was a very friendly dude, but a relativist, saying that once you take out all of man's tampering with Religious Bibles, they all say the same thing. I showed him over and over how that is not so, and that his Torah was in my Bible, and we talked for a long time about many things, and at some points, when I talked about God sending Jesus Christ to die for us, he got quiet, but he just wouldn't believe it. And he just wouldn't believe that Jesus Christ was God's son. Eventually, in the middle of one of his sentences, I said, "Do you have the time?" And he said, "It's five." I said, "Hey, I really appreciate you talking to me. You have a great day," And I bid him farewell.

### I'm saved!

2017-08-23

I was actually saved a few months before this date, but it was the morning of the day I determined to go soul-winning that I called upon the name of the Lord one final time, saying,  
"Dear Jesus, I know I'm a sinner,I know I deserve to go to hell,But I believe that you died on the cross to pay for my sins,And rose again,Please save my right now,And give me eternal life.I'm only trusting you, Jesus.Amen."

### CADD Training

2018-01-18 - 2018-03-02 #laborhours 

The Lord will not give me this job. Lose your anxiety, Ethan. This is my rod. A forfeited opportunity because of my sin. Nevertheless, perhaps the Lord will be gracious with me. I will be as Jonathan and not Saul. I will work hard to get this job, and if the Lord be pleased, then I will have success, and if not, then I will be edified.  

I spent the month of February learning MicroStation to be a CADD Technician, learning the drawing tools, annotations, dimensioning, bridge components, I even learned VBA to create custom tools, and I got an interview, and I didn't get the job, and supposedly it was because I interjected him to much. He told Caleb I was annoying. So I was upset about that. And I thought, "Well, there are multiple kinds of value in the world, and the difference between a 30K salary and a 6 figure income is a matter of learning how to let technology work for us." <mark class="hltr-yellow">I decided just to catalog every good and service I've consumed in the last 20 years, figure out what makes it valuable, and calculate the value of every job that lies underneath the production process.</mark> So basically I'm not doing anything. Somebody needs to give me a swift kick in the butt and say, "Get to work."  

Technology is the difference between a farmer creating enough food for 10 people in the 1800's and 100 families now. And 1000 families 50 years from now once we start vertical farming techniques. Everybody produces a certain amount of value with their time, and there are ways we can do it more efficiently, and all it takes is technology and education.

### Labor Hours Project

2018-03-03 - 2018-04-13

This was a project where I tried to quantitatively evaluate the value of labor hours based not on market pay, but production value. I tried making a formula like the Black Scholes model for understanding the value of option derivatives in the stock market. It was an extremely interesting project, but I didn't have the time to bring it to fruition. It remains unfinished in my Resource Library under the "Wisdom" folder.

### Crush on Amy Peavey

2018-08-10 - 2020-02-25

I discovered hidden affections for Amy when I became sick with the flu one day and struggled to cease fantasizing about her. I found it a most absurd notion to be so fond of a girl so much older than me, but the heart wants what it wants.  
"She's adorned with beauty, grace and charm accompany her face, her words are clothed with wisdom, her zeal for God is manifest in her mission, her voice is contained in shamefaced obedience, and she loves God. Against such qualities it is futile for me to convince myself that an 8 year gap of converging the womb is important."

2018-12-23

I went over to shake her hand, but she was so stiff it felt too mechanical, so I yanked her over and she lost balance. I stretched forth my hand to stay her upright and tried redeeming the awkward fuddling interaction by saying, "I'm going for the hug."

### Attend Stedfast Baptist Church

2019-01-13

This morning I felt like I was leaving everything I know. Tonight I feel like I'm coming back to a wasteland. All the activity, all the people, all of the lifeblood and energy is back in Fort Worth. I left a group of brothers in great fellowship and likeminded company, and I walked into my house to my family watching a reality TV show with brainwashing music. The Spirit in Fort Worth is amazing. The spirit here is dead. The spirit there is exciting and encouraging, and stimulating. There's nothing at home except a bed. It's quiet. I usually have a headache on Sunday afternoons as I take a nap. I put forth my hands to work for the Lord this afternoon and I feel great now.  
Pastor Shelley is a really great guy. His preaching is on par with Pastor Anderson's, and he's extremely humble. He greeted me no different than any of the brethren. Brother Jason from Garland, Brother Ryan, Brother Media dude, Brother Jacob from east Texas, Brother Jared (Jacob's brother), Brother Chris (Jacob's roomate, moved here in September from Michigan), Brother Canadian dude (also moved here in September), Brother Michael, Brother Elijah, Brother Ian, Brother Tony, Brother Steven. I love all the people there. Pastor Shelley was a software developer for a medical company. He told me he's a self-taught developer, and even created a curriculum for Elliot Ray to help him get an actual career. He was making something like 103K at his job. Who is my brother? And who is my mother? It truly is the spirit of comradery that I know at Stedfast.  
I'm motivated now more than ever to wake up early and learn React. With Pastor Shelley saying that it's a good career that's basically all about how hard you work, and you can get good pay if you work hard, I feel driven to show myself approved by my labor. He said it's like anything else, you have to be self-motivated to do it, and excel at it. He really was just a positive guy and full of life. Very upbeat and welcoming. I feel like I've known him for years. He just immediately treated me like a friend.

### Starting to like Nexus

2019-02-04

I had spoken with her on Sunday and she friended me on Facebook Monday at noon to entice me to come to the potluck board game fellowship. I only briefly met her the week before when Ashley introduced us. She moved to Fort Worth for church over and against Arizona because she heard there were more single guys here, and there are many. Jacob Plant confessed to me on the day I met her that he doesn't really talk to the women in the church, as though wishing he had the courage. He also talks about Nexus, and I think he likes her, which makes me like her too.  
I feel like Jacob and Nexus would make a better pair than the two of us, but something in my male nature wants to compete for her because I think that I can. He's afraid to talk to her, and I'm not afraid to talk to her, and that makes me alpha. I think I could win her. And I like her well enough to marry her, but I'm not committed to her in my heart as I have been with other girls. I'm not obsessed with her. I sort of just want to prove myself. I would be almost as happy to do some match making and send Jacob to go talk to Nexus. All he needs is someone to push him.

### Starting to like Ashlynn

2019-02-20

She is the shyest thing I've ever seen. She showed up while I was talking to the guys, and stood outside the crowd looking down. She's such a sweet girl when she talks to you, though. I actually like that she doesn't make eye contact because I'm sure that's the reason guys don't approach her. She really is extremely pretty, was home schooled for 4 years, and talks submissively, not domineeringly and loudly like many girls do to get attention. She is a Lutheran by descent, and I'll stay away from her if I can't get her saved.  
But she is the prettiest girl I know right now, even surpassing Amy because of her humility. Her skin is a natural light tan with no imperfections, her hair is brown and soft as wool, and her body is fit and beautiful, taking the silhouette of an hourglass without defect. She always wears these terrible jeans very high, too high, competing with the height of her belly button. They are a boring light blue color, and it turns me on because she has no apologies for it. She's not pinned down by the wiles of fashion. She's not of this world, and that causes me to take interest in her.  
There are some girls who need people to validate them, doing whatever it takes to please whoever they covet esteem from. There are other girls who need people who know that they don't care what you think. They need you to think that, and it's self-defeating. But it makes them loud and outgoing. But here is a girl who is not loud, and not a people-pleaser. She is a mystery to me. She doesn't dress herself in order to impress people, and she doesn't speak loudly in order to show people that she doesn't need their validation. Maybe she actually is content with such things as she has. Nevertheless, her shamefacedness is a virtue that is quick to win my affections.  
When I walked inside the college, there was a girl making eye contact with me, looking down for only a second, and looked back up at me, so I said, "It's raining out." She smiled and playfully said, "Really? Thank you for telling me. I just straightened my hair!" I didn't bother to get her number, but I would have said, "You're very pretty. Are you single?" It's much easier for me to show interest in a girl right away, because if I wait 5 weeks, then the girl will think, "He's been interested in me for 5 weeks and it's taken him 5 weeks to gain the courage to talk to me. He sat by me week 2 and then just kept talking to the guys. What a slow, shy, wimp."

### Dated Jennifer

2019-10-25 - 2019-12-13

Dear Jennifer,  

I'm really going to miss you. You're making the right choice in giving Joshua a chance to be a husband to you and a father to Emma. Emma needs her daddy to be there for her.  
Don't be afraid to lean on Joshua. He let you down once, and it can be hard to trust him after that. But it's clear to me that he loves you. The problem is that he doesn't know how.  
Don't let him take you to the bedroom until you both have exchanged vows to one another. I don't know how far along you are in your Christian walk, but if your idea is to become independent so that you can leave him in case he becomes unsupportive again, you don't trust him. No relationship can survive without trust. If you want love, you have to take risks. He burned you once. You have to be willing to be burned again. That's what giving him another chance means.  
Two things you need to consider. He needs to be the spiritual leader of your home. I'm not saying this to filter him out. I'm saying this because I want you to bring him to me so that I can show him Christ. God will change his heart. God will empower him to be a good husband to you-- someone you can trust. If you can't trust him, don't go back to him. You haven't married him. You aren't bound. He led you into making a bad decision. That does NOT make you obligated to marry him.  
Love worketh no I'll to his neighbor.  

My heart hurts because of how you love Joshua. My heart is bulldozed whenever I see him call your phone.  

I am your biggest supporter. I want you to succeed. But not for the wrong reasons. The best career you can have is being a wife and a mother.  

Joshua is young. His life could take 1 of 2 directions. Either he is going to seek the Lord and become the kind of man you want to be married to, or he will seek his own pleasure and be difficult to live with. Don't make believe there is a middle ground. If he does not love God, he will not be a good father. More important than anthing is making sure Emma has a godly example to follow so that she will learn to have a relationship with Jesus. Joshua needs to be that example. And he can be. But give him time.  

I want you to be happy. I care about you no matter what. Show him trust and show him Christ.  
You never knew it but your smile was the best part of working for Improving.  
You like a little bit of fire and spice. I can tell. Joshua can be rough at times, but at the end of the day you like it that way. You like that he can blow up sometimes. You like that he gets angry. I'm too patient for you. I'm too longsuffering. I'm too quick to forgive. I'm impossible to offend. Great peace have they which love thy law, and nothing shall offend them. I support you too unconditionally. You like it when Joshua tells you no. You disagreed with him and walked out because he made you angry, but you can't love someone that you can't be angry with. You can't love me because nothing I do or say will ever make you angry. I'm not enough of an adventure for you. I'm too easy. I'm too encouraging. I'm too sweet. I'm a nice guy. And when everything is over, you'll always choose Joshua. It's time for me to move on. We were never going to work anyway, but I'm going to miss you. I really liked seeing you every day. You made each work day bearable on my worst days and perfect on my best. I'm going to miss your smile. I'm going to miss your glances. I'm going to miss the way you walk into the room. But most of all I'm going to miss your chair scooted right next to mine. I'm going to miss you.  

I never told you this but the truth is that I love you. But I can see that you don't love me the same way. Don't worry about it. You were never obligated to.  

I never met anyone like you, and I don't expect to find another you. Your spirit was so gentle, so kind, so precious. I hope and pray that Joshua appreciates you, because you are one of a kind. There's no one like you. You are the best of them all.
