Whatever you do, don't complain about money to Mariana. Your job is to make her feel 0% involved in the finances. She has zero stress. Just like a parent to their kids, they take all the responsibility and shield that stress from the kids, I will do likewise with Mariana. I will not complain about money. If we can't afford things, we can't afford things. I will tell her no in the short term and find ways to make more money in the long term. No is sufficient. "Babe, I can't afford that." I don't need anything more. No complaints. Complaints are tools we use to elicit somebody's sympathy. No is sufficient. I don't need to complain.
