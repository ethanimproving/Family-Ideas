- [x] Drivers License [[2024-02-06|Address Change]]; do it [online](https://txapps.texas.gov/tolapp/txdl/?utm_source=texasgov&utm_medium=drivers_COA&utm_campaign=drivers_2019)
- [ ] Remove eye "RESTRICTIONS: A - with corrective lenses" on license.
	- [ ] Retake the [vision test](https://www.eyecenteroftexas.com/wp-content/uploads/Drivers_license_changes_after_LASIK_SX.pdf).
	- [x] [Schedule an appointment](https://public.txdpsscheduler.com/) at [Texas DPS](https://www.dps.texas.gov/section/driver-license/driver-license-services-appointments).

Given the urgency of the address change, it makes more sense to do that online and then remove the vision restriction separately.

The next available appointment is 5 months away.
