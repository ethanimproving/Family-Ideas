# To return your old Google Nest	
1. Print the attached **Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA)** return slip and **prepaid shipping label**. If you don't have a printer, you may want to ask a friend or family member to print this on your behalf. Public libraries often have computers and printers you can use as well.
2. Important: If the item has a serial number or IMEI, make sure that number matches the one in the attached RMA slip so that your RMA can be processed.
3. Reset your item to factory settings, and remove the SIM card if your item has one.
4. Pack your item (see below for guidance on accessories to include) and the RMA return slip either into the box your item came in or into a different box. Then attach the shipping label and mail it.
