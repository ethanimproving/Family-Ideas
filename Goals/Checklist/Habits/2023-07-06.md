According to the Disneyland Resort website, the State of California strongly recommends that all Guests complete their primary vaccination series or obtain a negative COVID-19 test prior to entering the Disneyland Resort [1](https://disneyland.disney.go.com/experience-updates/). However, ==Disneyland Resort is not requiring proof (of vaccination status or negative COVID-19 test result) at this time== [2](https://plandisney.disney.go.com/question/covid-test-required-enter-disneyland-california-parksif-463840/).

The amount paid for a wholly unused, expired ticket may be applied towards the purchase of a new ticket at the current price.

To enter a theme park, Guests (ages 3 and older) need both valid admission and a [theme park reservation](https://disneyland.disney.go.com/experience-updates/park-reservations/) for the same day and same park they want to visit.

With a Park Hopper ticket, you can enter the second theme park after 11:00 AM and go between the parks, subject to park capacity limitations.

The tickets were $1000 and the hotel was $1350. This time I'm going to be like Alex! It's only money. We're about to have an awesome time! Can't wait!
