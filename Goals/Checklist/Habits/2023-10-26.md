Every morning when I wake up, the stress I feel is mainly due to money. I realized no matter what, the Lord will take care of me, so I don't need to worry about money. So what if I don't have a lavish lifestyle? So what if I get a 9% interest rate on the home and have to spend $18,000 on a new roof? A few years ago I didn't have a job, and I didn't have a future. God gave me both of those, as well as a beautiful girlfriend with a kind and humble heart, and she doesn't need me to buy her expensive things. It's nice, it's attractive, and I want to do those things for her, but more important than the purity of a diamond is the purity of love, and we have the most important things without any of the fancy clothes or things that we want. I have a job now, and God blessed me with a good job. I will be fine no matter the result. My job is to confess and forsake my sin, and keep my way pure before the Lord. My job is to focus on getting the fornication out of my life, marrying Mariana, and a house will provide a more stable environment for her, so it's something I need to get regardless of the mortgage rate.  Now is the right time because of my life, not because of timing the market.
