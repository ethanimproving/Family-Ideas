I don't like the time pressure that I would be under to complete all of my projects in less than 6 months. I travel often, I work, I only have evenings and Saturdays to work on it, and the estimates I have on all these projects is pretty large. 

Hello,

I recently got an appraisal for my house, and the loan company I'm working with (nbkc Bank) has guidelines requiring all the floors to be installed. However, since I'm purchasing from my Uncle, I've started some renovations already, so I ripped up the carpet in the living room and 3 bedrooms, which now have bare concrete. I have a list of projects I intend to get done, the last of which should be the flooring so they don't get damaged. Since I am not wanting to put floors in before I close, they said I could put $4,500 into an Escrow account and complete the floor installation within 60 days, however this puts unrealistic time pressure on my other projects, so I'm wondering if your company has any such guidelines? Thanks

I am currently in the process of finalizing the purchase of my uncle's house through nbkc Bank. During the appraisal, it was noted that the loan guidelines require all floors to be installed before closing.

As part of my ongoing renovations in preparation for moving in, I have already removed the carpet from the living room and three bedrooms, leaving bare concrete. I have a comprehensive list of projects that I plan to complete, with flooring installation being the final step to prevent any potential damage.

I recently discussed the possibility of placing $4,500 into an Escrow account with nbkc Bank to allow me 60 days to complete the flooring installation after closing. While this is a viable option, it presents some challenges as it puts unrealistic time pressure on my other ongoing projects.

In light of this, I am reaching out to inquire if your company has any specific guidelines or alternative arrangements regarding the timing of flooring installations in similar property purchase scenarios. Your insights and assistance in navigating this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to your guidance.

Best regards,

Inquiry Regarding Flooring Installation Guidelines for Property Purchase

Hello Doug,

I got your contact information from Ann Weaver. I am currently in the process of finalizing the purchase of my uncle's house through nbkc Bank. During the appraisal, it was noted that their loan guidelines require all floors to be installed before closing.  

As part of my ongoing renovations in preparation for moving in, I have already removed the carpet from the living room and three bedrooms, leaving bare concrete. I have a list of projects that I plan to complete, with flooring installation being the final step to prevent any potential damage.  

I recently discussed the possibility of placing $4,500 into an Escrow account with nbkc Bank to allow me 60 days to complete the flooring installation after closing. While this is a viable option, it presents some challenges as it puts unrealistic time pressure on my other ongoing projects.  

In light of this, I am reaching out to inquire if your company has any specific guidelines regarding the absence of flooring during an appraisal. nbkc Bank mentioned it was a Fannie and Freddie guideline, however, upon reviewing both the [Fannie Mea Selling Guide](https://selling-guide.fanniemae.com/Selling-Guide/Origination-through-Closing/Subpart-B4-Underwriting-Property/Chapter-B4-1-Property-Assessment-and-Valuation/Section-B4-1-2-Documentation-Standards/1032991871/B4-1-2-05-Requirements-for-Verifying-Completion-and-Postponed-Improvements-03-01-2023.htm) and the [Freddie Mac Servicer Guide](https://guide.freddiemac.com/app/guide/section/5605.5) I couldn't locate any such guideline. I would appreciate hearing your insights on this matter.  

Thank you for your time, I look forward to your guidance.  

Best regards,

## Initial Draft

Hello Mike,

After running an estimation of all the projects I have lined up, I believe it will take considerable time before the floors are ready to go in. Keeping it less than 6 months is viable, but it does put uncomfortable time pressure on my other projects.

Upon reviewing both the [Fannie Mea Selling Guide](https://selling-guide.fanniemae.com/Selling-Guide/Origination-through-Closing/Subpart-B4-Underwriting-Property/Chapter-B4-1-Property-Assessment-and-Valuation/Section-B4-1-2-Documentation-Standards/1032991871/B4-1-2-05-Requirements-for-Verifying-Completion-and-Postponed-Improvements-03-01-2023.htm) and the [Freddie Mac Servicer Guide](https://guide.freddiemac.com/app/guide/section/5605.5) I couldn't locate any guideline that call out missing floors. In light of this I reached out to some local lenders and Gateway Bank said they could finance the home without the floor installation. My preference is to stick with nbkc Bank so I don't have to order another appraisal. I'm wondering if someone on the team was confused in their interpretation about this guideline, could we double check?

If not I will go with Gateway Bank, since I really don't want to deal with the Escrow timeline restrictions. Thanks

Hi Mike,

Upon evaluating the timeline for the various projects I have planned, it appears that it will take some time before the floors are ready for installation. While it is viable to complete the process in less than 6 months, it does impose considerable time pressure on my other ongoing projects.

After reviewing both the [Fannie Mae Selling Guide](https://selling-guide.fanniemae.com/Selling-Guide/Origination-through-Closing/Subpart-B4-Underwriting-Property/Chapter-B4-1-Property-Assessment-and-Valuation/Section-B4-1-2-Documentation-Standards/1032991871/B4-1-2-05-Requirements-for-Verifying-Completion-and-Postponed-Improvements-03-01-2023.htm) and the [Freddie Mac Servicer Guide](https://guide.freddiemac.com/app/guide/section/5605.5), I couldn't find any guidelines specifically requiring completed floors.

In light of this, I reached out to some local lenders, and Gateway Bank indicated that they could finance the home without the floor installation. However, my preference is to stick with nbkc Bank to avoid ordering another appraisal. I'm wondering if there might have been a misunderstanding or confusion regarding this guideline interpretation within the team. Could we please double-check to confirm?

If this isn't possible, I may proceed with Gateway Bank, as I'd like to avoid the Escrow timeline restrictions. Your clarification on this would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Best regards,

1. I want to do the project myself
2. I want at least 18 weeks to complete it.

Hi Mike,

After reviewing both the [Fannie Mae Selling Guide](https://selling-guide.fanniemae.com/Selling-Guide/Origination-through-Closing/Subpart-B4-Underwriting-Property/Chapter-B4-1-Property-Assessment-and-Valuation/Section-B4-1-2-Documentation-Standards/1032991871/B4-1-2-05-Requirements-for-Verifying-Completion-and-Postponed-Improvements-03-01-2023.htm) and the [Freddie Mac Servicer Guide](https://guide.freddiemac.com/app/guide/section/5605.5), I couldn't find any guidelines specifically requiring completed floors.

In light of this, I reached out to some local lenders, and Michele Creech from Cardinal Financial sent the appraisal to her underwriter who indicated that they could finance the home without the floor installation.

However, my preference is to stick with nbkc Bank to avoid the hassle of starting over. I'm wondering if there might have been a misunderstanding or confusion regarding this guideline interpretation within the team. Could we please double-check to confirm?

If this isn't possible, I may proceed with Cardinal Financial, as I'd like to avoid the Escrow timeline restrictions. Your clarification on this would be greatly appreciated.
