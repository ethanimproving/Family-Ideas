- It's been 64 days 
- The longest waiting estimate is December 19, 2024
- It is $23,000 on the line ($18,000 for roof, $5,000 for fence)
- How long will the home purchase take?

We could do that if necessary. I think it's been about 67 days out of 120, I was hoping we could get a yes or no from them, especially with the roofing company being optimistic about it. But it'll be December 16 by the end of 120 days, so if you want it closed by the end of the year I suppose that might not be realistic. Would you be willing to contact them one more time to get a clearer picture before we move forward?

I suppose that would be fine if necessary. 

While I'm willing to contact the insurance company if necessary, I would prefer to wait a little longer to see if they respond. This would be my preferred option, but I'm open to your input on how to proceed.

If you force me to I will, but I'd prefer to wait.

Can we wait 2 more weeks? They were

Can we contact them directly to get a clearer picture on the situation? Mediation 
Yep I 
Shoot. I was really hoping the mediation would come through.

Can we reach out to State Farm or the roofing company? I thought it was supposed to take 120 days max.

They havenâ€™t responded with a negative or positive response?

I suppose it's fine, I will ask if we can contact insurance one more time because they at least should tell us yes or no, not nothing at all, and if he doesn't want to I will go forward with the house

Seems like they should say something.

I was wondering if you'd be willing to contact them one more time? It would help us get a clearer picture of the situation.
