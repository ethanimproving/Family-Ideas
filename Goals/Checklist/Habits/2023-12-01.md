## Ready to sell the house

Hi Ann,

We are ready to move forward with selling the Oakmore house to Ethan for 210,000.  Ethan is Mom's grandson and the house is owned by the Carlson family trust just like Linklea was. 

Ethan has done some prequalifying and is fairly confident he can buy this house.  

We are selling it as is.  Since you have been in there the carpets have been torn out and they have done a few other things to get it ready for him.  

One question I have is should I go ahead and pay the tax on the house?  It is due before the end of the year but it is for next year and I don't know when we will be closing.  

Let us know what the next steps are.  

Thanks

Stu

Good morning,

Yes, I recommend going ahead and paying the property taxes.  I would pay them sooner rather than later just in case you do close this year the title co will not hold them until the county posts them as paid.

Ethan, What type of loan are you using and what amount are you putting down? Who is your lender?
  

Sincerely,

## Ethan is getting a mortage rate

Hello Ann,

My initial approval was a 30 year fixed at 7% with Rocket Mortgage, putting down $42,000 to avoid PMI. However, that was over 90 days ago so the approval already expired. I am contacting a couple of mortgage companies this morning to see which one will offer me the best rate.

Warm regards!

Ethan
