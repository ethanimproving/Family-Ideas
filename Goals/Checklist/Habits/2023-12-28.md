Hi Ethan,

I have attached the final draft of the Closing disclosure.  The funds needed to close will be $46,470.55.  Please reach out to Designated Title LLC for wiring instructions.  Tori Obregon will be the closer, Tori can be reached at 682-276-7200.  Your Closing date is 12/19, you will need to have your funds to close received by the title company before your closing.

There will be 2 different sessions to fully complete the closing.  On the closing date, you will need to complete the e-sign portion using the DocMagic link sent AND meet with the notary.  If both parts are not completed on the closing date, funding will be delayed.

1. **E-sign portion using the DocMagic link:** This is likely a digital or electronic signing process that you will need to complete online.
    
2. **Meeting with the notary:** This refers to a physical meeting with a notary public. Notaries are authorized individuals who can verify the authenticity of signatures on legal documents. In the context of your closing, meeting with the notary likely involves signing certain documents in person, and this step is crucial for the completion of the closing process.
