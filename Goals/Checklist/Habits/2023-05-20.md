- [x] Respond to Suhail about the Red Hot Preaching Conference
- [x] Learn Flutter

My state of mind is that it will be more effective to learn by observing the finished projects of other developers in a running state rather than a 35 hour Udemy course. I am spending today hunting for repos that contain components I can extract into my vision for the Unbound Preaching app.

If I can ==learn how to run every other app that has been developed==, it will be much easier to piece together a structured finished product. Today I am learning Flutter. Because it also supports Web applications as well as Android and IOS, I am more inclined to use it as opposed to React Native. However, because Pastor Shelley's [GodResources](https://new.godresource.com/video) app is written in React, as well as the David's door2door app, American Airlines, and many other companies, it would be more practical for me to learn react.

For now, I will focus entirely on the React web page, and then add another repository in React Native or Flutter. If the Webpage keeps the user logged in, and automatically flips to video (like PopcornHub), it will be sufficient for getting all the functionality identified and written.
