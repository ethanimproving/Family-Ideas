Caleb and I visited so many cars today. Thursday was a Blue 2017 Toyota Corolla XLE with 120,754 miles for 10,000 from an African man named Fuad. The car had a strong water damage smell though, and had a clear water leak in the spare tire compartment in the back when it rains.

After 6 cars and 7 appointments, Caleb and I finally settled for one.
