Buffalo construction has informed me that the mediation would take from 30-120 days because the insurance companies are really busy right now.

If we go to mediation we are agreeing to have him do the roof if insurance pays for it and he believes they will.
Stuart

If they can not get insurance to pay for it we are not obligated to have him do the roof.

This company does not charge for the mediation so no fees if they do or do not get the insurance company to pay.

The deductible is 2% of the home's value so likely to be about $4,000. Getting a quote from Paul on doing it with out insurance is a good idea. The 30-120 days to get the roof on so we can sell it to you is a bit of a pain.
