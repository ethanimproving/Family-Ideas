I want to surround myself with people that have vision. People that strive to obtain a life better than the one they have. I want to be around people who *want* to live in a nice house, not people who are content with living in the ghetto. People who are content as a slave will stay a slave. I want to be around people who reach for freedom, who are motivated to fight for a better world. Asphalt roads, graffiti, patches in roads, cracks, hills, pot holes, dirty walls, and all such like things are an abomination to me.
