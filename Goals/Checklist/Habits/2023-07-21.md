# July 21st accomplishments

Here are the items that A/B/C/T did today at the Oakmore house. See attachment with the outlet mapping.

1) Validated all circuits  
                #13 has neutral/hot wire issues in bedroom1 (corner), TBD how to fix, but will involve **tracing wires in the attic space**.

We should rename all the circuit numbers correctly per common practice standards.

2) Remove air handler vent and clean underneath it  
                90% completed, will need to reinstall the vents, Caleb could not get 100% underneath it, maybe Ethan can finish it?
	
3) Finish installing outlets  
                Installed (4) outlets in master bedroom, still have the living room to do, and both bathrooms
	
4) Brian checkout floors, ready for vinyl?  
                Brian can report on this one
	
5) Fix outlet under kitchen sink  
                Circuit #18, dedicated, also reset the disposal since it was stuck, but it is old and will need to be replaced
	
6) Fix garage light outlet  
                Brian replace the porcelain light fixture on the ceiling, but probably want one with a pull string on it. This switch also turns on the light outside of the garage.
	
7) Take pictures of attic space  
                Caleb did this
	
8) Dust fans  
                Complete, the kitchen and living room were VERY dusty, bedrooms 1 and 2 just a little
	
9) Pressure wash
	Anna completed the pressure washing of the front sidewalk and the road
