# Critical Path

Find a **critical path**. Electrical needs to be done before finishing up the drywall. Closing needs to be done before any structural renovations.

## Task Breakdowns

In a critical path analysis, tasks can be classified into different types based on their relationships and dependencies within the project. Here are some key terms associated with different types of tasks:

1. **Start-to-Finish (SF):** The dependent task cannot finish until the predecessor task has started.
    
2. **Finish-to-Start (FS):** The dependent task cannot start until the predecessor task has finished.
    
3. **Start-to-Start (SS):** The dependent task can start at the same time as the predecessor task.
    
4. **Finish-to-Finish (FF):** The dependent task can finish at the same time as the predecessor task.
    
5. **Concurrent Tasks:** Tasks that can be performed simultaneously without any dependency on each other.
    
6. **Dependent Tasks:** Tasks that rely on the completion of other tasks.
    
7. **Critical Tasks:** Tasks that are on the critical path and directly impact the project's overall duration.
    
8. **Non-Critical Tasks:** Tasks that, if delayed, would not impact the project's overall duration.
    

Understanding these task relationships is crucial for project managers to effectively schedule and manage the project timeline. The critical path typically consists of tasks with dependencies that, if delayed, would extend the project's completion time.
