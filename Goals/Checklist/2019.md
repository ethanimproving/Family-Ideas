**Lecture 7**

- **Lecture Notes.**
- [X] Anytime you have a CREATE, in general we drop it first, and we always have a GO before it and after it.
- [X] Professors convention is to put the parent on the left and the child on the right.

```
-- only childless parents
SELECT p.p_id AS PrimaryKey,
              c.p_id AS ForeignKey,  c_id
==FROM parent AS p LEFT OUTER JOIN child AS c==
       ON p.p_id = c.p_id
WHERE c.p_id IS NULL
ORDER BY p.p_id, c_id;
```

What is the order of execution?
1. FROM
2. WHERE
3. SELECT
4. ORDER BY

The 2 hours completion time is more lenient than 5PM Tuesday Due Date.

- **Change color theme of SSMS.**

Method 1:

- [X] Review Color themes already available

`Tools > Options > Environment > General > Color theme:`

- [X] Close SSMS if it is running.
- [X] Open the configuration file (ssms.pkgundef)

`C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SQL Server\140\Tools\Binn\ManagementStudio`

(You may need to open your text editor as an administrator to edit the SSMS configuration file)

- [X] Search for the Remove Dark Theme heading and comment out the first line

```
// Remove Dark theme
//[$RootKey$\Themes\{1ded0138-47ce-435e-84ef-9ec1f439b749}]
[$RootKey$\AD7Metrics\PortSupplier\{4103F338-2255-40C0-ACF5-7380E2BEA13D}]

[$RootKey$\Text Editor\Memory]
[$RootKey$\Text Editor\Register]
[$RootKey$\Text Editor\ResJSON]
[$RootKey$\Text Editor\TypeScript]
[$RootKey$\Text Editor\VBScript]
```

Method 2:

- [X] Open PowerShell as Administrator

`powershell -Command "(gc 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SQL Server\140\Tools\Binn\ManagementStudio\ssms.pkgundef') -replace '\[\``$RootKey\``$\\Themes\\{1ded0138-47ce-435e-84ef-9ec1f439b749}\]', '//[``$RootKey``$\Themes\{1ded0138-47ce-435e-84ef-9ec1f439b749}]' | Out-File 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SQL Server\140\Tools\Binn\ManagementStudio\ssms.pkgundef'"`

- [X] Set object explorer to dark theme

```
Tools > Options > Environment > Fonts and Colours > Grid Resutls
Set Background to Black and foreground to white.
```

Method 3:

- [X] Use Visual Studio Community Instead

```
View > SQL Server Object Explorer
Add SQL Server > FX-4100\SQLEXPRESS > emiller25 > {standard}
```

- [ ] Modify keyboard shortcuts

`Tools > Options > Environment > Keyboard`

**Module 6 Assignment B**

- **Instructions.**
- [X] Instructions: Using your favorite text editor (probably NotePad++), create the file: mod6b_assign1.sql
- [X] Place a heading at the beginning of the file that looks something like this:

```
/*
Module Six, Chapter Four exercises Part B
Ethan Miller
ITSE 2309
*/
```

Use your own name, of course, and you have license to change format as you believe looks professional so long as the document clearly states what it is and who wrote it.

- [X] Number each exercise in a comment and skip space between them.
- [X] End each statement with a semicolon (';')
- [X] When you finish, the entire file should run as an SQL script.  The easier it is to read, the better grade it will receive.

- [X] Do not default the term "OUTER".

- [X] 1) Write an SQL SELECT statement that returns two columns from the glAccounts table: accountNo and accountDescription.  The result set should have one row for each account number *that has never been used*.
- [X] Sort the output by accountNo.

(an accountNo has "been used" if it appears in the **invoiceLineItems** table)

```
SELECT  g.accountNo AS accountNo,
        accountDescription AS accountDescription
FROM glAccounts AS g LEFT OUTER JOIN invoiceLineItems AS i
  ON g.accountNo = i.accountNo
WHERE i.accountNo IS NULL
ORDER BY accountNo ASC;
```

- Since glAccounts is the parent table, the exercise becomes: find childless parents; therefore, it's an OUTER JOIN.  ( I see 54 rows in mine.)

- [X] 2) Write an SQL query that will
- - [X] return all of the invoiceID values from the invoices table
- - [X] that do not also appear in the invoiceLineItems table. (one row)

```
SELECT i.invoiceID AS invoiceID
FROM invoices AS i LEFT OUTER JOIN invoiceLineItems AS l
  ON i.invoiceID = l.invoiceID
WHERE l.invoiceID IS NULL
ORDER BY invoiceID;
```

- [X] 3) We are trying to enable the FOREIGN KEY constraint in the invoiceLineItems table; however, we have data in the child table that are  *inconsistent with the similarly named field in the invoices table*.  Return all data on the row or rows.  (Hint: SELECT tableName.*  ... one row returned)

```
SELECT i.invoiceID AS PrimaryKey,
              l.invoiceID AS ForeignKey
FROM invoices AS i RIGHT OUTER JOIN invoiceLineItems AS l
       ON i.invoiceID = l.invoiceID
WHERE i.invoiceID IS NULL AND l.invoiceID IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY PrimaryKey;
```

- [X] 4) While we're at it, let's check the contactUpdates table for bogus data.  The odd thing about that table is that somebody set up the FOREIGN KEY referencing the vendors table in contactUpdates as also being the PRIMARY KEY!  Write an SQL query that will
- - [X] find any vendorID in contactUpdates
- - [X] that does not appear in the vendors; return all data.  (There is one.)

```
SELECT v.vendorID AS PrimaryKey,
              c.vendorID AS ForeignKey
FROM vendors AS v RIGHT OUTER JOIN contactUpdates AS c
       ON v.vendorID = c.vendorID
WHERE v.vendorID IS NULL AND c.vendorID IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY PrimaryKey;
```

- [X] 5) List the vendorID and vendorName for all vendors who have no corresponding rows in the invoices table.  (I see 88 of them.)

```
SELECT v.vendorID AS PrimaryKey,
              vendorName AS vendorName,
              i.vendorID AS ForeignKey
FROM vendors AS v LEFT OUTER JOIN invoices AS i
       ON v.vendorID = i.vendorID
WHERE i.vendorID IS NULL
ORDER BY PrimaryKey;
```

**ITSE 2309, Practice Test One**

- **Instructions.**
- [X] Please note the time you begin and end the assignment because I would like to know this information.
- [X] Instructions: Using your favorite text editor (probably NotePad++), create the file: PracticeTest1.sql
- [X] Place a heading at the beginning of the file that looks something like this:

```
/*

Test 1
Ethan Miller
ITSE 2309

*/
```

- [X] Number each exercise clearly in a comment and skip space between them.
- [X] End each statement with a semicolon (';')
- [X] When you finish, the entire file should run as an SQL script.  The easier it is to read, the better grade it will receive.

- [X] Unless the exercise specifically calls for an implicit join, use an explicit INNER JOIN for all exercises in this block.
- [X] Do not default the terms "INNER" or "OUTER" as seen in the textbook.  A query might not produce any output and still be correct.

*******************************************************************

- **Part One: (For part one, you will use your default database; don't create a new one.) (20 points)****.**

Write the SQL code to create *at least* two tables;  however, you might need more tables to accomplish the specific task.  Your tables will keep track of:

- [X] Create a table names Owners; the properties of an owner are:
- - [X] Owner ID…
- - [X] First Name…
- - [X] Last Name…
- - [X] Address…
- - [X] Phone

```
GO
CREATE TABLE owners
(
       o_id          CHAR(4),
       o_fname              VARCHAR(16),
       o_lname              VARCHAR(16),
       o_street      VARCHAR(34),
       o_city        VARCHAR(22),
       o_state              CHAR(2),
       o_zip         CHAR(5),
       o_phone_num   CHAR(10),
       --
       CONSTRAINT ownerPK PRIMARY KEY(o_id),
       CONSTRAINT owner_null_oname CHECK(o_fname IS NOT NULL),
       CONSTRAINT owner_null_oname CHECK(o_lname IS NOT NULL),
);
----------------------------------------------------------
GO
```

- [X] If you have already created the tables with the same names as the assignment, you will need to drop them before you can recreate them.  This is a *very* commonly-used schema!

```
-- Drop existing tables
IF OBJECT_ID('pets') IS NOT NULL
       DROP TABLE pets;
IF OBJECT_ID('vehicles') IS NOT NULL
       DROP TABLE vehicles;
IF OBJECT_ID('owners') IS NOT NULL
       DROP TABLE owners;
```

- [X] Select tables where owner is being referenced and drop them

```
SELECT *
FROM sys.foreign_keys
WHERE referenced_object_id = object_id('owners')

SELECT
    'ALTER TABLE [' +  OBJECT_SCHEMA_NAME(parent_object_id) +
    '].[' + OBJECT_NAME(parent_object_id) +
    '] DROP CONSTRAINT [' + name + ']'
FROM sys.foreign_keys
WHERE referenced_object_id = object_id('owners')
```

- [X] Vehicles; the properties of a vehicle are:
- - [X] Vehicle ID
- - [X] Make
- - [X] Model
- - [X] Year
- - [X] Color

```
GO
CREATE TABLE vehicles
(
       VehicleID     CHAR(8),
       v_Make               VARCHAR(16),
       v_Model       VARCHAR(16),
       v_Year               CHAR(4),
       v_Color              CHAR(2),
       OwnerID              CHAR(8),
       CONSTRAINT v_PK PRIMARY KEY(VehicleID),
       CONSTRAINT v_FK FOREIGN KEY(OwnerID) REFERENCES owners(OwnerID)
);

GO  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```

- [X]  Cause the following relationship to exist: An owner has many cars; a car may have *at most one owner* (no common-property here -- one to many relationship).        (This is a one to many)
- - [X] Write the code to insert at least three records into each table.
- - [X] Use proper SQL programming style for table creation (e.g.: name all of your constraints and use semicolons.)
- - [X] Choose meaningful identifiers and reasonable data types. For example: a last name might allow 16 characters... perhaps; 50 is too many and two characters is too few.
- - [X] Constrain all last names against NULL.

```

INSERT INTO owners(OwnerID, o_FirstName, o_LastName, o_Street, o_City, o_State,  o_Zip, o_Phone)

VALUES ('0001', 'Marty', 'Stec', 'Arch Street', '15701', 'Indiana', 'PA',  '6606880679'),

              ('0002', 'Penni', 'Jimison', 'Green Street', '33056', 'Miami  Gardens', 'FL', '9789722191'),

              ('0003', 'Wilfred', 'Sanches', 'Parker Street', '19701', 'Bear',  'DE', '5057936710');

INSERT INTO vehicles(VehicleID, v_Make, v_Model, v_Year, v_Color, OwnerID)
VALUES ('9876', 'Ford', 'Tarus', '2009', 'BK', '2345'),
              ('9876', 'Ford', 'Tarus', '2009', 'BK', '2345'),
              ('9876', 'Ford', 'Tarus', '2009', 'BK', '2345');
```

************************************************************

[Use ap_DB; scratch_DB is default]

**Part 2** (For part two, use your default database and the existing Vendors-Invoices-Terms schema.)

- [X] 1) Insert the following record into the Terms table:

`<TermsID>`      `<TermsDescription>`   `<TermsDueDays>`
     6                      Existing Credit             -1

```
INSERT INTO terms(TermsID, TermsDescription, TermsDueDays)
VALUES(6, 'Existing Credit', -1);
```

- [X] Drop the value first, if it exists

```
DELETE FROM terms
WHERE TermsID = 6;
```

- [X] 2) Change the CreditTotal to 50.00 for all of the invoices for VendorID 122.

```
UPDATE invoices
SET creditTotal = 50
WHERE vendorID = 122;
```

- [X] 3) Update the Vendors table to to show (999) 999-9999 for the phones that are currently NULL.

```
UPDATE vendors
SET vendorPhone = '9999999999'
WHERE vendorPhone IS NULL;
```

- [X] 4) Write an SQL SELECT query to show the name and city for Vendors in zip 53707 whose city begins with 'Ma'; sort the output by city.

```
SELECT vendorName AS vendorName,
              vendorCity AS vendorCity
FROM vendors
WHERE vendorZipCode = '53707' AND vendorCity LIKE 'Ma%'
ORDER BY vendorCity;
```

- [X] 5) Write the SQL code to delete VendorID = 113 from the Vendor's table; also delete any associated invoices.  This will probably require two SQL statements in the correct order.

```
DELETE FROM invoices
WHERE vendorID = 113;
DELETE FROM vendors
WHERE vendorID = 113;
```

- [X] 6) Write an SQL SELECT query that shows the invoiceNumber and invoiceDueDate for Vendors in California ("CA").

```
SELECT invoiceNumber, invoiceDueDate
FROM invoices AS i INNER JOIN vendors AS v ON i.vendorID = v.vendorID
WHERE vendorState = 'CA';
```

- [X] 7) Write an SQL join that will find any unused "Terms" in the table; i.e., no invoice has these terms.

```
SELECT i.termsID
FROM invoices AS i RIGHT JOIN terms AS t
       ON i.termsID = t.termsID
WHERE t.termsID IS NULL;
```

- [X] 8) Write an SQL query that will return the vendorCity, invoiceNumber, and invoiceTotal for all rows with an invoice less than 100 and a termsDueDays less than or equal to 20.

```
SELECT vendorCity AS vendorCity,
              invoiceNumber AS invoiceNumber,
              invoiceTotal AS invoiceTotal
FROM
       vendors AS v
              JOIN
       invoices AS i
              ON v.vendorID = i.vendorID
              JOIN
       terms AS t
              ON i.termsID = t.termsID
WHERE invoiceTotal < 100 AND termsDueDays <= 20
ORDER BY invoiceTotal;
```

- [X] 9) You may have noticed that the defaultTermsID field of the vendors table is not constrained as a foreign key.  If we tried to add a foreign key constraint, it would fail because there are invalid data in the table... because I placed them there.  Write an SQL query that will find all invalid data in that field.  (Read your schema!  The table and field names give you information about which tables are being referenced.)

```
SELECT vendorID AS vendorID,
              defaultTermsID AS defaultTermsID
FROM vendors LEFT JOIN terms
  ON defaultTermsID = termsID
WHERE termsID IS NULL;
```

# Thursday, Feb 28th -- C++ Assignment 5
Created

Thursday, Feb 28, 2019, 2:42 PM

Your goal is to ask the user for the speed of a vehicle (in miles per hour) and how many hours it has

traveled. The program should then use a loop to display the distance the vehicle has traveled for each

hour of that time period.

Your program should have the following:

- [X] The name of the program should be Assignment5.
- [X] 3 comment lines (description of the program, author, and date).
- [X] Ask the user for the speed of a vehicle (in miles per hour). Store this result in a variable with an appropriate name.
- [X] Do not accept a negative number for the speed. Use a loop to stop this from happening. (3 points)
- [X] Ask the user for the number of hours that the vehicle has traveled. Store this result in a variable with an appropriate name.
- [X] Do not accept a value less than 1 for the time traveled. Use a loop to stop this from happening. (3 points)
- [X] Use a loop to display the distance the vehicle has traveled for each hour of that time period (based on the speed and hours that the vehicle has been traveling). (4 points)

Example:

What is the speed of the vehicle in mph? 40
How many hours has it traveled? 3
Hour       Distance Traveled

[Homework 4](file:///A:/Users/Ethan/OneDrive%20for%20Business/Documents/Academic%20Documents/Spring%202019/ITSE%201359%20(Python)/Week%205/HW4-1.pdf)**: **Using Functions to Simplify Programs ([Chapter 7](file:///A:/Users/Ethan/OneDrive%20for%20Business/Documents/Academic%20Documents/Spring%202019/ITSE%201359%20(Python)/Begin-to-Code-with-Python.pdf))

- **Exercise 1.**
- [X]  Create a function called ‘get_type’ that:

1. - [X] Accepts one argument

2. - [X] Checks if that argument is an integer, a float, or a string using the isinstance function.

3. - [X] Returns the result as either ‘integer’, ‘float’, or ‘string’.
4. - [X] If it is not one of the three type, return an empty string ‘’.

5. - [X] Add code to test your function. Print your result to the interpreter window and take a screenshot for submission.

The required object types for comparison in this exercise are: int for integer, float for floating point, and str for string.

```

# Ethan Miller

# ITSE 1359

# Homework 4 Exercise 1

# Name of excersize

def get_type(data):
  # define datatypes.
  types = (int, float, str)
  type_names = ('integer', 'float', 'string')

  for type in types:

    # check if first letter of datatype is a vowel
    vowel = ['a','e','i','o','u']
    if type_names[types.index(type)][0].lower() in vowel:
      determiner = 'an'
    else:
      determiner = 'a'

    # if
    if isinstance(data,type)==True:
      print(f'You have input {determiner} {type_names[types.index(type)]}')

  get_type(data)
except NameError:
  print('You have input a string')
except:
  print("")
```

- **Extra Credit**
- [X] Create a function called ‘get_tuple_value_types’ that

1. - [X] Accepts one tuple as an argument.
2. - [X] Determines the type of each value in the tuple.

3. - [X] Returns a tuple containing the type of each value of the argument tuple as a string, i.e., ‘integer’, ‘float’, or ‘string’.

4. - [X] If a value is not one of the three types, return an empty string '' in the tuple.

5. - [X] Add code to test your function using the tuple, (‘a’,4,6.4,(1,2,3)).

- [X] Print your result to the interpreter window and take a screenshot for submission.

```

# Ethan Miller

# Homework 4 Exercise 1

# Get function value types

def get_tuple_value_types(*data):

  # define datatypes.
  types = (int, float, str)
  type_names = ('integer', 'float', 'string')

  # create empty list to hold data for new tuple

# example data

data = ('a', 4, 6.4, (1,2,3))

# display the tuple datatypes from example data

print(get_tuple_value_types(*data))
```

- **Exercise 2.**
- [X] Create a function called ‘print_characters that

1. - [X] Accepts one argument. The argument should be a tuple of integers.

2. - [X] Convert each value to a Unicode character using the chr() function (Look it up in the Python documentation.) and print each Unicode character to the interpreter window.

3. - [X] Add error handling to check if each value is valid Unicode. The chr() documentation contains the valid range and the appropriate exception to handle. If the value isn’t valid, skip that value.

4. - [X] Add code to test your function using the argument (945,946,947,948).

- [X] Print your result to the interpreter window and take a screenshot for submission.

```

# Ethan Miller

# ITSE 1359

# Homework 4 Exercise 2

# Get number of characters

def print_characters(integers):
  'Prints the Unicode characters that correspond to given integers passed in'
  for integer in integers:
    try:
      print(chr(integer))
    except ValueError:
      continue

# example integers

integers = (945,946,947,948)

# print the Unicode characters that correspond to the given integers

print_characters(integers)
```

- **Exercise 3.**

1. - [X]  Create a file called chp7_functions.py. Add the example functions in EG7-02, EG7-03, EG7-04, EG7- 06, and EG07-10 to the file. Don’t copy extra code, just the functions.

2. - [X] Create an application file example_3.py and
    1. - [X] Import the chp7_functions module.

    2. - [X] Invoke the EG7-02 function in your example_3.py application with an argument value of 5. Take a screenshot of the result in the interpreter. [Is it supposed that we're supposed to rename the functions?]

    3. - [X] Create a function in your example_3.py application called run_eg7_10.

    4. - [X] Invoke your new function in example_3.py with the statement print(‘You have selected ride: ‘, run_eg7_10()) modified to use the following arguments: [Why are we creating a new function that only runs another function and returns its value? Why not just use the chp7_functions.get_value() function and leave it at that?]

        1. - [X] prompt = ‘Please enter the ride number you want: ‘
        2. - [X] value_min = 1
        3. - [X] value_max = 5
    5. - [X] Enter 4 and take a screenshot of the result in the interpreter.

```

- **Exercise 4.**

1.  - [X] Start you virtual environment and run IDLE.

2. - [X] Import chp7_functions module from exercise 3 at the IDLE shell interpreter command prompt. [Open the py file and run it first, to restart the IDLE in the right directory]

3. - [X] Open the chp7_functions module in the editor and set a break point on line 11, print(‘Value too large’).

4. - [X] Turn the debugger on from the shell menu.

5. - [X] At the interpreter command prompt enter, ‘chp7_functions.get_value("Enter a ride number: ", 1, 5)

6. - [X] When the debugger activates, press the Go button.
7. - [X] Enter 10 at the application prompt.

8. - [X] Take a snapshot of the Debug Control window when the application stops at the break point.

- **Homework Submission.**

1.  - [X] A zip file containing the .py files and snapshot for exercises 1- 3 and the snapshot from exercise 4

- **Discussion Post.**

It looks to me like you understand it correctly. If you review the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=chr#chr) for the chr() function, it's based on Unicode, not ASCII. Presumable reasons are covered on page 83 of our textbook:

"ASCII is a perfectly fine standard if you don’t want to print more than 100 or so different characters. However, because many modern languages use more than 100 characters, UNICODE has become the new standard. UNICODE allows for many more characters, emojis, and emoticons."

Nice catch on EG7-06. I copied it over without even notice it was the same. I doubt Prof will take off points for leaving it out, since we only use the functions from EG7-02 and EG7-10, and we followed instructions in dealing with the sample files. But if you want to be a little more conscientious, you can [copy the code](https://pastebin.com/NbCH5cYQ) from page 181 of the textbook (under the heading "Default parameter values," since you have an eBook).

If you notice in exercise 4, Prof says line 11 is print(‘Value too large’), and that only makes sense if the get_value() function is the only function in the py file.

#sql 

Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof. [Smith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46MRaTw3SmA&t=45m7s&list=PLYAz1Lwo4O587rxMb1sTe8oXLDvrbkCo6&index=9)

See [relationships](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46MRaTw3SmA&t=1h&list=PLYAz1Lwo4O587rxMb1sTe8oXLDvrbkCo6&index=9) between keys.

- [X] Using your favorite text editor (probably NotePad++), create the file: mod6_assign1.sql
- [X] Place a heading at the beginning of the file that looks something like this:

```
/*
Module Six, Chapter Four exercises
Ethan Miller
ITSE 2309
*/
```

- [X] Unless the exercise specifically calls for an implicit join (old syntax, see #3), use an ==explicit INNER JOIN== for all exercises in this block... and do not default the term "INNER".
- [X] 1) Without looking back at the exercise in the module (you have done this one), write an SQL SELECT statement ==using the ==explicit join syntax==== (pg 127) that will return the vendorName and each associated invoiceNumber.  We will order by vendorName, then invoiceNumber.  (You should have 114 rows in the output.)

```
SELECT  v.vendorName AS vendorName,
        i.invoiceNumber AS invoiceNumber
FROM vendors AS v INNER JOIN invoices AS i
  ON v.vendorID = i.vendorID
ORDER BY v.vendorName ASC, i.invoiceNumber ASC;
```

- [X] 2) Write an SQL SELECT statement using the explicit join syntax that will return four columns named as shown:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| *vendorName* | From the *vendors* table |
| *invoiceNumber* | From the *invoices* table |
| *invoiceDate* | From the *invoices* table |
| *balanceDue* | Derived from *invoiceTotal* minus the sum of the *paymentTotal* and *creditTotal*fields (get used to this calculation!) |

- [X] The result set will show one row for each invoive with a non-zero balanceDue.
- [X] Sort the result set by vendorName in ascending order.  (I have 12 rows in my output.)

```
SELECT  v.vendorName AS vendorName,
        i.invoiceNumber AS invoiceNumber,
        i.invoiceDate AS invoiceDate,
        i.invoiceTotal - (i.paymentTotal + i.creditTotal) AS balanceDue
FROM vendors AS v INNER JOIN invoices AS i
  ON v.vendorID = i.vendorID
WHERE i.invoiceTotal - (i.paymentTotal + i.creditTotal) > 0
ORDER BY v.vendorName ASC;
```

- [X] 3) Generate the same result as #2, however, using the implicit join syntax described on page 139 of the text.

```
SELECT  v.vendorName AS vendorName,
        i.invoiceNumber AS invoiceNumber,
        i.invoiceDate AS invoiceDate,
        i.invoiceTotal - (i.paymentTotal + i.creditTotal) AS balanceDue
FROM vendors AS v, invoices AS i
WHERE v.vendorID = i.vendorID AND
      i.invoiceTotal - (i.paymentTotal + i.creditTotal) > 0
ORDER BY v.vendorName ASC;
```

Up until now, we have used only the vendors (parent) table and the invoices (child) table.  For #4, you need to know that ==the==  ==defaultAccountNo==  ==of the vendors table references the==  ==accountNo==  ==of the glAccounts table==.  Thus, the glAccounts table is the parent and vendors is the child in this relationship.  [Here](https://collin.instructure.com/courses/836867/files/57197196/preview?verifier=uztac9jiH0N9akRXyqlva8OkYbUN1Seol5TmNl36) is an example where the foreign key has a different name than its parent.  Avoid this when possible.

- [X] 4) Write an SQL SELECT statement using the explicit join syntax that will return three columns named as shown:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| vendorName | from the vendors table |
| defaultAccountNo | from the vendors table |
| accountDescription | from the glAccounts table |

- [X] The result should be one row for each vendor with the defaultAccountNo and accountDescription for each of them.
- [X] Sort the result by accountDescription, then by vendorName.  (I get 122 rows.)

```
SELECT  v.vendorName AS vendorName,
        v.defaultAccountNo AS defaultAccountNo,
        g.accountDescription AS invoiceDate
FROM vendors AS v INNER JOIN glAccounts AS g
  ON v.defaultAccountNo = g.accountNo
ORDER BY g.accountDescription ASC, v.vendorName ASC;
```

To complete #5, you must know that ==the invoiceID of the invoiceLineItems (child) table references the invoiceID of the invoices (parent) table. == Also, if you examine the invoiceLineItems table carefully, you will notice that it has a two-field primary key.  This is not generally desirable; however, sometimes it has to be designed thus.  (The latter condition does not impact the join at all.)

- [X] 5) Write an SQL SELECT statement using the explicit join syntax that will return five columns named as shown from three tables:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| *vendor* | *vendorName* from the *vendors* table |
| *iDate* | *invoiceDate* from the *invoices* table |
| *iNumber* | *invoiceNumber* from the *invoices* table |
| *seqNum* | *invoiceSequence* from the *invoiceLineItems* table |
| *lineAmt* | *invoiceLineItemAmount* from the *invoiceLineItems* table |

- [X] Sort the result by vendor, iDate, iNumber, and seqNum.  (Returns 118 rows)

```
SELECT  v.vendorName AS vendor,
        i.invoiceDate AS iDate,
        i.invoiceNumber AS iNumber,
        l.invoiceSequence AS seqNum,
        l.invoiceLineItemAmount AS lineAmt
FROM
    vendors AS v
      INNER JOIN
    invoices AS i
      ON v.vendorID = i.vendorID
      INNER JOIN
    invoiceLineItems AS l
      ON l.invoiceID = i.invoiceID
ORDER BY iDate ASC, iNumber ASC, seqNum ASC;
```

- [X] Remove table prefixes from every column that doesn't need it (i.invoiceDate can just be invoiceDate if there are no other tables that have a column with that name)

After user_selection() failed to assign a value to ride_number, ==it continued on to the while loop that was testing for ride_number==. To overcome this, you can either initialize the ride_number variable to 0 so that it's defined, or you can loop the user_selection function by adding it to the except results.

Alternatively, you could wrap it in a while loop that tests whether a boolean is false, and continue until it's the number is a valid integer.

- **Exercise 2.**
- [X]  Add error handling to the application you developed for exercise 1. (If you had difficulty with exercise 1, add error handling to EG5-13.)

1. - [X] Trap the entry of an invalid number. (See EG6-03 example.)
2. - [X] Trap the `<Ctrl>+<C>` using KeyboardInterrupt exception. (p156)

- In Excercise 2, ignore the 'Modify EG5-13 and remember to convert the command prompt statement to snaps command for input/output (i/o)' at the end. It's a copy error from Excercise 1. I will remove the line from the homework assignment.

- **Exercise 3.**
- [X] Add error handling to [my solution](https://collin.instructure.com/courses/838618/files/57581975/download?wrap=1) to exercise 4 in homework 2. (Download my solution from the [Homework Solutions](https://collin.instructure.com/courses/838618/pages/homework-answers) page.)
- [X] 1. Trap all exceptions using the following code:

```
except Exception as e:
    print( "Error: “ + str(e) )
```

An error occurs when selecting category 4 in my example solution.

- [X] Run your application and select category 4.
- [X] Examine the error in the IDLE Shell interpreter window.
- [X] Take a snapshot of the Shell window for submission.

- [X] Post Discussion:

Is anyone able to catch the "Text too large" exception for homework 3 exercise 3? Snaps raises an exception on line 175 if the text height is greater than the window height of 600 pixels, but

except Exception as e:
    print('Error: ' + str(e))

isn't trapping it. Instead, I'm getting the normal traceback and snaps itself is printing, "Exception: Text too large for window" and closes the program. I'm not sure what's going wrong.

However, I'm still getting a traceback.

Is anyone able to get the "Text too large" exception for exercise 3? Snaps raises an exception on line 175 if the text height is greater than the window height of 600 pixels, but the exception makes the program stop before print('Error: ' + str(e)) has the chance to print "Error: Text too large for window." Instead, snaps itself is printing, "Exception: Text too large for window" and closes the program.

If I remove the exception from snaps, no problem is detected at all, and the text just prints outside the window. So we need snaps to raise the exception, but if snaps raises the exception, our program stops before we have the chance to catch the exception. I don't know how to get out of this paradox.

but the exception makes the program stop before print('Error: ' + str(e)) has the chance to print "Error: Text too large for window."

From what I understand, "except Exception as e:" should be dealing with any raised exceptions the way isn't catching the exception.

 I think it's already programmed into snaps.

```
if height > window_size[1]:
    raise Exception('Text too large for window')
```

Oh, I was a goofball. I had my try-except block inside my while loop, which accepted the integer 4 just fine. Then the program continued on to display the message, and I wasn't looking for exceptions there. So basically my loop exited as soon as category_number_int was set to 4, and my try-except block was obsolete because it was only catching errors inside my loop.

- **Exercise 4.**
- [X] Use the following tuple to modify my solution to exercise 4 in homework 2. (Download my solution from the Homework Solutions page.)

`bestsellers = ('The Reckoning - John Grisham','Becoming – Michelle Obama','The Thin Man - Dashiell Hammett','Food, Health, and Happiness – Oprah Winfrey','Lonely Planet US’)`

- [X] Add an additional option to the list called ‘Print List’.
- [X] Using the ‘for’ looping construct and print() statement to print the complete list of bestsellers. For the moment we will pretend print() outputs to the printer and not the interpreter console.
- [X] Run your application and select ‘Print List’. Take a snapshot of the Shell window for submission.
- [X] You can access individual elements of a tuple by using an index. For example, bestsellers[0] will return 'The Reckoning - John Grisham' and bestsellers[1] will return 'Becoming – Michelle Obama'. Notice that the index starts at 0 not 1. Place the bestsellers tuple at the beginning of your program and replace all the book text entries in the if construct with a command tuple(index) statement.

- **Exercise 5.**
- [X] Modify EG6-18 as directed in the Do the Make Something Happen on page 167.
- [X] Create an alarm that will sound the shift change at the shipyard.
- [X] Make it whistle once for first shift (8AM), twice for second shift (4PM), and three times for third shift (12 midnight).
- [X] Download and use the whistle.wav file.

- **Homework Submission**

1. A zip file containing the .py file for excercises 1 to 5 and the snapshot from exercise 3.

/*
Module Five, Chapter Three exercises
Ethan Miller
ITSE 2309
*/
```

- [X] Number each exercise in a comment and skip space between them.
- [X] 1) Write an SQL SELECT statement that will return all rows and all columns from the vendors table sorted by Zip Code. (This one is done as an example above.)

```
-- #1

SELECT *
FROM vendors
ORDER BY vendorZipCode;
```

- [X] 2) Write an SQL SELECT statement that will
- return three columns from the vendors table: *vendorContactFName*, *vendorContactLName*, and *vendorName*.
- [X] Sort the result set by last name, then by first name.  (Examine the field names carefully; *I* would have used simply v_lname instead of vendorContactLName; I tend to use terse field names.)

```
-- #2

SELECT vendorContactFName AS [First Name], vendorContactLName AS [Last Name], vendorName AS [Vendor Name]

FROM vendors
ORDER BY vendorContactLName ASC, vendorContactFName ASC;
```

- [X] 3) Write an SQL SELECT statement that will return four columns from the invoices table named number, total, credits, and balanceDue (use AS to assign column aliases):

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| i_num | Column alias for the invoiceNumber field |
| total | Column alias for the invoiceTotal field |
| credits | ==The==  ==sum==  ==of the paymentTotal and creditTotal fields== |
| balanceDue | invoiceTotal minus the credits ([defined on the previous line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEO5a8DbANc&index=8&t=1h20m44s&list=PLYAz1Lwo4O587rxMb1sTe8oXLDvrbkCo6)) |

You might be inclined to try:

*SELECT paymentTotal + creditTotal AS credits,*  ==invoiceTotal -==  ==credits==  *AS balanceDue *and it would certainly make sense to do so; however, it won't work in SQL Server.

Order the output by invoiceNumber.

```

SELECT invoiceNumber AS [i_num], invoiceTotal AS [total], paymentTotal + creditTotal AS [credits], invoiceTotal - (paymentTotal + creditTotal) AS [balanceDue]

FROM invoices
ORDER BY invoiceNumber ASC;
```

- [X] 4) Write an SQL SELECT statement that will return one column from the vendors table named fullName.
- [X] Derive this column from the vendorContactFName and vendorContactLName
- [X] Format it as follows: last name followed by a comma followed by a space followed by the first name.  For example: if the vendorContactFName were 'Joe' and the vendorContactLName were 'Bloe', then fullName would be 'Bloe, Joe'.  To review how to do this, see pages 94 and 95 in Chapter Three of the textbook.
- [X] Sort the result set by last name, then by first name.

```
SELECT CONCAT(vendorContactLName,', ',vendorContactFName) AS [fullName]
FROM vendors
ORDER BY vendorContactLName ASC, vendorContactFName ASC;
```

- [X] 5) Write an SQL SELECT statement that will return three columns

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| invoiceTotal | From the invoices table |
| tenPerCent | invoiceTotal * 0.1 (or 10%) |
| plusTenPercent | The value of invoiceTotal plus 10% |

- [X] (For example: if invoiceTotal were 10,000, then 10% of that would be 1,000.  plusTenPercent would be 1,1000.)
- [X] Only return rows where where balanceDue is greater than 1,000 (and, if you forgot how to do that, review the way you calculated that field in exercise #3).
- [X] Sort the result set by invoiceTotal in descending order (largest invoice first). (Do not worry about trailing zeros to the right of the decimal in the output.)

```

SELECT invoiceTotal AS [total], invoiceTotal * 0.1 AS [tenPerCent], invoiceTotal * 1.1 AS plusTenPercent

FROM invoices
WHERE invoiceTotal - (paymentTotal + creditTotal) > 1000
ORDER BY invoiceTotal DESC;
```

- [X] 6) Modify the solution to exercise #3 to return only rows with an invoiceTotal greater than or equal to 500 but less than or equal to 10,000.

(Many programmers would choose to use '<=' and '>=' with an "AND" clause; however, the BETWEEN operator covered on pages 110, 111 would also work equally well.  Just bear in mind that "between" can be ambiguous with respect to the end values; BETWEEN will work as you want it to here.)

```

SELECT invoiceNumber AS [i_num], invoiceTotal AS [total], paymentTotal + creditTotal AS [credits], invoiceTotal - (paymentTotal + creditTotal) AS [balanceDue]

FROM invoices
WHERE invoiceTotal >= 500 AND invoiceTotal <= 10000
ORDER BY invoiceNumber ASC;
```

- [X] 7) Modify the solution to exercise #4 to return only contacts whose last name (vendorContactLName) begins with the letter 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'E'.

There exist a number of ways to accomplish this.

- The LEFT(vendorContactLName, 1) function described on page 98 and 99 with the IN operator on pages 108 and 109 might be handy.
- It could also be accomplished using a series of LIKE statements from pages 112 and 113 joined by OR.

```
SELECT CONCAT(vendorContactLName,', ',vendorContactFName) AS [fullName]
FROM vendors
WHERE VendorContactLName LIKE '[A-C,E]%'
ORDER BY vendorContactLName ASC, vendorContactFName ASC;
```

- [X] 8) Write an SQL SELECT statement that will return the invoiceNumber, paymentDate, and balanceDue (just like we did it in #3 and #6 above) for any invalid paymentDate values. To be valid,
- paymentDate must be NULL if the balanceDue is greater than zero
- and NOT NULL if the balanceDue = 0.

Now, this exercise pushes your logic!  Notice that it asks you to return invalid rows; however, the exercise defines what a valid row is!  Yes, that was deliberate!  Order the output by invoiceNumber.

```

SELECT invoiceNumber AS [i_num], paymentDate AS [paymentDate], invoiceTotal - (paymentTotal + creditTotal) AS [balanceDue]

FROM invoices

WHERE (invoiceTotal - (paymentTotal + creditTotal) > 0 AND paymentDate IS NOT NULL) OR

(invoiceTotal - (paymentTotal + creditTotal) = 0 AND paymentDate IS NULL)
ORDER BY invoiceNumber ASC;
```

# eBay Return

Howdy from Texas,

I'm writing you because the Alfani suit I purchased had a number of small holes / stains in the pants (see pictures). I'm going to have to take some of the excess fabric from the rear hemline to make a patch for it, which is fine, but it will be a hassle and take some time / research, and in the end it won't be as nice as the excellent condition that was advertised.

I don't necessarily want to return it, but given the amount of work it's going to take and the higher depreciation in quality than either of us realized, I would like a $10 discount, if you agree that that's reasonable.

I hope you have a great day.

Created

Thursday, Feb 14, 2019, 1:15 PM

**Homework 1:**  Using pip and snap in Book Exercises

- **Exercise 1.**
- [X] Step 1. Create a virtual environment called ‘ITSE1359’. (See Lab 2 for assistance.)

```
cd A:\Users\Ethan\Documents\virtualenvironments
--
python –m venv ITSE1359
```

- [X] Step 2. Examine the documentation for pygame on [PyPi.org](https://pypi.org/project/Pygame/#description).
- [X] Step 3. Activate ITSE1359 and install ‘pygame’ using pip.

```
cd ITSE1359\Scripts
--
activate
```

- [X] Step 4. Download the [samples file](https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/store/begin-to-code-with-python-9781509304523#downloads) from the download section of the textbook’s website. See page xxii at the front of the book for information on downloading examples and files. Extract all the zipped files.
- [X] Step 5. Create a subdirectory in ITSE1359 called ‘homework’.
- [X] Step 6. Create a subdirectory in homework called ‘chp3’.
- [X] Step 7. Copy the *snaps.py* file *from the chapter three example* directory into your new **chp3** directory. Any .py file you save in this directory will have access to the snaps.py. Unfortunately, the book author did not create a single snaps.py file but separate ones for each chapter. You will need to maintain separate chapter subdirectories each with its own snaps.py.
- [X] Move the Housemartins.jpg and ding.wav to the chp3 folder
- [X] <s>Add the Pygame library (pg. 65)

</s>
`<s>py -m pip install pygame --user</s>`

- [X] Install Pygame under ITSE1359

```
cd ..
--
pip install pygame
```

- [X] Step 8. Run the IDLE editor [in the virtual environment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4924068/how-to-launch-python-idle-from-a-virtual-environment-virtualenv).

```
<s>python -m idlelib.idle</s>
<s>-- OR</s>
python –m idlelib
```

- [X] Step 9. Type, save, and run code samples EG3-04, EG3-05, and EG3-06 from pages 66-68.

```

# EG3-04 hello world

#import snaps
from snaps import display_message

display_message('hello world')

---------------------------------------------------------

# EG3-05 housemartins

import snaps

snaps.display_image('Housemartins.jpg')
snaps.display_message('Hull Rocks',color=(255,255,255),vert='top')

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# EG3-06 Ding

import snaps

snaps.play_sound('ding.wav')
```

- [X] Take screenshots of the results of running EG3-04 and EG3-05.

- **Homework Submission**
- [X] 1. A zip file containing the three .py files and the two .png files. Remember to use the proper naming convention.

**Homework ****2:** Branching Control Structures

- **Exercise 1.**
- [X] Step 1. Create a subdirectory in homework called ‘chp4’ in your homework directory and populate it with the correct [snaps.py](file:///A:/Users/Ethan/OneDrive%20for%20Business/Documents/Academic%20Documents/Spring%202019/ITSE%201359%20(Python)/Week%201/Ch%2004%20Working%20with%20Data%20in%20Python) file as you did in Homework 1.
- [X] Step 2. Activate ITSE1359 and run IDLE so that it has access to all the virtual environment’s resources. Review Lecture 3 for help.

```
cd A:\Users\Ethan\Documents\virtualenvironments\ITSE1359\Scripts
--
activate
--
cd ..
--
python –m idlelib
```

- [X] Step 4. Recreate EG4-05 and EG4-06 found on page 101.

```

# EG4-05 Seattle Temperature

import snaps

temp = snaps.get_weather_temp(latitude=47.61, longitude=-122.33)
print('The temperature in Seattle is:', temp)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# EG4-06 Seattle Weather

import snaps

desc=snaps.get_weather_desciption(latitude=47.61, longitude=-122.33)
print('The conditions are:',desc)
```

- [X] Step 5. Create a program following the instructions for the Make Something Happen section on page 102. Make it as fancy or simple as you wish. Remember that the program must meet the client’s (the professor) specifications (contained in Make Something Happen).

```

# EG4-Bonus Wylie Weather App

import snaps

temp = snaps.get_weather_temp(latitude=33.06, longitude=-96.54)
desc = snaps.get_weather_desciption(latitude=33.06, longitude=-96.54)
str1 = 'The temperature in Wylie is: '
str2 = '\nThe conditions are: '
snaps.display_message(str1+str(temp)+str2+desc, size=65)
```

- [X] Step 6. Save your program and take a screenshot of your output window.

**Exercise 2.**

- [X] Step 1. Create a subdirectory called chp5 and populate it accordingly.
- [X] Step 2. Examine the example code up to EG5-13.
- [X] Step 3. Create an application that meets the following specification:
- a. Displays the books.png file centered at the top of the window.
        - [ ] Override the snaps.py file to prevent image scaling

```
def display_image(filepath):
    '''
    Displays the image from the given filepath
    Starts pygame if required
    May throw exceptions
    '''
    global surface
    global window_size
    global image

    handle_events()
    image = pygame.image.load(filepath)
    image = pygame.transform.smoothscale(image, window_size)
    surface.blit(image, (0, 0))
    pygame.display.flip()
```

- b. Displays a list of book types and when the user selects a specific type, the best seller in that category is displayed. The five categories and associated best sellers are listed in the following table.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Fiction | The Reckoning - John Grisham |
| Non-fiction | Becoming – Michelle Obama |
| Mystery | Becoming – Michelle Obama |
| Cooking | Food, Health, and Happiness – Oprah Winfrey |
| Travel | Lonely Planet USA |

- c. Add an additional option that randomly selects a category and displays the book and book type.

```

Hello,

Just wanted to let you know that my flat rate padded envelopes finally came yesterday and I shipped the suits back your way this morning. I couldn't find where to add return tracking details to the return request, but estimated delivery is January 22.

Here are the USPS Tracking #'s:
9405 5036 9930 0390 8046 83
9405 5036 9930 0390 8046 90

- [X] Ask for measurements

Howdy,

Could you tell me what the following measurements for this suit are?

1. Yoke:
2. Jacket Half Chest:
3. Jacket Half Waist:
4. Jacket Back Length:
5. Sleeve Length:
6. Jacket Half Armhole:
7. Pants Half Waist
8. Pants Inseam

If you don't know how to take these measurement, just Google, "guide to a perfect men's suit fit - Modern Tailor." There will be a PDF detailing exactly where to measure from.

Thanks!

- [ ] Ask for Midnight Blue Measurements

Hi,

Could you tell me what the sleeve length is if you measure from the shoulder's seam all along the arm until the end of the jacket sleeve? You can use the "guide to a perfect men's suit fit - Modern Tailor" PDF online to see what I'm talking about. Also could you measure the Jacket Half Armhole?

I had a question about the sleeve length. Is that figure of 20" Just visually looking at it seems like it should be closer to 24". If you could double check using the "guide to a perfect men's suit fit - Modern Tailor" PDF online, and also measure the Jacket Half Armhole, that'd be great.

Thanks!

Very upbeat, positive folks. Easy to work with and great communication. I ended up returning two out of three suits that I bought and they refunded the money no questions asked. Buy with confidence.

# This morning I felt like I was leaving everything I know
Created

Sunday, Jan 13, 2019, 8:36 PM

This morning I felt like I was leaving everything I know. Tonight I feel like I'm coming back to a wasteland. All the activity, all the people, all of the lifeblood and energy is back in Fort Worth. I left a group of brothers in great fellowship and likeminded company, and I walked into my house to my family watching a reality TV show with brainwashing music. The Spirit in Fort Worth is amazing. The spirit here is dead. The spirit there is exciting and encouraging, and stimulating. There's nothing at home except a bed. It's quiet. I usually have a headache on Sunday afternoons as I take a nap. I put forth my hands to work for the Lord this afternoon and I feel great now.

Pastor Shelley is a really great guy. His preaching is on par with Pastor Anderson's, and he's extremely humble. He greeted me no different than any of the brethren. Brother Jason from Garland, Brother Ryan, Brother Media dude, Brother Jacob from east Texas, Brother Jared (Jacob's brother), Brother Chris (Jacob's roommate, moved here in September from Michigan), Brother Canadian dude (also moved here in September), Brother Michael, Brother Elijah, Brother Ian, Brother Tony, Brother Steven. I love all the people there. Pastor Shelley was a software developer for a medical company. He told me he's a self-taught developer, and even created a curriculum for Elliot Ray to help him get an actual career. He was making something like 103K at his job. Who is my brother? And who is my mother? It truly is the spirit of comradery that I know at Stedfast.

I'm motivated now more than ever to wake up early and learn React. With Pastor Shelley saying that it's a good career that's basically all about how hard you work, and you can get good pay if you work hard, I feel driven to show myself approved by my labor. He said it's like anything else, you have to be self-motivated to do it, and excel at it. He really was just a positive guy and full of life. Very upbeat and welcoming. I feel like I've known him for years. He just immediately treated me like a friend.

# I'm going to Stedfast Jacksonville this Sunday

3 Reasons:
1. New leadership (didn't like Romero's voice)
2. Pastor Logan Robertson's sermon, "You're Not In The New IFB Movement"
    - [You're Not In The New IFB Movement.mp3](../_resources/You're%20Not%20In%20The%20New%20IFB%20Movement.mp3)

3. [Brother Norm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMMWmwlBAaA)'s charge to make the drive to church
- Bro. [Richard Symes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7k548zizJk&t=6m25s)

All of these events occurred within the span of one week. I think the Lord is telling me that now is the time to move churches. I've been praying to God that I would have the Spirit of Elijah and be a zealous Christian, and this is the arrow God is handing to me to smite the ground with: Stedfast Baptist Church. Am I going to smite it against the ground until there's no more arrow left, or am I going to just, "1, 2, 3," and go home? It's time to be found stedfast, abiding in the work of the Lord.

Things to do to prepare:
- [X] Northlake Hospitality Committee
- [X] Tell my Sunday School class that I went to Stedfast Baptist Church in Fort Worth to support Pastor Jonathan Shelley
- [X] Prepare testimony (Let the redeemed of the Lord say so)
- [X] Gain courage to be baptized (without my family as witnesses -- who is my brother and my mother?)
- [X] Put phone charger in Corolla
- [x] Permission to use Faith's phone because it's faster
- [X] Permission to drive 1 hour and 15 minutes weekly to Fort Worth (this will be good for overcoming my fear of driving)
- [X] Stay there until the evening service (see about soul-winning / carpooling if it's not local, read Bible / memorize verses in free time)
- 
- [X] Emergency money for gas
- [X] Money for lunch
- [X] Case the area to see what's around (food-wise)
- [X] Get plans straight (10 credit hours at Collin College + 30 hours of independent studies + 10 hours of homework, internship in summer, job by August)
- [X] Figure out what they wear (suit or more casual?)
- [X] Decide to get there 15-30 minutes early in order to talk to people there and account for first time confusion
- Service at 10:30 AM, ==leave by 9 AM==, wake up by 8 AM, EAT BREAKFAST
- [X] Decide that I'm going to be social and actually ask, "Is someone sitting here?" rather than choose a secluded spot.
- [X] Prepare gospel presentation for soul-winning
- [X] Choose sermon for car ride
- [X] Pack a change of clothes

It's time for me to start taking my Christian walk seriously, and it's really hard to do that at Sardis. It's hard to do that at a church that's dead, or at a church that's worldly. I need to be in a church that will spur me on towards good works. Not a church that makes me study to defend my position that we should even go soul-winning in the first place. Maybe I do have to give up what I want. Maybe I have to give up seeing Amy every week and my plans of changing my personality so as to make her love me, but if I don't do this, I wasn't going to be transformed enough to make her fall in love with me anyway. It's time I please God instead of my own belly. I'm going to have the faith of Abraham, like when he moved out of his country on faith.

Back when I was unsaved I used to listen to Piper a lot, and he was the one voice that said, "It's faith alone. It's faith alone. Don't you dare add anything to the cross of Jesus. It's not your fruit, it's his blood." And so for me to hear him say things like, "If you don't stop fornicating you will go to hell," is hard for me. He was like an anchor for me that kept me from just killing myself.

It's really been a blessing to be here, and a great privilege. I don't think people really understand how great it is to be with like-minded believers until they've spent years and years in watered-down churches that preach from the NASB, promote friendship evangelism, talk about movies and music in their conversations, lift up Billy Graham and other false prophets. It's just like coming out of a cold, and you've been miserable for a few days, and now you can breathe, and you feel great, and you have a special appreciation for being healthy.

- When I went to apply, I tried logging in with my cougar account, and it rejected my credentials, so I created an account with my cougarmail.
- When I was first admitted, it would have been on many.millers@verizon.net, but the website said that address didn't have an account.

- I recieved an [email](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/2/#inbox/FMfcgxwBTsgVMTjPwGRDLptgbShrmQjq) on January 3rd informing me that my application had been processed and my information remained the same. I don't know how they knew my application corresponded to emiller25 since I didn't provide that information, but I suppose their database is more sophisticated than I imagined. It might have been my driver's license number, or my street address in conjunction with my name that was already linked to emiller25. I don't know. I'm just surprised they didn't ask for my already-existing account during the application. I'm glad it worked out though.
