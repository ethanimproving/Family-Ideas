**Considerations**

I need to make some decisions about which locations are suitable for work, taking to mind the following considerations:

- Am I willing to move to any of the 30 [New IFB church](https://www.thenewifb.com/church-directory) locations? (No)
- Am I willing to move in between work and church? (Yes)
- How long of a commute to church am I willing to make? (30 minutes)
- How long of a commute to work am I willing to make? (30 minutes)
- Am I willing to move into my own house or apartment? (Yes)

If I move in-between church and work, half my friends will live on one side of town, and half my friends will live on the other. It would be more preferable for church, work, and home to be all clustered together. Nevertheless, I would be willing to make the distance from my work to my church twice the distance from my house to my work

**Motivation of considerations**

 It's helpful to know what I am willing and am not willing to do before I apply for jobs for two reasons:

1. So I know where to look for jobs.

2. So if a job responds, I will already have defined my standards of flexibility so I'm not a deer in the headlights when they ask questions I wasn't prepared for.

I will not accept a job further than 40 minutes from Steadfast new location. If I do move to the Arlington area, I want my house to be between church and home in Wylie / Garland.

**3 places of interest**
The way I see it, there are 3 main places of interest to me:

1. Stedfast Baptist Church,
2. Family,
3. Northlake Baptist Church.

**Map locations**

Using [traveltimeplatform.com](https://app.traveltimeplatform.com/search/0_lng=-97.04434%260_color=%23eb9f22%260_mode=driving%260_title=East%20Avenue%20J%2C%20Grand%20Prairie%2C%20TX%2C%20USA%260_lat=32.76720%261_lng=-96.61390%261_color=%2339d2e2%261_mode=driving%261_title=Northlake%20Baptist%20Church%2C%20Garland%2C%20TX%2C%20USA%261_lat=32.92730%262_lat=33.04136%262_lng=-96.56308%262_title=1310%20Leeward%20Ln%2C%20Wylie%2C%20TX%2C%20USA%262_mode=driving) to construct a 30 minute driving radius around all 3 locations, I've determined the best location to move to is Richardson. It's 20 minutes from home, 5 minutes from Northlake, and less than 30 minutes to Stedfast. Here is an Excel Spreadsheet of the locations that best satisfy my top 3 priorities in ascending order:
