I was listening to a soul-winning sermon last night by Pastor Steven Anderson when he gave a quick anecdote of going out soul-winning with a church member, and I thought how cool it would be to be in one of those stories. And this morning [Pastor Shelley said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L27G1kQB7p8&t=1h25m31s), "Brother Ethan and I were knocking doors and this guy's like, 'Yeah, I'm not interested. I was thrown out of my church for being gay.'"
