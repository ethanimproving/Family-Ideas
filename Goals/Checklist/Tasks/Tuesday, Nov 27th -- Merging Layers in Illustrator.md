**Work Tasks**

- **Time sheet**
- [X] 11Â Hours Coding

My prayers are not as satisfying when I have to cut them short, and neglect to pin down the details of what's behind my inclinations and hindrances. What's behind my feelings? What's behind my hindrance to asking someone to date me on faith that I will get a job later? I like to answer those questions, but time must be respected before curiosity. I'll answer it another time. I do feel really good that I've started an hour and a half earlier than yesterday.
