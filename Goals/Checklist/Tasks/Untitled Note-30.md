I am against any kind of systematic theology. I'm not joking. When you go into a college to learn somebody's system, you bring his theological system into the text instead of drawing out the interpretation from the text. They teach you not to do eisegesis, and then they almost invariably commit that same error by teaching you systematic theology.
