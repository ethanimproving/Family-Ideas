Howdy from Texas,

I'm writing you because the Alfani suit I purchased had a number of small holes / stains in the pants (see pictures). I'm going to have to take some of the excess fabric from the rear hemline to make a patch for it, which is fine, but it will be a hassle and take some time / research, and in the end it won't be as nice as the excellent condition that was advertised.

I don't necessarily want to return it, but given the amount of work it's going to take and the higher depreciation in quality than either of us realized,Â I would like a $10 discount, if you agree that that's reasonable.

I hope you have a great day.
