Honestly when I'm working on my own project, I'll just create a project TODO.txt. It's convenient, it's right there in my project, and I don't have to do anything to get to it.

Agile is like a sophisticated TODO list on a feature-by-feature basis rather than a step-by-step basis.

Your team estimates the amount of work involved for each item as a part of the Release Backlog.

Estimates less than 1 day are 1, 2, 4, or 8. Larger items are estimated as 2 days, 3 days, 5 days, or 10 days. Extremely large items are estimated in months. 1, 2, 3, or 6 months.

The TODO items are called User Stories. They are the feature requests from the client.

Sprints are short duration milestones that allow teams to tackle a manageable chunk of the project and get it to a ship-ready state.
