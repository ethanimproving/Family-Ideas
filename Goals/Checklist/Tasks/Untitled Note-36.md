I'm not an IFB personality. I'm not simpleminded enough. I do ask questions. I do look at both sides of the coin. They call valid arguments foolish questions when they can't answer it. They insinuate you're a false brother when you disagree about some miner thing. But not the whole IFB. Only one member: Jesse Michael, whereof I've witnessed to be a blasphemer, hardened against the truth, rejecting the Holy Ghost which caused Peter to say, "David speaketh." If this was done in ignorance, let his sin be remitted. But if from knowledge, let it be retained.
