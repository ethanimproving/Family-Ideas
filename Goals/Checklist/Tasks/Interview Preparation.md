Tip 1: I really **don't care** about that job, whether I get it or I don't, it doesn't matter.

Tip 2: Imagine it's me **talking to a friend** or a student.

Tip 3: Just **start talking** and things will smooth out. (Jitters go away in the first 30 seconds.) Loosen up.

"You would use HTML to create a form, and then you'd have that form submit to a route on the back-end, and you would intercept that request with jQuery or vanilla JavaScript, pull the information from the form, send it to the back-end, and that's where you would parse that text, do whatever you want to do with it to count the occurrence of a unique word, put it in a sorted list, and then send it back to the client."

Greeting: Hey this is Ethan Miller. What can I do for you? [
How are you today?: Pretty good. Just, it's a good Thursday. How's yours?

Tell me what you do, what got you into coding?

Actually I was training to be a CADD technician with my brother in Feb 2018, and so I was learning a software called Microstation, where you build construction designs for bridges or whatever the project they give you is. So as I was training to be a CADD technician, my brother had been wanting to create some tools in VBA, but he didn't have time to learn it, so he gave me a PDF tutorial on how to use Visual Basic inside Microstation and asked if I would create the tools, so I spent a day learning Visual Basic, and then created the tools he wanted. And I started thinking, "I kind of like making the tools better than I like using the tools." It kind of gave me a charge. But then at Halff Associates where I was going to work, an Engineer ended up quitting, so the position fell through, and I thought: "Rather than be a CADD Tech, I think I'm going to learn how to be a programmer." So I just started learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript from tutorials on YouTube, and courses online, and just kept adding other languages little by little as I kept thinking, "Man, it would be great to send data from this form to a database." So I'd learn SQL, MongoDB. A lot of the languages I learned was because there was something I had in mind to to build. But really it was just the buzz I got when I starting building things in Visual Basic that prompted me to become a programmer. It was a total accident.

**You mentioned that you have React projects, right?**

Oh yeah, the government contract position was all React and PHP.

**Do you have experience with unit testing?**

In what capacity? Like TDD? I've done Jasmine, very briefly.

How would you make a site for people with disabilities?

aria labels -- chrome extensions to check if they're understandable.

[What to Do If You Can't Answer an Interview Question](https://www.popsugar.com/career/What-Do-You-Cant-Answer-Interview-Question-33925868)

Don't say, "I don't know," off the bat. And don't make stuff up.

Do you have experience with unit testing? || Tell me what unit testing is.

I would have to Google what unit testing is, so I probably don't have experience with it, but on the off chance that it means something like just debugging units of your code, it's possible that I have experience with it and just haven't heard the name of what I was doing.

"It's a good question, but I'm sorry, I don't have the answer off the top of my head. I will be sure to follow up with the answer after the interview."

A lot of times people will say things like, "Do you have experience with object oriented programming?" And I mistakenly say, "Why no I haven't," because I haven't heard that phrasing when in reality I'm very familiar with it in work that I've done in Python with classes, or in JavaScript with Object Literal Notation.
