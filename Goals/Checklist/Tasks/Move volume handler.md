Tomorrow just focus on learning to move the handler element across the X axis by dragging / sliding / moving it with your cursor. Once I have that, I'm confident I can find the JavaScript to convert the number of pixels it is positioned from the left border into a volume property.

- [X] Make volume handler slide with cursor
- [X] Make horizontal bar slide with cursor
- [X] Convert left position values to numbers
- [X] Relay converted numbers to audio controller
