Create a Python console program (add GUI later) called "Batch File Handler" that renames batch files in a directory. Have the ability to exclude certain files in the chosen directory (and add them by browsing, multiple at a time).

This app was really just to have a handy place to store the commands that do this manually. I honestly don't even use the python app. But maybe it could have me select what I'm doing (getting names of already-downloaded YouTube files, batch renaming files, etc) and then give me the commands/instructions for accomplishing that. Click on the command to copy it to clipboard.

Create characters after the fashion of the designs on [study.com](http://study.com/)Â (formerly education portal) and have them shake in random intervals while talking.
