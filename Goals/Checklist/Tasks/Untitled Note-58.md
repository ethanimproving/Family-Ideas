Reflecting on the business challenges this year, think how you approached your work. Summarize your accomplishments and areas you would like to focus your development.

**Work Approach**: Teamwork

The focus of my work this year has been to use the knowledge and experience of my seniors and the SMEs on our team as a resource to raise my own independent capabilities as a product engineer. That being said, my approach was not to minimize my interactions with seniors, but to extract as much information from each of them as possible. A slack message is 10 times quicker than a Google search, and a video call is 10 times faster than trial and error. I have learned to reach out for help from people who have expertise in particular areas, whether Sandeep for Load Testing, Erick for Dynatrace, etc. Each pairing session has provided me with valuable insights and skills about how to do my job effectively. Everyone is always very willing to spare a few minutes of their time to spare me from hours of troubleshooting, even following up afterwards to make sure it worked. I love that about this team.

**Accomplishments**: Independence

I've gained valuable skills to independently work on User Stories requiring QA Automation, Performance Testing, Kubernetes, Sabre, ADO, On-call Support, Design Patterns, Java Profiling, and more.

**Development**:

The areas I want to focus my development is subject to whatever will be valuable for the work we have assigned, but as it stands now I would like to become more proficient in (1) logging tools, (2) understanding the business flow of our products across the entire TaR team. More generally I want to continue riding the coattails of all the knowledge I gained in 2020.

save hours of my time, and then next time I already know what to do

I would like to focus my development on understanding the business flow of our products across the entire TaR team. This can be achieved either through extensive study on our team's Wikis, or through cross-squad pairing. This will help me become more comfortable being on call for TaR in the future.

Another area of development I would like to focus on is logging. I can perform basic queries in Kibana, but I would like to learn its limitations in grabbing statistics from our logs.

More generally I want to continue riding the coattails of all the knowledge I gained in 2020. A lot of the hard work is behind me, being assigned a US in any of these comes easy to me now.

 to independantly

The focus of my work this year was to be able to be assigned a User Story and complete it without being dependent on my seniors.

and the amount I've learned over the past year seems overwhelming to think about, but it was little by little. I didn't have to suffer through hours of troubleshooting to get where I am because I used the knowledge and experience of my seniors as a resource to find the right solutions. I allow myself 15 minutes of suffering before I reach out. Usually it's just about finding the right people, and everyone is always very willing to spare a few minutes of their time to save hours of my time, and then next time I already know what to do.

- TDD and Wiremock / PowerMock

- Java Profiling (Memory leaks, etc)
- Kubernetes / Autoscaling
- Kibana (Monitoring / On-call support)
- Virtualization (Dev Test)
- Load Testing (Performance Center, Load Runner, Jmeter, Hey, Dynatrace)
- ADO Pipeline stages & tasks
- Cucumber & ReadyAPI Automation

What will I CONTINUE doing to leverage my skills?
What will I START doing to incorporate skills in my role/department?

Leveraging Skills:

(1) Take User Stories that require them. (2) Help teammates that could use them. (3) Learn to be articulate so that I can pass on the skills I've learned effectively.

Gaining Skills:

(1) Reaching out to the appropriate slack channels / SMEs, (2) Friday Learning Journey, (3) adding learning notes to our `Team - Edge` Wiki in Teams, (4) work on User Stories that require skills I don't have yet, (5) Cross-squad pairing
