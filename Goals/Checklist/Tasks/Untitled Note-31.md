I feel bad. I got a screen in phone interview from a company that found my resume on Indeed.com, but since I didn't apply for the position, I didn't know anything about it, except that it was for a senior .NET engineer, and the extend of my .NET framework knowledge is C++/CLR, and what .NET usually means is C# or ASP.NET, neither of which I know anything about, so I thought, "I'm going to flunk the screen-in," and I didn't do it immediately, and then I forgot about it, and now I've lost it. So, AHHH! I'm mad at myself.
