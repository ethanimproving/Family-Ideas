Nobody is calling for private citizens to go vigilante on the LQBT community. It's the government's job to punish evil doers (1 Peter 2:14).

Leviticus 20:13 "If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them." There's a difference between that person being put to death and saying everybody has free reign to go murder that person.

It's the same difference between the courts upholding capital punishment in the majority of states while simultaneously affirming federal legislation regarding murder in 18 U.S. Code § 1111. A serial rapist who molests children and murders them afterwards full well deserves to be put to death, but they still have to go through due process of law.

Everybody has their own opinions.

There's a difference between having an opinion on what the law should be and calling for lawlessness.

It's one thing to say that there are crimes worthy of death. It's another thing to say

Obviously this command is for private citizens or  and every other instance of capital punishment would make no sense.

It's not the job of private citizens to punish evildoers.

That's what the government is for.
