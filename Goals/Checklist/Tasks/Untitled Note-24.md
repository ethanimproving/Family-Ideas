Great article! I like that you're getting us to think outside the box. I agree that Selection Sort is probably more efficient than Bubble Sort in most cases. I tested the the examples in the article against each other by passing in names=['Faith','Caleb','Ethan','deborah','Brian','Anna'] into both functions, and the Selection Sort ran 64 lines of code, while the Bubble Sort took 104 to get the job done. (I just turned on the debugger and stepped into the functions to manually count how many steps it took). Surprising difference!

There's also a built-in function in Python called [sorted()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=sorted#sorted), that enables you to sort a list in descending or ascending order, as well as [sum()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=sum#sum) and [mean()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html?highlight=mean#statistics.mean) for totaling or averaging numeric data (although you have to import the statistics module to use the mean() function).

I got curious about the author's assessment that Selection Sort frequently outperforms Bubble Sort, so I passed names=['Faith','Caleb','Ethan','deborah','Brian','Anna'] into the Bubble Sort vs. the  Selection Sort examples in the article, and the Selection Sort ran 64 lines of code, while the Bubble Sort took 104  to get the job done. (I just turned on the debugger and stepped into the functions to manually count how many steps it took).

Crazy right?

(surprisingly)

I used it sorted(names, key=str.upper)

I was about to agree about the efficiency of the selection sort method, based on the author's

 I agree that Selection Sort tends to iterate less than Bubble sort.

I like that article. There are so many ways to accomplish the same task.
