There was this girl I knew-- she was a wonderful woman, just beautiful, and godly, and she loved the Lord-- I mean, I had a massive crush on her, but I was too shy to ask her out because she was a little older than me, and there was another guy handsomer than me, a youth pastor that she was flirty with, so I never gave her any attention or showed her interest.

Make a video about Amy. My last thoughts about her and blessing on her. Her virtues can serve as a lesson. "You can't always expect to find this girl." I guarantee I'm not going to find a girl I love more than her. No one is going to outmatch her heart. But I'm just going to find an average girl and try to push her to love God, and lead her. Don't wait around for that unicorn perfect wife, you only have 60 years. Just settle down, find someone you like that you're compatible with, who has you general same goals, and marry her. Don't think, "Well I have to wait for a girl that's better than girl A." NoÂ you don't.
