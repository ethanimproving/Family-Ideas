Introvert, extrovert? I'm not really sure. My attitude towards going out is kind of like my attitude towards running. When I do it consistently then I love doing it, and I look forward to it every day. If I haven't done it for awhile then I get lazy and I don't feel like doing it. Running is rewarding, but it takes work. Being social is rewarding in a similar way. I have to overcome my initial aversion to going out, but when I do go out, and the oxitocin is running through my system, I feel great, and then when I come back home, I can't wait to get out of the house again because I'm pumped up full of energy and great feelings. That's why if I go to the dentist, and then come back home, I'm way more likely to go to the mall or call a friend and do something. I'm already dressed, I look great, my shoes are on, I've got the good feelings of social interaction still in my system, and I want to go out for more.

But you put me in quarantine and I become a depressed hermit. I don't feel like going out. I don't feel like getting out of bed. All I want to do is sleep and listen to breakup songs, and work work on projects. If I was planning to go to church on Wednesday night, but by the time I'm finished working I'm tired and burned out, and I don't feel like getting in the car.

So in one sense, I'm extroverted in the sense that I draw energy from social interactions. I have way more life inside of me when I'm out and about and talking to people. I get depressed when I stay in. But on the other hand when I am depressed because I've been staying in, I don't feel like being social. I just want to stay inside. And in that sense I'm introverted.Â It takes work to go out. What will we talk about?

I'll to you what, I love saving 3 hours driving time working from home. But I was a lot happier when I was seeing all my friends at the office every day and going on adventures around campus. We had pool, ping pong, a mall of a building. It was incredible. I miss that. But if you ask you right now, "Do you want to go back to the office?" I would say no. Why would I say no if I know it would make me happier? Because it takes work. 3 hours of driving every day is not fun. It's work. It's waste. I get less done in my day. That's 3 hours I could just drive down to the mall and see people there. But I don't do it. Why? Because I'm not in the zone. I know that going to the gym will make me happier too. I feel good about myself, my body feels amazing, you walk out more confident. But sometimes you just get lazy.
