Hey Jas, I just wanted to make a video to qualify and expound on what I meant when I said that Romans 3:19 Explains Matthew 5 and 6 and 7.

So context for the video, last Sunday I showed you and Noah John 3:16: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that **whosoever** believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." Just from this one verse, we can tell that every single person who believes on Jesus is saved. Because it says, "Whosoever." So if there's 1 person who believes in Jesus and does not have eternal life, and ends up going to hell, then this verse is not true. John 3:18 is not true. John 3:36 is not true. John 6:47 is not true. Acts 16:31 is not true. All of them say something like, "He that believeth on me hath everlasting life."

Matthew 5 is not teaching us how to go to heaven. It's showing us that we fall short. It's showing us our need for a savior.

So if I say a person who believes on Jesus will go to hell,

**The objection.**

**The text.**
Matthew 5:21-22

Ye have heard that it was said of them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:

But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.

**The interpretation: **

Either this text is telling us what we must do to get into heaven, or it's showing our need for a savior.

This is either a salvation text or it's a danger text. Either this text is showing us how to get saved, or it's telling us what the danger is in the first place that we need to get saved from. And the danger is: hell. And the standard is: perfect. And the verdict is: guilty.

And you better not be angry with your brother, because if you are, you go to hell. You go to the hellfire.

**1) It's coherent with the gospel (John 3:16, 18, 36, 6:47, Acts 16:30-31).**
**
**

For an interpretation to be correct, it has to cohere with the rest of the Bible. You are right to observe that there's a contradiction between the proposition that every single person who believes on Jesus goes to heaven and the proposition that if you're angry with your brother you go to hell. The question is, which proposition are we misunderstanding?

**2) ****The purpose of the law is to show us that we need a savior.**

The purpose of the law is not to get us into heaven. Romans 3:20 makes that clear: "Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin." Well then what is the purpose of the law? Verse 19 tells us the answer.

Romans 3:19

Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.

Why is it useful for the world to become guilty before God? Because a person who isn't guilty will not be justified by faith. If you're not guilty, Christ didn't do anything for you. If Christ didn't do anything for you, you're not believing on him for salvation. If you're not believing on him for salvation, you're not saved.

Galatians 3:24

Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.

Romans 10:4
For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.
**
**
**3) Jesus uses the law as a springboard to the gospel in Matthew 19.**

Jesus said, "If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments."

 Both of those are true. If you keep the commandments, you'll enter into life, and nobody keeps the commandments, therefore nobody is justified by the law.

The problem is in Romans 3:20 it says "By the deeds of the law shall no flesh be justified," so why is Jesus saying, "If you want to be justified, do the works of the law?" It sounds like a contradiction. But guess what? The rich young ruler was not justified by the deeds of the law. He went away sad. He didn't go away rejoicing, he didn't go away, "Woo hoo! I'm saved! I've just got to do the works of the law." Because he couldn't do it. And neither can you. [Which brings me to my 4th argument:]

**
**
**4) Nobody keeps the commandments in Matthew 5.**

And if you read Matthew 5 and you say a person who believes of Jesus but gets angry with his brother goes to hell, than you'll go to hell. You will. Thou condemnest thyself.

Matthew 7.

For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.

If it's true that a person who gets saved loses their salvation if they're angry with their brother, then all of us would lose our salvation.

**
**
**5) Salvation is by faith, not of works.**
**
**
Romans 4:5

But to him that **worketh not** [worketh not], but believeth on him that justifieth the **ungodly**, his faith is **counted** for righteousness.

Because we don't get saved by keeping the law. The reason Jesus said, "If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments," is because hypothetically if you kept the law, you'd go to heaven. The problem is Romans 3:23, "for all have sinned." What is sin? Sin is the transgression of the law. It's when you break one of God's commandments. And therefore, practically, by the deeds of the law shall no flesh be justified. Why? Because nobody has kept the law.

So (1) if you keep God's commandments, you will go to heaven. (2) No one has kept God's commandments. (3) No one is going to heaven. This is the divine syllogism that's designed to make us guilty before God. This is called a danger passage.

Where's the solution? The solution is Romans 5:8, "But God commendeth his love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."

Romans 11:6

And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.

Ephesians 2:8-9

For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:

Not of works, lest any man should boast.

Titus 3:5

Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;
