Hello,

Just wanted to let you know that my flat rate padded envelopes finally came yesterday and I shipped the suits back your way this morning. I couldn't find where to add return tracking details to the return request, but estimated delivery is January 22.

Here are the USPS Tracking #'s:
9405 5036 9930 0390 8046 83
9405 5036 9930 0390 8046 90

Howdy,

Could you tell me what the following measurements for this suit are?

1. Yoke:
2. Jacket Half Chest:
3. Jacket Half Waist:
4. Jacket Back Length:
5. Sleeve Length:
6. Jacket Half Armhole:
7. Pants Half Waist
8. Pants Inseam

If you don't know how to take these measurement, just Google, "guide to a perfect men's suit fit - Modern Tailor." There will be a PDF detailing exactly where to measure from.

Thanks!

Hi,

Could you tell me what the sleeve length is if you measure from the shoulder's seam all along the arm until the end of the jacket sleeve? You can use the "guide to a perfect men's suit fit - Modern Tailor" PDF online to see what I'm talking about. Also could you measure the Jacket Half Armhole?

I had a question about the sleeve length. Is that figure of 20" Just visually looking at it seems like it should be closer to 24". If you could double check using the "guide to a perfect men's suit fit - Modern Tailor" PDF online, and also measure the Jacket Half Armhole, that'd be great.

Thanks!

Very upbeat, positive folks. Easy to work with and great communication. I ended up returning two out of three suits that I bought and they refunded the money no questions asked. Buy with confidence.
