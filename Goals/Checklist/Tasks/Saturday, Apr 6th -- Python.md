- [X] The Tiny Contacts program is a useful template for any kind of program that stores data and lets a user work with it. You can even
- [X] add some of the sorting and **data-processing** features from the ice-cream sales program to make applications that not only store data but let you do interesting things with it.
- [X] You could create a music track storage program that lets you search for tracks based on the length of the track.
- [X] The program could suggest tracks that could be combined to fill an exact amount of time or give the total play time of a specific playlist.
- [X] You’d have to create a class that could hold the track information, store the information in a list, and then create some behaviors that would search through and process the data.
- [X] Or, you could make a recipe storage program that stores lists of ingredients and preparation details. Remember that one of the items in a class could be a list of strings, which could be the steps performed to prepare the recipe.
