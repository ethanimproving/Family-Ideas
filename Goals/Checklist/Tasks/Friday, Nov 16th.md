**Work Tasks**

- **Time sheet**
- [X] 6 Hours Coding

I think I'll start using BEM CSS naming convention.
1. Block: stick-man
2. Element: stick-man__head
3. Modifier: stick-man--blue

I haven't been taking as meticulous notes on my learning expenditures since I've been logging my hours in Excel. It may be for the best. Having a structure of tasks in mind is helpful for organizing what I'm doing in a broad sense, but taking note of every little accomplishment along the way takes up too much time. So I'll just have basic checklist agendas and leave the results in the code itself.
