**Greeting**

- (B) Hey, Noah, this is Ethan. We went out soul-winning a couple Sundays ago.
- (A) Hey Noah, this is Ethan. I'm Jasleen's friend. I met you out soul-winning a couple of Sundays ago.

**Small Talk**
**

- Remember? Yeah! How you been? Did you sign up for your classes at Collin yet?
    - Alright.
    - Haha, slacker.
- It’s been really hot lately, hasn’t it? I don’t remember it being this bad last summer.
- I hope you're doing alright.

**Get to the point**

Listen, the reason I'm calling is to see if you're available to hang out this week, maybe knock some more doors. I'm sure you have questions, difficult passages, and I'd like to help answer them, instead of just lobbing this grenade and leaving you to make sense of it yourself.

Do you have work on weekdays? When do you get off work?
