- [X] Learn Output and Routing for Angular
- [X] Walk through Maximillian's MEAN Stack Udemy course

Routing / view rendering is done on the front end with Angular.

Angular is a Single Page Application. Instead of rendering a new html page every time a user navigates through the website, Angular manipulates the DOM to remove / add elements, eliminating wasted computer effort in reloading the page.

Angular's event binding allows us to listen to events in a declarative way, which means instead of programatically using JavaScript where we would go to our code and try to select the element with a query selector or anything like that, and then use add event listener on the element, you can go to your html-based template and add parentheses inside an html tag.

A property is a variable in a class.

Component selectors (Custom HTML tags) need to be imported in the app.module.ts file.

Add output hooks with string interpolation

A service is a class which you add to your Angular application which lets inject by Angular into components, and which is able to centralize some tasks and provide easy access to data within different components without property and event binding.

Dependency Injection

Prevent memory leak (living subscriptions when elements are not part of the DOM)
