I called customer service at 1-800-379-2073 from the phone number provided on this page: https://www.bose.com/en_us/contact_us.html

He asked

- If I got the same error with multiple applications (For me, Teams and Webex)
- If I got the same error on multiple devices (I didn't try)
- If I tried resetting it (holding Bluetooth button for 10 seconds until a blue light turns on).
- If I had updated the firmware (I already had)

He also asked for the date of purchase, and if it was directly from Bose or third party (for me, Amazon).

Then he gave me a custom 9-digit reference number for me to text to the following phone number along with a screenshot of my Amazon purchase. (508) 469-5278

He acknowledged that I had received my product already defective, and as such they will cover the shipping cost for me to send it back to them and get a replacement.

It was very good customer service, super nice guy. I didn't want to be without my headphones while it was being sent back, but it was worth the wait.

Text Message: Warranty Verification Reference Number: ******406

Then he gave me this number to text "Warranty Verification. Reference Number: ******406" (He gave me

I get a prompt that says, "You're microphone isn't working" after 10 min on every call (Teams/Webex)

Warranty Verification: Reference Number 703502406

I will pay the $175 for the new headset if I get to keep my old QC35s.

You're just telling me there's a problem with your product. Don't tell me it wasn't designed for Laptops, there are pictures of a guy on his laptop in the product page. The product description literally says it's designed to connect to up to 2 devices simultaneously, but I'm supposed to believe one of those devices isn't a laptop? That's not going to fly.

I paid $300 for headphones to make voice calls.

Then why does it work for Tim Rayburn? Or Brent Garrison? Or several of my other friends that bought the headset and use it for Teams. Why has nobody been able to fix this in 2 years? That's an embarrassing development team. It's not a hardware issue. If I take the same laptop and go to somebody else's house, it doesn't disconnect.
