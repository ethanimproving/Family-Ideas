I was cheated on twice in 2020, and I tried not to psychoanalyze it, and to be positive, but anytime you're cheated on, you look into the mirror and think, "I would cheat on me too." It makes you feel inadequate as a man when two girls in a row cheat on you. Once it's like, "Maybe it's her own problems. Her own demons." Twice, and you start thinking, "There's a problem with me. There's something wrong with me. I'm not enough for them." It wrecks you. And then you become possessed by the need to be validated by someone, like, "Hey, I improved myself, and now she's not going to cheat on me."
