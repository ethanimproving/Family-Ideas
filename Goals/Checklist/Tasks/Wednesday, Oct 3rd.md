- [ ] Socratic method: how does a person get saved? Why does he need a substitute? What are the conditions that impute that righteousness to us? Is that consistent? Why is faith necessary? A lot more people would have been saved if God said, "You can try and work your way to heaven and I'll still forgive you. Just do your best and I'll take care of what you don't accomplish." Why did God require faith in Jesus? That makes the way very narrow. If you died on a cross to pay for the sins of humanity, surely you want as many people in as possible. Why offer it exclusively to those who trust God's promise of eternal life in Christ Jesus? -- because the opposite is to call God a liar, and when you call God a liar, that's blaspheming the Holy Ghost, and if you blaspheme the Holy Ghost you will not be forgiven (unless you blaspheme out of ignorance, i.e. you haven't been enlightened in the truth yet). The minute you say salvation is obtained partially through your performance of sorrow, through your contriteness of heart, you call God a liar. Don't give the answer. Say, "I'm going to write down for you a 3 verses and see if you can find a connection between them in the context of our question. Come back to me when you have an answer that you're confidant in. ... okay, now look at these 3 additional verses and see if that aligns with how you interpreted thebother 3." Don't dig up the seed to see if it's growing.
