Tomorrow what I want to accomplish has to do with the audio time slider. I already have most of it done, but the remaining tasks include:

- [X]  correct the seekto function to convert the range value into the correct duration time. (7/18/2018 9:31 AM)
- [X]  create a function to indicate the time loaded (7/18/2018 4:01 PM)
- [X]  include a current time indicator trailing behind the thumb handle (7/18/2018 4:02 PM)
- [X]  create time bubble
- [X]  pray for Pastor David Berzins - encouragement, excitement, zeal, faith, and great exploits (7/18/2018 8:35 AM)
- [X] get time elapsed object to retrieve "seekto = myAudio.duration * (seekslider.value / 100);" value to that it updates on click rather than on load (7/19/2018 3:13 PM)
