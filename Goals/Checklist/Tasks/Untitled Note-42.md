When I attempt to connect my Dell monitor to my laptop, the device connect/disconnect sound keeps looping on and off and it never connects. This started happening right after I attempted daisy chaining my left monitor (A) USB type-C out-port (on the side) to my right monitor (B) USB type-C display input (underneath). My laptop only picked up (A) and I abandoned trying to daisy chain them together. Then when I tried plugging (B) back in, my laptop wouldn't pick it up. I had both of them connected without an issue last night, so I know my graphics card supports them.

I can also use (B) with an HDMI cable, but not with (A) at the same time.

I think somehow trying to daisy chain made my HP laptop mess up the drivers for (B), because it still displays (A). After contacting Dell support they have concluded the problem is with either the computer, video card, or video card driver, but not the monitor. So I've contacted HP Support and they've given me two exe files to update the drivers and BIOS. When executing the BIOS update, it prompts me saying, "This device is protected with a BIOS setup password."

What I need is someone to take control of my laptop and input the BIOS password so I can continue with the HP Firmware Update and Recovery.

Is there someway to make my laptop forget about it's history with these monitors and plug it in fresh? Or is it a different issue entirely?

I've spent over an hour on call with Dell support this morning and it was completely useless, just telling me to unplug and replug cables and such. I just purchased these monitors and they only arrived yesterday.

Thanks.
