I'm not going to follow in Todd White's likeness. I'm going to be the first Ethan Miller. And I'm going to make my mom proud of me, if it kills me. Instead of disagreeing with people, I'm going to assume they badly articulated exactly what I believe. "New life in Christ!" "Amen! We are born again! We've been washed by the blood of the lamb, regenerated from the word genes, and now there's nothing we could ever do to be separated from the love of God. To all who received him were given the right to become children of God. And if we walk in the spirit, we're going to do things we never thought we could do."

"Repent from your sins." Amen. Because we love the Lord Jesus Christ, and he said if you love me, keep my commandments. And we praise God almighty for sending his son to be the propitiation for out sins, because we know that no man will be justified by the deeds of the law, and we were powerless to work our way to heaven, so Jesus did the work for us and paid for all our sins, big and small, past and future, on the cross. We are justified not by our cross, but by the cross of Jesus Christ.

That's my way of disagreeing with people. How do you preach to people who already think they're saved? "My heart is to see people all around the world come awake, and encounter Jesus, and make him a reality in their lives, not a motto or a chant of a movement to get behind, but a person that they see and know in the Bible. Because almost everybody I know that says they're a Christian have missed the point, and I missed the point for 8 years, and my goal is to make sure that everybody who knows me gets to hear what took my 21 years and 8 years of searching to find out."

I have a testimony that speaks to the majority of people I have a special burden for. Use my testimony as a way to connect with them, so that they see I care about them. It's not a bad thing if they can tell that I are. Use your story. Use your experience. Use your empathy. Let it produce patience in you, and learn what to say to them. Learn what to say to people, and approach them, not just as you go out, but as you're going out. At wal-mart. At the gas station. At a resturant. People are going to hell and they need to hear about Jesus Christ and him cricified, and the free gift of eternal life bought by a God who loved them so much that he put on flesh, dwelt among us, was tempred at all points yet without sin, got mocked, dispised the shame, enduring the cross for the joy that was set before him to pay for our sins on the cross, so that we can have peace with God, and we enver have to doubt where we're going. So many people think that if they sin too often or too badly they will go to hell, and that's a symptom that they don't understand the gospel. My heart is to explain it to you. Seriously, this changes my life. This changed everything when I understood it. I spent 8 years staring at the Bible trying to figure this out, and it took a preacher from Tempe Arazona to help me understand.

It's perfectly fine to preach from the pulpit against churches that don't go soul-winning, who's candlestick is removed from them, but when you're confronting those people, try to do it with some grace. You're trying to edify them, not strive with them, or treat them like an enemy. And there is a sequence of harshness that corresponds to the amount of knowledge you give them, but it starts out softly and gently, and it's only when they should know better that you begin to reprove them, and only after they don't respond to the knowledge you impart through reproof that you resort to rebuke. Give them patience, give them grace, don't unload everything you know, don't expect them to know everything you know. Imagine you're talking to a spiritual babe in Christ, who don't know any matter, and they need to be taught in baby steps. That's how you're going to affect Northlake and churches like Northlake, is by showing them grace, and patience, and being on the same side. Don't say, "You're not a church! God calls you a social club in Revelation 2!" Say, "Hey man, have you ever thought about going soul-winning? I'd love to take you out some time. Give me your number and maybe we can work something out.

Maybe you were saved before, maybe you weren't. I like to call this the day you knew for sure. You can actually correct them without telling them it's a salvation issue.

I won't to motivate people to get busy for God. This may be the 11th hour of your life, but you can receive the same reward as me if you get out there and start working for God. No Man Hath Hired Me Baptist Church.

Why would it be so bad if everyone who identifies as a Christian were saved, regardless of if they understood the gift of God and eternal security? Because then most people in America would already be saved, who we're knocking on their doors, and we would have to go across seas and maybe learn a language to find somebody to preach to. There's an incentive to say these people aren't saved. But the biggest incentive is because that's what the Bible teaches, and if they die without hearing the gospel and believing it, they will go to hell.
