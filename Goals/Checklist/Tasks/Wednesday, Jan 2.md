- [ ] <s>Consolidate questions for Returning Student Admissions</s>
- Can I keep my old student ID? (Ask Anna)
- How can I apply for re-admission and still keep my student ID?

- My registration status said, "You require re-admission prior to registration."
- I reapplied for admission as a returning student online and got an email that said, "You will receive your Collin College email address and ID number in a separate email within 2 business days."
- When I went to apply, I tried logging in with my cougar account, and it rejected my credentials, so I created an account with my cougarmail.
- When I was first admitted, it would have been on many.millers@verizon.net, but the website said that address didn't have an account.

- I relieved an [email](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/2/#inbox/FMfcgxwBTsgVMTjPwGRDLptgbShrmQjq)Â on January 3rd informing me that my application had been processed and my information remained the same. I don't know how they knew my application corresponded to emiller25 since I didn't provide that information, but I suppose their database is more sophisticated than I imagined. It might have been my driver's licence number, or my street address in conjunction with my name that was already linked to emiller25. I don't know. I'm just surprised they didn't ask for my already-existing account during the application. I'm glad it worked out though.
