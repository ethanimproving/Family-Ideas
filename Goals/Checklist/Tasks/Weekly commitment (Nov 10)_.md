No TV, only sermons.
No worldly music, only hymns.
No strife, only lowliness.
No vain glory, only esteeming others.
No smug jesting, only humility.

If you do these things, you will not stumble.

No TV includes anything with the family. Reject even wholesome shows this week in pursuit of growing in the knowledge of Christ by the edification of the saints.

No worldly music includes appropriate love songs from Chestersee for now. I will allow classical music and limited opera, but not above 10% of the proportion of hymns and psalms and spiritual songs.
