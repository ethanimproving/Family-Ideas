Oh of course.

- How many years of [Asp.Net](http://asp.net/) programming experience do you have?

None.

I haven't worked on any projects using ASP.NET or C#. However, when I was building a Windows application using C++/CLR that interacted with the .NET framework, I used videos and forums on C# using .NET to learn how to do most of tasks I wanted to accomplish because the concepts were similar enough that it carried over. I have full confidence that I could pick it up seamlessly.

1 year.
This includes HTML, CSS, SCSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, and Pug/Jade.

- How many years of Microsoft SQL Server experience do you have?

5 months.

- How many years of Web Services (WCF, ASMX, Web Methods, WebAPI) experience do you have?

~8 months.

I've used [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) for a number of web API projects I've worked on. I've also worked with APIs in Python applications ([IMDbPY](https://pypi.org/project/IMDbPY/)) and Visual Basic in Excel (Google's Di[stance Matrix AP](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/start)I). I'm not familiar with WCF, ASMX, Web Methods, or WebAPI as I haven't worked with ASP.NET.

- How many years of Windows Server experience do you have?

None.

But I'm a quick learner and I've used a Visual Studio Community extension called [Live Share](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/) to collaborate with peers in the past.

because it is so unpopular to use C++ for this kind of application there was not a lot of tutorials / Stack Overflow forms on it, so I  most of the videos I found helpful were actually

the videos and documentation that was most helpful actually came from C# using .NET.
