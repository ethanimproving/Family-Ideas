**Work Tasks**

- **Time sheet**
- [X] 11Â Hours Coding

3 Quarter inch usually goes to a half bath, because the sink doesn't need as much water.

I wouldn't have gone that far down. Sheetrock is easier to repair than bedrock.

It'll still trace. We have a wand. Hopefully it comes over here.

- **Website integration**

- [X] Link resource-header__author span and svg path on hover (trigger hover span when hovering over svg)

```
.resource-header__author ==path:hover== {
fill: #c6000e
}

.resource-header__author==:hover path== {
fill: #c6000e
}
```

If path is the descendant of a element that's being hovered over, apply X styles. Brilliant.
