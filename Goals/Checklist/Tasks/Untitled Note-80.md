**Intro:**

Hi, I'm Ethan Miller, and I'm calling about the estimate for our 2011 Corolla that was recently in an accident. We were told we would be getting $3k to replace the car, and I'm calling because I believe the car was worth a little more than that.

**Reasoning:**

- It always ran reliably,
- I changed the oil myself every 5,000 miles, (Mobil 1 Advanced Engine Oil High Mileage Full Synthetic 5W-30)
- took care of all the maintenance,
- it had a little over 100,000 miles on it,
- the way I was taking care of it, I expected it toÂ last another 15 years at minimum.

To me, 15 years of a reliable vehicle is worth a little more than $3,000.

People have different ways of valuing cars, but the bottom line is that somebody ran out in front of me, and I can't replace my car with the money you're giving me. That's what insurance is for, and I think insurance is great, but I'm going to need a little more money to replace my car. I can't buy another car for the money you're giving me.

**Sneaky Games:**
Is there anything you can do to help me out?
I was wondering if we could go a little higher than that.

**Facts:**
Total Value in 2016: $10,371
We received: $2,314
Mileage: 70k

***Arguments for car value:***

- 15 years of use left
- Comparable cars with accident history are $6k, Kelley Blue Book says my car is worth $5,741
- Cosmetic damages affect my commute
- It ran smoothly, reliably, and never had any problems.

***Arguments for more money:***

- I can't replace my car for $3k
- Insurance exists to insure that if someone wrecks my car, I can get another car.
- Insurance is not a numbers game.
- Insurance turns a crisis into an inconvenience, but if I can't buy another car, we're back to crisis mode.

I feel that 10 years of a reliable vehicle is worth a little more than 3,000. I'm just calling to ask if we could bump it up to 4k?

I feel that the car was a little bit undervalued there.

So if I get in a wreck, and the insurance sees total loss, are they going to give me 10k for it?
