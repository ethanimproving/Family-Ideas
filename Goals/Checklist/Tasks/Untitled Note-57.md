- [ ] Record Pastor Shelley's Rap

If you didn't vote for Biden you ain't black
CNN and Lemon goin'a call you wack
My brothers got major problems for real
But this ditti about to get me a record deal
Black chilcren be dyin' all the time
So pay attention to my little ryme
Parents need to watch their son and daughter
To protect them from that racist water
My brothers keep dying without a chance
Not learning to swim, but break dance
So watch out for that swimmin' poon
Don't pull an Abner and die like a fool
