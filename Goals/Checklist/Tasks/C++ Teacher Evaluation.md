I don't mean to be rude because I think elderly people should be treated with respect, but it's probably more important that an evaluation accurately reflect the professor's competencies.

Not a teacher. More like a book recommendation. He expects us to read the book, so he never actually goes over anything useful in his 2 hour lectures. I, like many other students, never open my book. Maybe it sounds silly to the existing faculty, but professors need to realize that reading is an incredibly inefficient method of learning in this day and age. The reason it requires so much focus and energy is because there's so much useless fluff between the rare nuggets of information that it strains the mind to pay attention. Every now and then I come across a book that has something useful on every page, and in that case, I read it, but I've never found textbooks to exist in that variety. Stop making us read. Teach us something. You have enough time.

You are a bad professor. You expect us to know things that you haven't taught us, and when we ask you for the information so that we can learn, you won't tell us. That's not teaching. It's not helpful, and it's not worth going to college for people like you to give us a task and withhold the instructions we need to know. We're here to LEARN. If we're going to design an application with 12 input fields from Form 1040, we need to know what input fields those are and what order they come in. Because the first 4 you gave us includes Living Arrangement, and that's not even on Form 1040. What am I supposed to do? So I email the professor, and he says, "Figure it out." Really? I've read every document that you've uploaded to this module, and the information isn't there. You're a bad professor. I think it's time to retire if you can't even remember that the information your students need to know for assignments aren't accessible to them, and when they ask you for it directly, you won't give it to them, or direct them to the right place. What are you? Some kind of lazy sloth? You're not a teacher, that's for sure. I could learn more staring at a rock.
