10. Let's talk about exceptions. Tell me what you know about exceptions.
11. There are two kinds of exceptions in Java. What are they?

    - Checked and unchecked

12. Write a try Catch for me

    - What if I'm calling something, it's a block, and there's 3 different exceptions being thrown?

24. Simplimatic Complexity?

Andrew

1. I have a silo full of beans, and I want you to make me a bean counter. I'm going to give it to you one at a time.

2. How can I find out how many Beans I have?

3. Is there anything you can do to simplify it? (This is kind of a bonus question.) There's something that's unnecessarily indirect.

4. I know it's a Bean counter, but I put corn inside of silos too, so I need to count corn too. Maybe like Pecans too.

5. This works great. I told all my friends about it, and they want to use it to count pigs, pecans, everything. It has to count like 40 different things.

6. Unfortunately, one of the beans was infected with typhus, and a 5 year old died. (This is great but, it doesn't work anymore.)

7. What is the problem we created for ourselves? I think you may have an architectural problem that prevents you from doing it this way.

8. It seems that there is something common to all the things that we want to count. We want to know if any of the things we want to count have typhus. Is there a way we can express that commonality? There's functionality they all share.

Jason and Charlie
1. So tell us something about yourself?

    - I've been a member of Team Edge in Ticketing and Receipts for the last 15 months
    - It's been a blast learning a lot from my team members, we have Subject Matter Experts in almost everything and I've enjoyed using them as a resource to learn what they already know.
    - Bootcamp 3 months - holistic, organized approach
    - Self taught for a year - coding scavenger

2. What is it about software engineering that you wanted to be in it?

    - I had ideas of things to build.
    - Build tools when training to be a CADD Technician. Making work more effective in Microstation.

3. How did you come about being to this bootcamp?

    - Brother had connection at his work.
    - Coworker connected me to Braydon Coyher.
    - Braydon landed me an interview at Cognizent.
    - Brayden recommended the bootcamp.

4. How has the bootcamp experience been? What are some of the highs, and what are some things that you would change about it?

    - Didn't expect to be so tight knit with all the bootcampers.
    - Experts in one specific topic to learn from. Access to people who really know there stuff.
    - Something I would change... You put me on the spot a little bit with that question. Sometimes the instructors can talk a little too fast. It takes our brain a minute a process a new vocabulary word they just introduced us to.

5. What will you miss about these folks, and what will they miss about you?

    - I'll miss the jokes, the games we play during lunch, (I've spent 2 lunches not with these people the whole time that I've been here), the trust huddle.
    - I can't say for sure what they would miss about me, but my hope is that they would miss my sense of humor, and my total transparency and willingness to reach out to anybody as soon as we determine we need them.

6. What is some critical feedback you've received, and how have you handled it?

    - Tim has told me, multiple times I'm sorry to say, that my mentorship abilities, I tend to jump in and try to solve somebody's problem for them rather than actually guiding them to find the answer themselves. That's something that I've tried to work on, in those moments to be consious of it, and I think I have gotten better at letting people reason out for themselves what the solution is. It just takes a little bit of patience. But feedback is something that I really appreciate, because the aim of feedback is to make me better. It's for my benefit. It's not for Tim's benefit.

7. How would you describe your personality?

    - Outgoing, I like to have fun, I care about people, sometimes a little bit immature, I'm very competitive.

8. How would other people describe your personality? Is there something you do that other people might find annoying?

    - Because I'm very competitive, little comments that mean nothing to me, but might mean something to someone else.
    - Ever since we got our DISC assessments back, they tease me for being the highest in dominance. But definitely competitive. Everybody knows that I like challenges.

9. Tell us about your most important accomplishments.

    - Dude. Winning souls to the Lord man. I went to a church for 7 months that taught me how to preach the gospel.

10. Tell us about someone who's way better than you in an area that really matters to you.

    - Tim Rayburn is a much better communicator than I am. I really wish that I had his communication skills because being smart is only half the battle. being able to communicate what you are thinking is everything left over. He has no mental laziness.

11. Tell us about a time when you were convinced you were right about something, but then it came up that you changed your mind.

    - Oh man this happened so recently. I said we don't need an interface for a singleton, but we needed it to restrict from other classes to being able to access some of the private methods, and using an interface was helpful for some of those reasons. New information and I changed my mind.

12. What is the hardest you've ever worked on something?

    - Mentally or physically? Pyrotechnico.

13. How do you stay informed about things that you're interested in?

    - Mostly the internet. Social media, Google searches, YouTube. If it's coding related, I might review the documentation, stack overflow.

14. What questions do you have for us?

    - Are there people at American that are willing to come help me with a problem if I had an issue? Could I slack them and they'd be willing to come over?
    - I saw that y'all had a cafeteria down below.
    - How many people are typically on a team?
    - I saw the ping pong tables. Are people able to play those when they're having problems with their going and going, "I need a break?"
    - Alright, well you've exhausted all my curiosity.
    - What's your favorite thing about American Airlines?

Allison

1. Which one of our values stands out to you in particular? What about it connects with you?

2. What about your involvement? How have you tried to live into that value?

3. Tell me about your overall bootcamp experience. If we were to run it again, what should we keep, or what things might we change?

4. What else should I know about you?

Compliments:

1. Based on what you're already saying I love that you're quick to answer, and you're giving me like, "Here's the thing, and here's the why." --- You're going to make me blush. That's what I try to tell my imaginary girlfriend.. Extroverted very generous spirit. The thing about Time is that he's always smiling.
