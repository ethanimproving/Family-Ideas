[Homework 5](file:///A:/Users/Ethan/OneDrive%20for%20Business/Documents/Academic%20Documents/Spring%202019/ITSE%201359%20(Python)/Week%206/HW5.pdf)**: **Using Functions to Simplify Programs ([Chapter 8](file:///A:/Users/Ethan/OneDrive%20for%20Business/Documents/Academic%20Documents/Spring%202019/ITSE%201359%20(Python)/Begin-to-Code-with-Python.pdf))

- **Exercise 1.**
- [X] Make Something Happen (p 221, Read the names of quests for a party).

Lists can hold any type of data that you need to store, including strings. You could

- [X] Change the ice-cream sales program to read and store the **names of guests** for a party or an event you’re planning.
- [X] Make a modified version of the sales program that reads in some guest names and then displays them.
- [X] Make your program handle between 5 and 15 guests.

- **Exercise 2.**
- [X] Make Something Happen (p 234, Sort alphabetically).

The bubble sort algorithm works for strings as well as for integers, and we saw in Chapter 5 that the Python relational operators work between strings.

- [X] Make your party guest program display the guest names for your party **in alphabetical order**. You could use this program any time you want to sort some words into order.
