I just read for 19 minutes from Psalms, and both Caleb and Faith stayed for the whole time. I just started reading because they would not depart, but kept being filled with words until time would have failed me. It was so nice. No Bible study. No opinions and thoughts or questions. Just Bible, and a few emphasises. Today was a good day. Although I might've accomplished more, I must have worked 10 hours. 8 hours and then from 8 to 9:40. I also played with Faith and read and prayed and learned and fulfilled my checklist. I'm refining my evaluation of S3 to see whether I would profit, lose, or cut profits from using it. Except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain who build it; except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.
