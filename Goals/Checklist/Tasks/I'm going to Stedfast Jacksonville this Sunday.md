3 Reasons:
1. New leadership (didn't like Romero's voice)
2. Pastor Logan Robertson's sermon, "You're Not In The New IFB Movement"

3. [Brother Norm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMMWmwlBAaA)'s charge to make the drive to church

All of these events occurred within the span of one week. I think the Lord is telling me that now is the time to move churches. I've been praying to God that I would have the Spirit of Elijah and be a zealous Christian, and this is the arrow God is handing to me to smite the ground with: Stedfast Baptist Church. Am I going to smite it against the ground until there's no more arrow left, or am I going to just, "1, 2, 3," and go home? It's time to be found stedfast, abiding in the work of the Lord.

Things to do to prepare:

- [X] Northlake Hospitality Committee
- [X] Tell my Sunday School class that I went to Stedfast Baptist Church in Fort Worth to support Pastor Jonathan Shelley
- [X] Prepare testimony (Let the redeemed of the Lord say so)
- [X] Gain courage to be baptized (without my family as witnesses -- who is my brother and my mother?)
- [X] Put phone charger in Corolla

<s>- [ ] Permission to use Faith's phone because it's faster</s>

- [X] Permission to drive 1 hour and 15 minutes weekly to Fort Worth (this will be good for overcoming my fear of driving)
- [X] Stay there until the evening service (see about soul-winning / carpooling if it's not local, read Bible / memorize verses in free time)

-

- [X] Emergency money for gas
- [X] Money for lunch
- [X] Case the area to see what's around (food-wise)
- [X] Get plans straight (10 credit hours at Collin College + 30 hours of independent studies + 10 hours of homework, internship in summer, job by August)
- [X] Figure out what they wear (suit or more casual?)
- [X] Decide to get there 15-30 minutes early in order to talk to people there and account for first time confusion
- Service at 10:30 AM, ==leave by 9 AM==, wake up by 8 AM, EAT BREAKFAST
- [X] Decide that I'm going to be social and actually ask, "Is someone sitting here?" rather than choose a secluded spot.
- [X] Prepare gospel presentation for soul-winning
- [X] Choose sermon for car ride
- [X] Pack a change of clothes

It's time for me to start taking my Christian walk seriously, and it's really hard to do that at Sardis. It's hard to do that at a church that's dead, or at a church that's worldly. I need to be in a church that will spur me on towards good works. Not a church that makes me study to defend my position that we should even go soul-winning in the first place. Maybe I do have to give up what I want. Maybe I have to give up seeing Amy every week and my plans of changing my personality so as to make her love me, but if I don't do this, I wasn't going to be transformed enough to make her fall in love with me anyway. It's time I please God instead of my own belly. I'm going to have the faith of Abraham, like when he moved out of his country on faith.

Back when I was unsaved I used to listen to Piper a lot, and he was the one voice that said, "It's faith alone. It's faith alone. Don't you dare add anything to the cross of Jesus. It's not your fruit, it's his blood." And so for me to hear him say things like, "If you don't stop fornicating you will go to hell," is hard for me. He was like an anchor for me that kept me from just killing myself.

It's really been a blessing to be here, and a great privilege. I don't think people really understand how great it is to be with like-minded believers until they've spent years and years in watered-down churches that preach from the NASB, promote friendship evangelism, talk about movies and music in their conversations, lift up Billy Graham and other false prophets. It's just like coming out of a cold, and you've been miserable for a few days, and now you can breathe, and you fee great, and you have a special appreciation for being healthy.
