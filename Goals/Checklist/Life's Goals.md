- [ ] I want to help free young boys from pornography.

This was the biggest cause of distress to me in my teenage years. Their battle isn't in the heated moment of burning passions. Their battle is in the early part of the morning when they read their Bible or don't. When they pray or don't. When they sing or don't. When they build a life that allows them to become a man who a woman will want to marry, and they marry that girl. Focus on those positive changes, because once you have a wife, your pornography problems are over. And until then, strive so hard towards that positive life that you don't have time to look at phonography. You can't live in guilt, shame, and condemnation to achieve victory.

- [ ] I want to [[Amplify Ministries|disciple multitudes of people]].

There's something powerful about the Billy Graham Crusades. It's the sheer number of people that it reached. His eloquence, the effort he put in phrasing things the right way so that people would listen. If a saved believer could learn to put as much effort into a genuine, unique, carefully crafted message, maybe more people could be reached.

But there's already so many sermons that have been beautifully delivered. The world doesn't truly need me to craft another sermon. It needs to discover the sermons that have already been preached, that could never be imitated. I don't want to deliver somebody else's sermon. If I deliver any at all, it will be new. But it won't be new for the sake of just saying something. It will something that they need to hear. And so far I don't have anything to say that isn't a repeat of what I've already heard. So instead, I want to create a sermon Netflix, which as much graphic design, speed, features, simplicity, and accessibility as possible so that people get addicted to hearing the preaching of God's word. I want to create a note-taking system linked to timestamps, and a plugin that integrates them with Obsidian, which I believe is the future of notetaking.

- [ ] I want to strengthen the middle class.
- [ ] I want to inspire people to build [[House Rennovation Ideas|beautiful homes]], and make it accessible to them.
- [ ] I want raise my children to have hearts that are [fully devoted to the Lord](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Chronicles+16%3A9&version=KJV), so they can be the voice that [I'm too dirty to be in the world](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Chronicles+28%3A3-6&version=KJV).

My life's mission is to use every advantage I have to springboard my children towards this goal. So many children are stuck at the lower levels of Maslow's Hierarchy that they don't have time to focus on the higher levels. I need to provide two things to my children:

1. A vision.
2. To take care of their basic needs so that they can focus on the vision.

> "Each decision we make throughout the day takes a toll on our finite amount of mental energy." ~ [[Overthinking|Anne Bogel]]

A clean house will give them focus. A scheduled structure will help them have time management skills. The only reason I care about making the world more efficient is to free us up to do truly important things, and there is no more important ambition that the ambitions we have for God. I spent a year doing Graphic Design for Amplify Ministries. I would still be doing that if I didn't have to work in order to survive. But I will use my spare time to create a Sermon Netflix so that other people can find the treasure to be found in the Bible. And I want my children to build a house for the Lord, metaphorically speaking. I want them to spearhead a movement of righteousness in their generation, to bring people to God, to teach men to call upon the name of the Lord.

- I will take them soulwinning.
- I will make our house open for hospitality to the saints.
- I will lead daily devotions with the family, including Bible reading, singing, prayer, and Bible memory.

These are not all of my goals, I have [[Ethan's Commitments|many]]. But these are my [[Life Plan|life missions]]. You need to know what your mission is in life, and you need to reevaluate them often to make sure you're not committed to a mission that will account your life to nothing. People need to be selfless to have a meaningful life. You can't have purpose without making your purpose involve bettering the lives of other people. And that necessitates you to overcome introverted traits and replace them with the art of persuasive tactics. The hindrance to you effecting the world is not your introversion. It's your laziness in overcoming the negative effects of your introversion. Buy a course, find a coach, prowl YouTube, query ChatGPT, do whatever it takes to gain the social skills it takes to [[Influence|give other people a dream]], a clear goal, and measure those goals.
