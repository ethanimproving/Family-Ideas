# Photoshop File

I actually used GIMP tp develop this logo. The design is saved to [Zazzle](https://www.zazzle.com/java_junkie_and_caffeine_structure_for_coffee_t_shirt-256924234336728910?dz=cb965a96-86c3-474a-a664-eae5aa15ffea), and the GIMP file is directly in the `Documents` directory.

# Development

Imagine a design to put on a T-shirt that incorporates SpringBoot, CamelAPI, RabbitMQ, Reddis Cache, Dynatrace, IBMCloud, Kubernetes, AiOps Moogsoft, Xmatters, JFrog, Git, Maven, and Microservices. 

`<\>` with the American Airlines Logo as the `\` inside a ticket to represent Ticketing. The ticket is white, and the `<\>` is opaque. To the right is says t&r in `Houschka Rounded ExtraBold` font or `Houschka Rounded ExtraBold` or `Freude`.

Or have "Ticketing &1 Receipts" underneath the large logo"

Design a modern and sleek T-Shirt for our Ticketing and Receipts team at American Airlines, also known as T&R or TNR. We use Spring Boot and IBM Cloud. Consider designing a computer. Be sure to call out T&R in the design. Pay attention to kerning and make the font cool. The T-shirt itself should not be in the design. I want to use your design to put on a T-shirt.


The design should be simple and not too crowded. Consider incorporating elements related to our tech stack, which includes Spring Boot, IBM Cloud, Cucumber, and others. We're open to trendy colors such as gray, black, or navy, but feel free to explore other options. We're looking for a design that is cool and makes sense for our team's responsibilities. Pay attention to kerning and avoid basic typography. There are no specific restrictions regarding logo usage or brand identity. Get creative and surprise us with your design!
