(Verse 1)
Yo, it's Peter droppin' verses, gotta heed the call,
In First Peter, Lot was vexed, against wickedness stood tall.
He dwelled among them, righteous, saw their unlawful deeds,
Day to day, he struggled, with their filthy misdeeds.

(Chorus)
*Love not the world, that's the Father's decree,
John said it clear, in First John two, verse fifteen, see?
In a multitude gathered, Jesus dropped the truth,
Beware the Pharisees' leaven, it's hypocrisy's proof.*

(Verse 2)
Now listen up, Baptists, gotta keep it real,
Talking 'bout the hypocrisy, let's peep and feel.
TV in the living room, the bedroom, too,
But what's it bring? Images of what we're against, it's true.

(Chorus)
*Rock and rap, we say no, it's not our sound,
But in the pastor's house, that hardcore rock's around.
Hypocrisy's the game, if it's wrong in the ear,
Why let it in through the TV, making motives unclear?*

(Verse 3)
Immodest clothing, we preach against the trend,
But turn on the TV, see what's around the bend.
Short skirts, low-cut blouses, stirring up the heat,
God's Word ignored, on the screen, takes a seat.

(Chorus)
*Gender-specific clothes, that's our Baptist stand,
But on the screen, it's a whole different brand.
Provocative dressing, against what we believe,
On the TV screen, it's time to perceive.*

(Verse 4)
Sinful heroes, they're on display,
Even in cartoons, they have their say.
Eddie Murphy's voice, in the innocent show,
But in wicked movies, his true colors show.

(Chorus)
*Sports on the screen, heroes far from grace,
Beer ads, cheerleaders, the TV's embrace.
Idolizing whoremongers, drug-users, too,
Our kids learn from the screen, what's false, what's true.*

(Verse 5)
Alternative lifestyles, subtly promoted,
From the beginning, the agenda's been quoted.
"The Andy Griffith Show," a single parent's tale,
Gomer Pile's actor, in real life, sets the trail.

(Chorus)
*"The Odd Couple," living together, not God's plan,
Genesis 2:24, says a different man.
"The Brady Bunch," a rare scenario portrayed,
But it mirrors divorce, in real life, displayed.*

(Outro)
So if we preach against it, let's practice what we preach,
TV's full of hypocrisy, it's within our reach.
Independent Baptists, let's stay true,
Avoid the TV trap, hypocrisy eschew.
