The world is demonizing Christian fundamentalists. We're not talking about obnoxious street preachers, or terrorists, or sings with froward language. These are simply Christians who have a heart for the lost and goes from house to house teaching the gospel. We're invasive, maybe that's true, and we care more about your soul than what people stereotype us as, but YouTube comments are getting increasingly vile against the New IFB movement, a coalition of churches who stand up for the gospel of Jesus Christ, preach hard against sin because they recognize that Jesus didn't just pay a price to get you into heaven, he paid a price to get heaven into you, and if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship with one another, and will not follow the increasing trendy doctrines of ecumenicalism in our world.
