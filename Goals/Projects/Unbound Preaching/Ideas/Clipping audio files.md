In JavaScript I can set the input range slider equal to 3 minutes. That is, I can have a user Define a range that he wants to clip out, say it's the 26-minute mark to the 29-minute mark, and then I can set the slider zero value equal to duration minus plus 26 minutes, and the endÂ value to 29 minutesÂ (+ 26 minutes plus 3 minutes \[29 minutes - 26 minutes.\])
