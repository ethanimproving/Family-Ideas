Make sets of doctrines categorized into libraries, such that ==a user can integrate or import defined libraries of doctrine into their account==, so that when they click the drop-down menu to add a resource to a doctrine, it will add user additions into a previously existing library. That is, maybe FWBC has 14 videos that deal with the subject of Laziness, and a user wants to add another video to it, he can integrate FWBC's existing doctrine (or entire doctrine library) into his account and add his personal user defined videos to that playlist. Any updates by FWBC will be reflected in the user's playlist, but any user changes will not update FWBC playlist. The user's videos will be added between certain keys, and further entries will be ordered appropriately. If there's an array of 14 videos, and a user adds a video between 7 and 8, videos 8-14 are offset by one, now 9-15. If FWBC adds a 15th video, it will be reflected as a 16th video for the user. This will be something line OliveTree's dictionaries or cross references.
