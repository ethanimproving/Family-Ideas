I would certainly like to make an app like Olive Tree but with the capability to import custom notes and books, or at least epubs, and highlight and make notes and watch videos. There should be a difference between books, notebooks, and notes. And let it have the capacity to record your own books with the microphone section my section, and divide the word count by the time it takes to read to follow along.
