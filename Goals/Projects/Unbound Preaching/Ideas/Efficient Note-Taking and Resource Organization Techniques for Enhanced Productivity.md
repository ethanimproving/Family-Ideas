Heading 1: Take notes

Heading 2: Organize useful resources
Save helpful resources to a user-defined structure of categories and subcategories, like evernote. We call them libraries, stacks, notebooks, and pages.

Heading 3: Upload your own content
Learning doesn't only take place by reading and listening. More often than not, writing and teaching helps you learn even more than being on the recieving end of teaching. Write personal articles, record audio files, and record videos and share them with the world. (Or keep them private and use Bible Academy as a place to store your thoughts.)

Feature 1: Highlight your favorite clips and bookmark timestamps in videos.
We get it. You love saving sermons to a playlist, but you want to jump right back to a certain clip. Bible Academy allows you to highlight a specific chunk from the video and save it as a clip to your playlist. You can also bookmark timestamps and create an outline of the sermon. Good luck! (FL studio feel)

Feature 3: The TVDB.
Have a buttload of content you want to upload to Bible Academy? Take our "Uploading Bulk Content" course to become certified in the best practices to gain bulk upload privileges. We don't want you to waste time doing things one-by-one when there's a better method available.

You can only link to existing YouTube videos until you are granted permission to upload videos to the server. Reasons may include controversial videos that are in danger of being banned from YouTube, private videos, etc. You will gain access to the content management system as a content creator. You must petition to graduate from a user to a content creator. (Users can still link to content and upload articles. They simply cannot upload original content without granted privileges.)

Feature 4: Create doctrine courses (Khan Academy).
