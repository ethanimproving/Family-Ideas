Add ability to splice chapters by sections (verses or passages) to mirror reading plans, so that users can listen to their daily allotment of scripture while running or doing other activities. Or record verse by verse or chapter by chapter, and add a highlight and scroll feature so you can follow along the text on any device including a smart TV.

Also make batch upload possible, but with approval petition stating both the reasons for batch submittal to verify it isn't malicious or trolling, and providing a certificate or training to ensure they follow the best procedures for automating metadata (via cmd and excel or Google Sheets).
