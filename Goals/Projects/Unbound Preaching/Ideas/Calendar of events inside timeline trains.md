Create a timeline like Timeglider that can be zoomed in on or clicked to reveal a calendar view of journal entries like Journey. I don't just want a spectrum of broad categories, but I want to trace the notes included in those categories across time to see how it unfolded. Not all notebooks will be temporal or included in the timeline. The user will tick which notebooks to trace in the timeline. Maybe we should have special categories that aren't notebooks, but something else, like "Events," or "Temporally Meaningful Occupations of Time," or "Temporary Goals." (Trains, Timeline Units, Railroad Cars, Railcars) It makes me think of Jordan Peterson's [appreciation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xV4oIqnaxlg&t=56m49s)Â of music. "The mere fact that you can come up with a time frame across which your current activity is meaningless only means that you're capable of playing with meanings across time frames. It doesn't mean anything at all about meanings, as far as I can tell. Is it absolutely obligatory that everything that's meaningful has to be significant in some unimaginable distant future? Why is that the hallmark?"
