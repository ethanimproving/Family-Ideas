**Dictionary**

* * *

- [ ] Have a site index of defined words
- [ ] Toggle on or off word definitions
So that when you click on a word, a tool tip appears above it with its definition.
- [ ] Make sure users can define their own words, and check or uncheck pre-defined words.
- [ ] Handle conflicting definitions
If the same word has multiple definitions, there needs to be distinctions about which camps define it what way. I'm thinking specifically of Calvinists who like to make it their prerogative to define words however they like in order to fit a passage into their theology.
- [ ] Include definition examples with defined words
Have an associative list of examples at the click of an item included in a user's index of terms. I.e. with semantics, WIlliam Lane Craig's debate where he expounds how his opponent is making a semantical claim over and against an ontological claim.

**Media experience**

* * *

When you click theater mode, have the iframe cover the media menu.
- [ ] Mimic Khan Academy's expanding play button, but make it like Read Scripture's "take a deep breathe as you prepare to spend time with God" button.

**Website structure**

* * *

- [ ] Be sure to have a music column.

**Website features**

* * *

- [ ] Maybe have something similar to the Plex activity tab, that ==shows you which devices that have your user is playing==, if the current user chooses to share with family or friend list.
- [ ] "Add Link or Upload Video"
Maybe require a YouTube upload for most users, and then have ==submission requests for people to upload directly== to the site (like Steven Anderson).
Have an event listener retrieving second-by-second user data about where he is in a video, how YouTube ==remembers where a user left off==. If you're signed into Roku, it'll sync the video status to your phone in real time, and you can ==take notes and break it apart and add section markers==.
Make it possible to ==Rapid Entry== video Series like old TVDB. Add Name, Optional Link, automatic numbering, Topic, Tags, Date, Etc.
- [ ] When you click on a verse reference, it opens a re-sizable modal that brings you to the verse in question, and allows you to scroll up and down for context, like OliveTree. KJV Only.
- [ ] Make a Greek interlinear, such that you have a Greek text in front of you, and you can click on any word to either hear it pronounced by a native Greek audio Bible, or see its English definition.
- [ ] Make audio Bibles available that follow a reading plan.
- [ ] Add a feature to rewind 15 seconds, so if you get distracted while listening, you don't have to open the app to seek the right place or go all the way back to the beginning.

**Database organization and feel**

* * *

In courses and playlists, have icons for sermon, video, article, podcast, audio, / whatever other media type (like Khan Academy subway tracks).
- [ ] Adopt / Promote / Affirm doctrine
Maybe have a graduation method where doctrines articulated ("created") by users can be adopted by a church, and work its way up to official categorization based on a certain number of churches adopting it. (Or a denomination adopting it.) There needs to be some organized interplay between doctrines that have already been pin pointed and categorized and then a user's ability to define doctrines that haven't. A list of affirmed doctrines, tweaked doctrines (affirmation with disclaimer note), and custom doctrines.
- [ ] Users affirm doctrines
- [ ] Churches / Organizations Promote or Adopt doctrines
- [ ] Denominations Promote or Adopt doctrines even further
- [ ] There should be a way to ====append== ==doctrines that are mis====categorized==== under a denomination where it doesn't belong, with examples of that denomination teaching against it. Button "This doctrine doesn't belong here? Click to append." Certain things can be locked in response to misuse, and then users need to acquire special permission to edit or modify data.
- [ ] And you should add churches that branch down into little mini doctrines that make up a denomination so you can quickly compare differences between FWBC and SBCJ.  Optional Nurseries, Mandatory Nurseries, Prohibited Nurseries, Homosexual-Pedophile equivalency, Exclusive Parental Child Supervision,
- [ ] Add keywords so that when you search for ecumenicalism, separation results along with non-denom ecumenicalism.
- [ ] "Append" remove from search results. Protoevangelium.

- [ ] Notes will be formatted with date and time in the top left corner, and a link to the time segment where the note refers to.
- [ ] Doctrine branches should be categorized by hierarchical collections of 1\. Doctrine, 2. Arguments, 3. Position.
- [ ] Doctrines should have parent themes, or doctrine collections to which they may belong. Called stacks in Evernote.
- [ ] Have libraries of doctrine defined by users, churches, denominations, and default available for integrating into a user's account (like OliveTree's concordance, dictionaries, and cross references).

- [ ] Each schema entry should have its own metadata attached to it to that defines whether the doctrine is incompatible with saving faith, not damnable but not correct, true, or the user is unsure.

**User interface and experience**

* * *

- [ ] Have open source packages like Atom or browser extensions that allow users to customize and add their user interfaces.
