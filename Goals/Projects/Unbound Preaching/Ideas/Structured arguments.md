Doctrines can be subdivided by arguments. For example, pro-life would be a position, and there would be an array or arguments that support it. Or modern miracles would be a position, and Piper gives 5 arguments in favor of it. So you have generic, unorganized resources, and then you have structured, outlined arguments. Somehow I need to make those compatible. There also should be Some kind of icon or checkbox by certain doctrines in blue, red, it gray to indicate a particular user or church's position on a doctrine, whether they adopt it, are neutral, don't buy it, or think it's damnable.
