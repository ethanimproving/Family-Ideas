The problem with SQL or relational database systems in general is that they are extremely inefficient with Content Management Systems, because your dealing with so many different kinds of data. You have user information, articles, videos, audio podcasts, and they don't have any relationship with each other except insofar as the fields to which they category of theology is concerned. And you you're going to have a lot of empty fields if you use relational database systems.

You're going to have a lot of empty **fields** if you use relational database systems.
You're going to have **a lot** of empty **fields** if you use relational database systems.

Say it like you mean it, and like you're not afraid of contest. You'll raise your pitch on "fields" if you want to sound like you're open and don't know what you're talking about because you're afraid that somebody might call you out on it, and if they do, you don't want to risk being totally wrong, so you leave a little room for, "I acknowledge that my conclusion has counter-arguments that are valid." Problem is that when you don't sound like you believe what you're saying, others are less likely to.
