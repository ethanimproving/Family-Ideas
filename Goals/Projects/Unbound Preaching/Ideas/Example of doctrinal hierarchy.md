Each doctrine has certain properties, for example: 1. Denominational acceptance. Is it commom among denominations, or belong to a certain sect, like calvanism? 2. Importance. Is it necessary to be saved, optional, wrong but neutral, or damnable heresy? 3. Does the user affirm it, reject it, say it's neutral, say it's damnable? 5. Logical implications (tags -- i.e. trinity is logically incompatable with modalism, or would be the counterposition). 6. User / church / denomination definitions

Users can affirm a doctrine and reject certain arguments within that doctrine.

You can't affirm the doctrine without taking a course to understand it first, or taking a shortcut quiz.

Arguments have properties also, such as tags that link to counterarguments, dealing with objections, dialogs, -- sometimes the best way to teach clearly is to address false doctrines that contradict this doctrine. Steven Anderson makes the connection between categories of dirtiness and false doctrines all the time.
