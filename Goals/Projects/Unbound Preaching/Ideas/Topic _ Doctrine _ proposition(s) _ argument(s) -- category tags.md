Their arguments for propositions, and then there are categories for those propositions. A proposition or a position are not necessarily the same thing. A position on a broader Doctrine may include a number of propositions.

What I need to understand is that a Doctrine is not a category. A Doctrine is a teaching. A Doctrine is a position. But it's helpful to have categories above doctrines that split them up. Cessationism is a Doctrine. It's a position. And it belongs to the category of the question of whether or not Miracles are for today. Divine aseity is a characteristic or an attribute of God. It belongs under the category of being. God's characteristics can be separated in two separate categories, and you don't argue for the category, you argue for the propositions within those categories. You don't argue for his characteristic of being, or maybe you do, but you mostly argue for the elements within the category of being, like divine aseity. So it's helpful to have a category between the topic of God's attributes and the proposition of divine aseity. What do I call these categories? And how can I make them optional?

Dead Orthodoxy is the soteriological proposition that justification is contingent upon sanctification. There are two branches of thought within that Orthodoxy, one is predicated on the idea that justification is not fixed, but fluctuates in and out with sanctification, and the other is that justification is fixed, but the way that you judge whether you have or not is by your sanctification. So that you don't lose justification if you aren't being sanctified, but you can judge that you never have been Justified if you're not living a Sanctified life.

Dead Orthodoxy is a proposition that is addressed and answered and the proposition that salvation is by faith alone. So you should add categories to arguments and resources that say it makes an objection to another proposition. That way you can cross reference how different propositions relate to each other. 

So a category and subcategory are just ways of querrying doctrines that posit particular propositions that are underlied by supporting arguments. "Show me the propositions of the doctrine that teaches God's being that are communicable." These are like phantom categories. They don't actually exist, but are just tags that can be used to structure doctrines into memorable categories.

So the topic of soteriology includes doctrines (positions) thay contain various propositions which can be categorized by groups of related thoughts. Eternal security is the doctrine that teaches the singular proposition that Christians can't lose their salvation. Perseverence of the saints posits that you can't lose your salvation, but you also aren't saved if you sin too badly or too often. So it's a separate doctrine from eternal security even though it shares a common proposition. Do eternal security more distinctively includes another positiin that our continuing sin does not affect our salvation. And that is related (or qualified) by the propositions that God will punish sin on this Earth, and reward us for the good that we do, which belong to the topic of Divine Discipline (punishment for sin after being saved, parental correction). ==There are certain connections between doctrines that structure entire systems of thought.== Just like in your brain, it isn't just the neurons, but it's the synapses that connect them. And so each neuron should have a synapse entry. Each doctrinal entry should have a synapse field that connects it to other doctrines. Either doctrines that are built upon it, doctrines that it is built upon, or doctrines that it just somehow related to, or help explain it better.

An article that includes multiple arguments might have hash sections.

The selector element can follow the structure of a microstation key in. First you select the topic, and you can leave it at that if you want to, or you can zoom in further into specificity and selective Doctrine, and after that you can zoom in even further and select a proposition, and if that you could do me an even further and select an argument. And if you don't know what topic it belongs to, you can just skip that and query all of the doctrines, or all of the propositions, or all of the arguments. Or all four at the same time.

Or maybe it's a zoom out backwards instead of having Phantom tags in the middle. That is, topics could belong to topic categories, that Branch further outward.
