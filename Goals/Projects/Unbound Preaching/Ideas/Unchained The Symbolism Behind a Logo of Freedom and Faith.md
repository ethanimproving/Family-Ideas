dg-title: Unchained: The Symbolism Behind a Logo of Freedom and Faith
tags: [website]
---

This logo was developed with many levels of expression. The first thing you notice is a broken chain link on an open Bible. This is meant to reflect "the word of God is not bound." When you're Bible is closed, it's like a chain binding it up. This is what modern censorship has done with many preachers of the Word, just like the prophets of old. They've shut down Steven Anderson's YouTube accounts with over 150K subscribers because they accused him of hate speech. This is the preacher with the most love for the lost in America today, and they shut him down for hate speech. But they will find out that the Word of God is not bound. We're going to open up the Word they tried to close. The chain is the censorship of modern media platforms.

Then the other half is harder to see. It's horizontal lines extruding from the first half of the Bible, and if you look closely you can see that it's the shape of a heart. This is meant to symbolize how when you open up God's word, the Bible reveals his love, and his heart for humanity, but it's not obvious to everyone. Many people will open up the Bible and all they see is a bunch of lines on a page. Others open it up and see God's heart. The reason is because the Bible is a spiritual book, and it takes a spiritual mind to discern it, which the unsaved don't have. So to them, the Bible sounds like hate speech, the way a parent seems hateful to a child when he wants him to eat vegetables and things that will be good for the child.

The shape of the Bible is from the exact logo of Faithful Word Baptist Church. This is because Steven Anderson was the first modern preacher that has been censored for preaching the Bible. This app has its roots in combating the efforts that have been made to silence him specifically, so its logo contains a hidden memorial to honor the church he pastors.

The holes on the inside and the dots on the outside represent the lost people that God's word is reaching for. He has a place for them in the Lambs book of life, and his children are reaching out to them through the preaching of God's word, but they still have to accept it to be saved.

There are five spots and 8 dots. This is to signify that Christ died for everyone, he offers salvation to everyone, but there are those who have rejected Christ and had their names already blotted out from the Lamb's book. There is no place for them in the Lamb's book, even though the offer still extends to them, because God has blinded their eyes making it impossible for them to believe.

The chain is broken. That's because when we open God's word, they can never censor it. And because this site welcomes other perspectives, including false doctrines. We are open to publications. We believe the way to silence lies is by answering them, not ignoring them. We want to engage with the best version of the arguments, and encourage them to be published here. The truth fears no investigation.

The largest dot is on the bottom. That's because in order to be great in the Kingdom of Heaven, you must be servant of all.
