Some ideas are dependent on other ideas. The more ideas that are dependent on a given idea, the more fundamental that idea is.

Idea: in the sermon Netflix, create a dependency tree (like the Maven dependency tree in IntelliJ) that shows a hierarchy of doctrines tracing back to the fundamental doctrines they rely on. Any doctrine may be dependent on 100 doctrines before that one, and if you donâ€™t believe the fundamental ideas, this one breaks down.

Hebrew 5:12-14
For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat. For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe. But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.
