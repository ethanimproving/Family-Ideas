I want a Kanban board to autogenerate chores based on the schedule defined in [[Title 7 - Chores|Title 7]] of the Miller Code.    

# Requirements
1. Each week tasks will be populated automatically.
2. They will be assigned voluntarily, and users can move from defined, to in progress, to complete.
3. Any tasks incomplete from the previous week will be carried over into the new week.
4. This should be accessible on mobile, without a dependency on Obsidian git interactions, meaning it has to be a separate app.
5. The app should be accessible from Samsung Smart Fridge.
