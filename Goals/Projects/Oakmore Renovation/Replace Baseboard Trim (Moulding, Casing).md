# Trends

Two main baseboard moulding trends are gaining popularity in 2024:

Colonial baseboards
**1. Blending Modern and Colonial Styles:** This trend combines the clean lines of modern design with the intricate details of traditional styles. It achieves a unique and personal touch.
- **Colonial baseboards:** These have more lines and grooves compared to modern baseboards, creating a more visually engaging look. They can be paired with contemporary furniture and colors for a striking contrast.

**2. Contemporary Baseboards:** These are characterized by sleek lines, minimal profiles, and simple designs. They are ideal for creating a clean and uncluttered look in modern spaces.

- **Stepped profiles:** These baseboards have multiple levels or steps, adding a touch of visual interest without being overly busy.

Simple angle baseboards

Ultimately, the best baseboard style for your home depends on your personal taste and the overall style of your space. Consider the size and layout of the room, the existing architectural details, and your furniture choices when making your selection.
