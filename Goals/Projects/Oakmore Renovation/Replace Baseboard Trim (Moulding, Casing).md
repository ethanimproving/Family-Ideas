# Trends

Two main baseboard moulding trends are gaining popularity in 2024:

Colonial baseboards
**1. Blending Modern and Colonial Styles:** This trend combines the clean lines of modern design with the intricate details of traditional styles. It achieves a unique and personal touch.
- **Colonial baseboards:** These have more lines and grooves compared to modern baseboards, creating a more visually engaging look. They can be paired with contemporary furniture and colors for a striking contrast.
