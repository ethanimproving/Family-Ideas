## Air vs. Battery

[I bought the Dewalt Cordless Brad Nailer. I didn't expect THIS.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPV0yf9D92s)

Unless you use a brad nailer more than once a month, the cost isn't justified. You can use the air compressor for a dozen other things, including a tornador. Get a brad (or finishing) and a framing nail gun.
