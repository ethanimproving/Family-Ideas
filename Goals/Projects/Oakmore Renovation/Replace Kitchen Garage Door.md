## Air vs. Battery

[Battery Or Air Brad Nailer Which Is Better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDBHMHkU7is)

[I bought the Dewalt Cordless Brad Nailer. I didn't expect THIS.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPV0yf9D92s)

Unless you use a brad nailer more than once a month, the cost isn't justified. You can use the air compressor for a dozen other things, including a tornador. Get a brad (or finishing) and a framing nail gun.

Air Nailers make more consistent nails.

## Brad Nailer vs. Finish Nailer

[Brad Nailer vs. Finish Nailer: Which is Better for You?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioGToAPsAUI)

Brad nailers are used to hold in place while glue sets.

Brad Nailers: 5/8 - 2.5 inches long
Finish Nailers: 14-16 gauge nails, 1-1.25 inches long
