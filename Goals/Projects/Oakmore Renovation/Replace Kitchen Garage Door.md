# Nail Gun

[9 Types of Nail Guns and How to Choose](https://www.thespruce.com/types-of-nail-guns-6543801)

Fence: Framing Nail Gun
Trim: Finish Nail Gun or Brad Nailer

[Dewalt from Home Depot](https://www.homedepot.com/b/DEWALT/N-5yc1vZ4j2/Ntk-elasticplus/Ntt-nail%2Bgun?NCNI-5&sortby=bestmatch&sortorder=none)

Use cases:
1. Baseboard / door framing
2. Fence
3. Drywall

## Air vs. Battery

[Battery Or Air Brad Nailer Which Is Better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDBHMHkU7is)

[I bought the Dewalt Cordless Brad Nailer. I didn't expect THIS.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPV0yf9D92s)

Unless you use a brad nailer more than once a month, the cost isn't justified. You can use the air compressor for a dozen other things, including a tornador. Get a brad (or finishing) and a framing nail gun.


[Air VS Cordless Nailers Showdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArMal5wiD7A)

Air Nailers make more consistent nails.

## Brad Nailer vs. Finish Nailer

[Brad Nailer vs. Finish Nailer: Which is Better for You?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioGToAPsAUI)

Brad nailers are used to hold in place while glue sets.

Brad Nailers: 18 gauge 5/8 - 2.5 inches long
Finish Nailers: 14-16 gauge nails, 1-1.25 inches long
