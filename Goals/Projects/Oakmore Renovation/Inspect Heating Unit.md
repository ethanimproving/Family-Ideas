Today while I visited Oakmore after work I noticed the thermostat reported indoor temperatures at 62F while it was 23F outside. Caleb's and Anna's houses were at at 68F, a 6 degree difference.

It could be one of 3 problems.

# Thermostat

It might be a problem with the thermostat. However the sensor was accurately reflecting the temperature, so it's unlikely it would be an issue setting the temperature correctly.

# Insulation 

# Heater 

Possible culprits include a (1) malfunctioning heating element, (2) a clogged filter, or (3) issues with the blower motor. It's best to have a professional HVAC technician inspect and troubleshoot the heating system for a precise diagnosis.
