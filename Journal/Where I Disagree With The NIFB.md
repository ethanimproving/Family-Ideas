1. I have no problem with the name Yeshua (Hebrew pronunciation of Joshua)
2. I think the rest if the dead in Revelation 20 are all unsaved, because it says they were judged by their works in chapter 21.
3. I think if you listen to John Piper, he has the right gospel.
4. I think [[I think William Lane Craig Is Saved|William Lane Craig is saved]], even though his version of eternal security is that God kills apostates before they apostasize, logically meaning something we could do could cause us to lose salvation in theory. But he is clear that he rejects catholicism because they say God produces meritorious works in our lives. That makes him inconsistent with logic, not a works salvationist.
5. I think followup and Discipleship is biblical.
