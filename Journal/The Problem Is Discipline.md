Making a beautiful app to track your habits isn't going to help you build habits. Discipline is. I have made the mistake of looking far and wide for the best checklist app, schedule app,  Bible apps, reading plans, note taking apps, and at the end of the day none of that helped in any measurable way to accomplish my goals. Because I'm focused on the wrong thing. I'm focused on the outward appearance, and the skin, rather than the substance of the issue. Even when I had the best checklist app on Android, I ended up ignoring it most days. That will probably happen again if I spend a lot of time to build another one.

> [!Bible] [Matthew 25:7-9 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/matthew+25:7-9?translation=kjv)
> 7. Then all those virgins arose, ==and trimmed their lamps==.
> 8. And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.
> 9. But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.

Why are you spending time trimming your lamp when there's no oil in it, foolish virgin? Why are you spending time making plugins and apps when you don't have discipline, Ethan? ==A beautiful exterior isn't going to fix the internal problem==. If you want to watch sermons, you will watch sermons without a nice app. You will do the work to find them and send them to Mariana. You don't need a Sermon Netflix to track which ones you've already seen. Your problem is discipline, not the app.

You don't need a habit tracker to read your Bible, pray, sing, memorize scripture, and do NoFap. Your problem is discipline, not the app.
