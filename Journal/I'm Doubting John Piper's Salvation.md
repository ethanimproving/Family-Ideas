The other day I defended John Piper to Faith, and then on the morning of Oct 19 I listened to an episode of Light + Truth called "[Everyday Gospel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go8IHi3BsoQ)" where John Piper said some heretical things. 

# God produces meritorious works in our lives

> "It's the power to save believers. How? Verse 17 answers: now because in the gospel, the righteousness of God is revealed, from faith to faith. The good news is that ==the righteousness that God demands from us, He gives to us freely,== for faith." ~ [John Piper](https://youtu.be/Go8IHi3BsoQ?si=fa5wVvXsKAR9nPQl&t=648)

In this quote John Piper is indicating the Catholic idea that it is by works that the Holy Spirit produce in our lives that we merit salvation, and it isn't counted as our works because it's the work of the Holy Spirit in our lives. It's a clever way to get out of the contradiction of scripturas that say salvation is by faith, not of works, but not an honest way. I'm surprised to hear John Piper saying this, especially since in other sermons he said your post-Christian Holy Spirit wrought efforts don't get you into heaven. Why is John Piper speaking two contradictory things? Again if there is any clearance to give him the benefit of the doubt, I want to give it because I have enjoyed so much of his podcast and sermons throughout the years. I don't want to think that he is unsaved, but I can neither let these words hang in the air without holding him accountable for them. I must investigate.

# Being saved isn't enough to get to heaven

> There's not a person in this room who doesn't feel guilty almost daily. I do. And if you say, "You're supposed to believe the gospel", I say. Every day, I have to fight to believe the gospel. That's the point. ==Believing the gospel when I was six, I do believe saved me. You think the battle is over to get to heaven? The battle's not over.== I wake up every morning feeling dirty. My view of God's holiness and righteousness is so high and so awesome that I regularly feel unworthy before Him. Therefore, I must re-appropriate the gospel of a reckoned righteousness to John Piper every day and subdue my guilt with real God-given righteousness. Mine will never, ever do.

# Imputed righteousness makes you live righteously

> In the first half of the verse, it's the righteousness of God. And in the second half of the verse, it's a righteous person. In his mind, when he said the gospel reveals the righteousness of God, he means ==the gospel makes plain that righteousness is imputed to us, such that we are righteous==. So that when he says 'as' and then he says the righteous man, there's no difference. That's what I'm talking about. ==I'm talking about a righteousness that makes people righteous==.


Which is odd because elsewhere Piper says "What is the righteousness in Romans 5:21?? Our lived out righteousness or Christ's righteousness imputed to us on the cross?" And he answers that it's imputed righteousness.

# To get into heaven, faith must bear the fruit of love

My friend Jorge sent me this transcript of a speech John Paper gave called, "[How Do You Get into Heaven](https://www.desiringgod.org/messages/faith-alone/excerpts/how-do-you-get-into-heaven)?"

> How do you get into heaven? ==You don’t get into heaven by faith alone==. You get justified by faith alone. You get into a position where God is one hundred percent for you by faith alone. And ==in order to get into heaven, that faith must bear the fruit of love. Pursue the holiness without which you will not see the Lord. Put to death the deeds of the body, and you will live!==

> We should not speak of getting into heaven at the last day, through the last judgment — when all of our lives are assessed for whether there’s been any transformation confirming the reality of the faith which alone justifies. ==We should not say you can live like the devil and get to heaven. You can’t.==

> There is a holiness without which we will not see the Lord ([Hebrews 12:14](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Heb%2012.14)). ==Essential to the Christian life and necessary for final salvation is the killing of sin== ([Romans 8:13](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Rom%208.13)) and the pursuit of holiness ([Hebrews 12:14](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Heb%2012.14)) — mortification of sin and sanctification in holiness. And what makes that possible and pleasing to God? These next two sentences are absolutely crucial for you living the Christian life in a way that pleases the Lord. What makes it possible for you to kill sin and pursue holiness — which are essential for going to heaven?

> We put sin to death and we pursue holiness from a justified position where God is _already_ one hundred percent for us by faith alone. You are in that position where God is one hundred percent for you by faith alone, and ==from that position, you now put sins to death and you now pursue holiness from that position==.

This is very much like the Catholic teaching that through faith we receive the Holy Ghost which *empowers* us to do good works that *merit* salvation.
