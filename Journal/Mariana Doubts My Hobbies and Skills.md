Mariana consistently says she doesn’t think I will achieve [[Hobbies And Skills To Learn|the hobbies]] I want. If she has to be one of the people on the other side that didn’t believe in me, fine, let it be. I’ll prove her wrong just like everybody else. I’ve always climbed higher than anybody expected. I’ve always triumphed when people didn’t believe in me. And it’s God who sets my feet upon high places. Let them all doubt. I don’t need anyone. I’ll succeed alone. And when I bask in my achievements, I’ll have no glory to share with anyone who supported me.

She said today that she doesn't believe I will achieve my hobbies because the renovations will take away my time. My dear, the renovations are one of the tasks on my list. That contributes to the skills I want to learn, not distract from it. And next year I will choose another. These are not hobbies to overlap. They are a roadmap of the things I want to learn in my free time when most people scroll through their phones and sit on the couch or watch TV. ==I want my life to consist of action. I want activity to free me from the prison of boredom and fatness==. Being comfortable is a gift, but overmuch comfort is sluggardly miserable. I want health, and I want wisdom.

She said she can't take me seriously without a certificate in nutrition. My dear, college does not make facts true or false, it is merely an outdated framework for uncovering them.
