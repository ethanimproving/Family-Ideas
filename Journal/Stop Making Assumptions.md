The other day we were driving in the car and I saw white and blue flags on a car, and I said, "Speaking of [[Wars#Israeli-Palestinian War|Israel...]]" And as we moved passed it I realized, "Oh, those are Cowboys flags." Mariana said, "See? You make assumptions."

After some thought I agreed with her that it's not a good practice to make judgments or say things when you're only 5% sure of its validity. It imposed into my mind the remembrance of how annoying it was when [[Things I dislike about Bibhor|Bibhor would act]] without knowing what to do.

I think it harms the credibility of a person's words when he is accustomed to making brash assumptions, jumping to conclusions with a small degree of certainty. Or, a man who possesses internal certainty with a small degree of support for his certainty.

Does this undermine faith? Think on it.
