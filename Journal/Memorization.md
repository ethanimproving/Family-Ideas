I am at a crossroads now, not knowing weather I should devote my time to reading, thinking, and solving Leetcode problems, or quickly finding the solutions and memorizing the patterns. It would be better for me if I could sharpen my critical thinking skills, and logically think through the solutions.

It is principally a waste of time for me to devote my mental capacity to 1 problem when it and 10 others have already been solved, and I can take a shortcut to learn it in a shorter time frame. But is this robbing my mind of the resistance training necessary to build its mental strength? Yes. But does the mind work like a muscle, or does it work like a database? I suppose the answer is both.

I know what my strengths are: memorization. I've done it constantly as a child being homeschooled with access to the answer keys. Why go through the trouble of arriving at the solution all by yourself when you can simply learn from somebody else who went through that trouble? Why invent the car from scratch when you can learn how Karl Benz invented the internal combustion engine and stand on the shoulders of giants? It's an utter waste of the work of those who precede us. My mind has been faced with challenges in the real world. There's enough real problems to be solved without making up nonsense problems to serve as exercises to the brain.

To be educated is training the mind to think. Yet it is by providing the best frameworks already thought of by our predecessors. We would not have Steven Hawking if Einstein did not come before him. And now, we would not have Ethan Miller if ChatGPT was not his aid in learning algorithms. I will be an educated man by learning the algorithmic patterns in a structured manner laid out by Blind 75. I won't waste my time thinking through the problems. I will become familiar with all the problem-solving patterns and analyze them until I know so many that it becomes blatantly obvious which patterns to apply in any given circumstance, and which nuances to add.

# Brain Functions

1. **Critical Thinking and Problem Solving**:
    
    - **Prefrontal Cortex**: This region, particularly the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, is heavily involved in executive functions such as ==reasoning, planning, decision-making, and problem-solving==. It helps in evaluating and analyzing information, generating potential solutions, and making strategic decisions.![](https://www.scilifelab.se/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/AdobeStock_51054222_brain_prefrontal_cortex.jpg)
    - **Frontal and Parietal Lobes**: These areas are involved in ==processing and integrating sensory information, spatial reasoning, attention, and working memory==, all of which are crucial for problem-solving tasks.![](https://media.istockphoto.com/id/136557249/photo/parietal-lobe-human-brain-in-x-ray-view.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=MHUAxlN6RjZdQpx8YcItJoP9H8Gvh0_C-BMlS0C13as=)

2. **Memorization and Retrieval**:
    
    - **Hippocampus**: The hippocampus is a key structure for the formation and consolidation of new memories, particularly declarative memories (facts and events). It plays a critical role in encoding and ==storing information temporarily==, before it is transferred to long-term memory. ![](https://d2jx2rerrg6sh3.cloudfront.net/image-handler/picture/2019/8/shutterstock_1292650672.jpg)
    - **Temporal Lobes**: Along with the hippocampus, the temporal lobes are involved in the ==storage and retrieval of memories==, including semantic memories (general knowledge) and episodic memories (personal experiences). ![](https://t3.ftcdn.net/jpg/06/68/77/60/360_F_668776077_KZcqKgHm0yJaHUUfJ4TKXJfcC8QBeZgS.jpg)
    - **Prefrontal Cortex**: While often associated with executive functions, the prefrontal cortex also plays a role in ==memory retrieval== by facilitating access to stored information and coordinating retrieval processes.![](https://www.scilifelab.se/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/AdobeStock_51054222_brain_prefrontal_cortex.jpg)

# Don't Figure It Out Yourself

[The LeetCode Fallacy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V7yPrxJ8Ck) claims you are not supposed to figure out the solutions yourself. The exam is  intentionally designed to be so difficult the only way to pass is to cheat.

We learn teach math formulas in schools. We don't ask the kids to discover them by thinking through the problems.

## Memorization

- DFS
- Binary Search
- Sliding Window

## Problem Solving

Problem solving is all about pattern recognition. The more patterns you have memorized, the easier it will be to apply them to new situations.

# Learning Styles

>"I'm trying to determine if my time studying algorithms would be better spent looking at other people's solutions on Leetcode and memorizing the patterns top-down, or spending the time to solve the problem myself bottom-up in hopes that it will strengthen my problem-solving abilities for future patterns that I didn't memorize. I can probably understand 6 problems and solutions on Leetcode in the time it would take me to think through only 1 by myself. To me, that is a better use of time, but I would like your opinion." ~ Ethan Miller

Your approach to studying algorithms on platforms like LeetCode depends on your learning style, goals, and the level of proficiency you aim to achieve. Both methods—studying others' solutions and practicing problem-solving independently—have their merits, and a balanced approach may be the most beneficial.

Here are some considerations to help you decide:

1. **Understanding Concepts vs. Applying Patterns**:
    
    - Studying others' solutions can provide valuable insights into common patterns, algorithms, and techniques used to solve problems efficiently. It helps you understand different approaches and solutions.
    - Solving problems independently allows you to develop a deeper understanding of algorithms and problem-solving strategies. It strengthens your analytical skills, creativity, and ability to adapt to new and unfamiliar problems.
2. **Efficiency vs. Mastery**:
    
    - Reviewing multiple solutions on LeetCode can be time-efficient, especially when you're exposed to various problem types and solution approaches in a short time.
    - Solving problems independently may take longer initially, but it promotes a deeper understanding and mastery of concepts. It helps build a solid foundation for tackling a wide range of problems, including those you haven't encountered before.
3. **Long-Term Growth vs. Short-Term Results**:
    
    - Memorizing patterns and solutions may yield quick results in the short term, especially for interviews or competitive programming contests where time is limited.
    - Investing time in problem-solving independently can lead to more sustainable long-term growth. It enhances your problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and ability to tackle novel challenges effectively.
4. **Balanced Approach**:
    
    - Consider adopting a balanced approach that combines both methods. Spend some time studying others' solutions to understand common patterns and techniques, but also allocate time for independent problem-solving to reinforce concepts and develop your problem-solving skills.
    - Focus on understanding the underlying principles and reasoning behind each solution, rather than just memorizing code snippets or algorithms.

Ultimately, the most effective approach depends on your learning preferences, goals, and available time. Experiment with different methods, reflect on your progress, and adapt your study strategy accordingly. Remember that consistency, deliberate practice, and continuous learning are key factors in mastering algorithms and problem-solving skills over time.
