I was fired at American airlines for stepping out of line in private chats. An investigation was launched into me because of hidden Easter Egg's I left in the code, innocent and harmless enough. But that opened a door into my private chats, and I knew as soon as I heard that I was doomed.

Being fired wasn't the worst part of that experience. Being in a room with Stacey having to explain every negative thing I've said was the worst part. I've never been more uncomfortable then when I had to give an account for every joke, every opinion, and every mistake I've made at work. It made me glad I will escape the judgment seat of God by the blood of Jesus. I have a newfound understanding of how uncomfortable it will be for those who will be condemned in their sins by the Lord.
