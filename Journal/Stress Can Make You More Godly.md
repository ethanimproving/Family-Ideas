A man should have a certain amount of stress in his life, where he works hard and lays everything on the line but can't control the outcome, because it will force him to remember that his success is determined by God, not how hard he works.

What was my reaction to day when I saw this email that I wasn't expecting?

I grabbed my own arm, symbolizing the flesh, and explained like a Scottish warrior, "I will fight!" When you know that you are unworthy, and you fear God, and you are expecting your endeavors to fail because you've sinned to the point where God surely is pitted against you in proper judgment, and God delivers you, the only emotion available is unexpected deep gratitude. It was like a weight that lifted off of me.

For the last 3 days I've been crunching numbers, writing emails, making phone calls trying to decide what to do because nbkc Bank wouldn't give the financing for the house with bare concrete in 3 rooms and the living room. They would require me to put $4,500 into an Escrow account and place a time restriction on when I have to install the floors, which would put huge **time pressure** on my prerequisite projects. Alternatively, Cardinal Financial said they could give the loan without the floor installation requirement, but that option would be $3,000 **more expensive**. So I was caught between a rock and a hard place, and this morning I received the following email.
