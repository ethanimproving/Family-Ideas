Someone made me realize recently that I come across as purely rational and heartless, without feeling. God has shown me over the years how that strives against the grain of scripture, and I've vowed to myself that I would walk in his Spirit which is in me. What that looks like is hard to tell. Maybe it looks like Ephesians 4. Maybe it looks like Galatians 5. For me, right now it looked like writing a letter, so this is my start.

This is a goal that means more to be than any price, any career, or anything on earth. Next time I say any froward thing, any unwholesome thing, clothed not in grace, and I get called out for it, and I begin activating my inner lawyer, and getting in defence mode, and conjuring up scriptures to defend myself, say to me, "Ethan, Ethan. Let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt." And I vow to you that I will pause to listen. I predict that I will be offset by that question, saying, "There are times of rebuke." Say back to me, "Minister grace to them that hear." Write them a letter. Don't curse the deaf. Don't ridicule people to other people. There is a time for anger, and I will not vow to keep myself always from it. But I do vow that if it is not for one of these causes, I will persecute myself: sin, reprobation, false doctrine.
