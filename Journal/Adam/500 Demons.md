Adam, I hope this wasn't out of line, but when I couldn't talk yesterday, I let my mom read your message herself, and she spoke about you to one of her doctors during an appointment she had. I don't know if you're familiar with [[Applied Kinesiology|applied kinesiology]] and muscle testing, but Dr. Van Liew tested you from afar and found 3 curses. More than that, he discovered 500 demons that are not possessing you, but are following you around, which may well be influencing your mental struggles. Dr. Fred said that 500 demons is like a badge of honor, because it means Satan is looking at you and saying, "This kid is capable of a lot of good." There is a spiritual fight around you, Adam. 500 demons is off the scale. The rulers of the darkness of this world are encamped around you, trying to keep you from something.

I asked my mom if Fred knows a way to get rid of the demons and remove the curses, and he does, but you're going to have to want it for yourself, or else the demons will come back with even more, like in Matthew 12:45. I told her you don't have any money, and she told me he would do it for her. I'm not going to suggest one thing or another, but this may be a path to freedom from years of demonic oppression.

She also mentioned your smoking addiction, and Dr. Fred said if you are interested in giving it up, you have to make a pact with yourself that every time you smoke, first drink a glass of water and put a drop of trace minerals in it. He said you can smoke as much as you want, but every single time you do it, drink the water with the minerals first, and your smoking will space further and further apart until in a month you will no longer be smoking.

None of this matters if you die and go to hell. If you ever want to know how to go to heaven, I'd be happy to tell you. I spent 8 years searching for the answer, purousing through the Bible, and it took an angry pastor from Tempe, Arizona to show me the gospel. This too is something that you need to want for yourself. Whenever you're ready, I'll tell you everything.

The spiritual world is real, 

Sleeping disorders have been known to be the result of demonic attack ([Religious Abuse Across Denominations | with Steven Bancarz | CT 038](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAYLneJWI10&t=12m19s)). 

If you want freedom,

Negative astral entities ([Aliens, Demons, & the New Age Movement w Steven Bancarz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6rwILUWKz4&t=11m59s))

He could have been a spirit guide, he could have been just some entity living in the astral realm, he could have been a native American Spirit, 

If you don't find the power of God, you're going to die.

If you go to a book story and go to the New Age section, a lot of the material that you'll see there is what's called channeled material; it's actually given by these entities. So people go into a trance-like state of consciousness, they reach out to what they believe are aliens or spirit guides, then they're writing things down as this information is coming through, literally the doctrines of demons from 1 Timothy 4:1, and all of the channeled material is oriented away from Christ. They're going out of their way to tell you how to understand Christ, what the church got wrong, what early Christianity got wrong, and that was always a red flag for me. Why are they always obsessed with explaining away Christian fundamentalism? 

Christianity has become stripped of the supernatural, all cessationist, the gifts are done, demons might be real but we just don't really think about that or talk about that. 

Where do your memories live when your brain rots? There is something transcendent that we have the ability to tap into through muscle testing.

You and I both know the spiritual world is real, so I'm going to but to the chase.

but it is a technique used to tap into the the extreme intelligence of the body and ask questions that would seem to transcend

Adam, there are things about your inner struggles that you may not understand. Our mental states are not divorced from spiritual influences.

Sometimes bad things happen to people and they get depressed for a little while, but after a few days they get better. Sometimes the bad news is stronger, and a person may experience depression for a few weeks or even a number of months. Egypt grieved 90 days for Jacob when he died. 

Depression sucks because everything is exhausting. It's exhausting to do stuff, it's exhausting to think stuff.

People don't get depressed and stay depressed for no reason. There are spiritual forces you don't understand holding you down. 

Clinicians have observed that 

We feel lousy, we feel withdrawn, we feel a sense of grief, we don't take much pleasure in things, and then we get better. ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOAgplgTxfc&t=9m28s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOAgplgTxfc&t=9m28s)). We cope. We heal. We deal with things in life. What's the deal with you that you can't do that? And there's this lurking sense given that all of us have periods of being depressed and come out the other end, when you look at people who instead go down and stay down there to this crippling extent, there's always this little voice between the lines there of, "Come on, pull yourself together. We all deal with this sort of thing." Depression is as real of a biological disorder as is juvenile diabetes. Part of what makes that clear are a bunch of symptoms called vegetative symptoms. The bodies of major depressives work differently. 

1. They have trouble sleeping (usually it's waking up early, not tossing and turning trying to get to sleep).
    
2. They're sleeping patterns are completely disordered from the 90 minute sleep cycles that our bodies are wired for.
    
3. Decreased apatite. Usually if you're bummed out about something you eat more, because the body knows that carbohydrates decrease stress hormone release. But that's not what you see with MDD.
    
4. Over activity of the stress response.
    
5. Rhythmic patterns of depression
    

Negative astral entities are tied to the irregularities that scientists observe in the brain chemistry of major depressives. 

norepinephrine.

I'm not going to pretend that I understand what you've been through and what you're dealing with. I was depressed for 8 years, and I was the guy who never had a reason to be. I would wake up and my heart just wanted to cry, and I would have no idea why. My best explanation was guilt, shame, fear of going to hell. I felt God's anger against me. I tried to live for him, and I always felt that I was testing his patience and letting him down. Failing, repenting, failing again. "This time I mean it, God." So there was a sense of worthlessness, I guess, but there really wasn't anything wrong in my life. I've had everything I needed since I was born. I've never spent one day hungry. I've never spent one night cold. And the fact that I was so withdrawn made me even more depressed because I didn't feel like I had the right to be depressed.

The Bible says The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear? There was nothing in my health that was suffering, nothing in my world that was lacking. It was the inner battle that I struggled with everyday. I remember having speeches to prepare for and staying up late, and pushing myself to motivate myself to finish it was exhausting. All I wanted to do was sit down and write about how I felt, but I couldn't. Or maybe I just wanted to sleep, but I couldn't. And it was hard to keep going. It was hard to put on charisma like a pair of pants, and put on friendliness, and trick people into thinking I was happy. But there's no other choice. We have to do these things if we want people to like us. To the plus side, sometimes when you're pretending to be happy, you forget for a moment that you actually aren't, and it's a nice break from the drama.

I don't know if I had any demons following me, I don't know if I was clinically depressed. What I do know is that whatever I was feeling for 8 years sucked. 

I finally got saved a year and a half ago. I finally have peace with God. 

It's easy to think of depression as an immutable disease that's determined largely by the serotonin regulators in your brain,

I know that depressed people's number 1 goal is to hide their depression. I think it's because we don't want people to give us sympathy or treat us like a project. We still want to be the strong alpha male that isn't so sensitive or whatever, and we don't want people to think of us as in need of their tenderness. I think that was true of me, anyway. I don't know that I was ever clinically depressed. I pretty much avoid doctors as much as possible. But I woke up every morning wanting to die for 8 years. I couldn't live because my life was a living hell, and I couldn't die because I would go to hell.

Naturalists will tell you that major depression disorder is an immutable disease that's determined largely by the serotonin regulators in your brain, but our mental states are not divorced from spiritual influences. 

the makeup of your brain, , 

It doesn't take anything awful externally to trigger depression. It's a bio-chemical disorder with a genetic component, and early experience influences where somebody can't appreciate sunsets.
