For [[Goals/Timeline of my life|a long time]] I needed to prove myself. From 2017-2019 I woke up at 5:30AM every day to study my Bible, pray, and then work all day on something productive. My Sunday School wrote a date on a board for me to get a job by, and I felt that I needed to figure something out. I worked hard, prayed hard, and fought hard. But now I feel like I've already proven myself. I've received praise from my father. I've been recognized as smart because of the job God gave me, and the money I've earned. Now that I've lost it, I don't feel the same drive as before to wake up. I feel accomplished. I feel I deserve the next position. And that might be the most dangerous thing.

Faither, please humble my heart to remember my origins. I didn't gain my position from my desk, but from my knees. From the van where I prayed long hours, and the place I need to return. I'm not different now. I'm still dependent on your grace for work. Please provide something to me, Lord. I'm sorry that I withheld the tithe. I was greedy and wrong. I knew it was wrong and I always intended to start again. The numbers were so high, it was hard to part with it. I had my own plans of buying an expensive ring for Mariana, travelling, giving her things with money I withheld from God. This was a huge mistake. But not the reason I was fired.

The reason I was fired, I'm sure, is because I lied. I misbehaved, and when I was questioned about it, I denied it. I lied about it. The Holy Ghost spoke to me, "The truth will set you free," and I lived by fear instead of faith. Ironically the fear that produced lie to protect me is the same fear that produced my downfall. If I had told the truth I would still be at American Airlines. God would have given me that mercy. It was not Stacey who took my position away, or Indhu. It was God. It was justice. It was the wisdom of the Bible being made manifest to me. And now
