# Knowledge Will Cease
Create a payoff chart that shows what value it is to write these plugins for Obsidian. If I spend my life gathering information, and then I die, and then ==in 100 years another catastrophe happens on earth and technology is wiped out, all of that knowledge perishes==. What is the value of the knowledge? Which knowledge should I seek? Are the plugins worth it? Do they have eternal value or temporal value?

# COOK mate Obsidian
[COOK mate](https://www.cookmate.online/en/home/) as a plug-in has temporal value, and there’s already an app for that. Just use your existing app. Don’t waste time building that plug-in. The payoff is that I can link it to a meal planner and create algorithms to choose my diet. This could ==aid in maintaining good nutrition and overall health, which directly affects mindset, which controls everything else==. If I have a healthy mind, I can serve God better than with a glutinous mind.

I can add nutrition facts in the frontmatter, and create an algorithm that pieces together ideal meal plans. It can also support manual meal planning, with a bar showing the macro nutrition quotas.

# Hymn App

Piece together MYOH and Youcision. It should allow users to input the lyrics and a link to an audio file, and use AI to autodetect the timestamps of when the lyrics are sang. This can be accomplished by transcribing the audio file and matching it against the uploaded lyrics.

It should also support auto-detected notes to be sung. Just like Youcision, it will listen to your voice in the mic, and show you what key you are singing in, so that you will be able to tell if you're hitting the right note. Ask ChatGPT to describe Youcision, and then use that description as the feature requirements for AgentGPT to build this app idea.

If the AI doesn't detect the proper notes, or if the notes are sung incorrectly by the singers in the audio file, there should be a edit page to adjust the notes to the correct pitches. 

# OliveTree + Obsidian
Write a plug-in that integrates notes from OliveTree to Obsidian. Either appending to a single note, or creating separate notes.

Ask to be a part of the OliveTree development team. Create a feature to sync audio Bible with the main reading window. Create a feature to let AI read it to you, like Headway’s AI voice. 

Add second brain functionality to OliveTree. Show all the notes that reference a verse, backlinks, etc. Add wikilinks to other notes and show a graph of the correlations to notes as well as verses, and other notes those verses link to.
