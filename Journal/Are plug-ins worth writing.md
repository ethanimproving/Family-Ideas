# Knowledge Will Cease
Create a payoff chart that shows what value it is to write these plugins for Obsidian. If I spend my life gathering information, and then I die, and then ==in 100 years another catastrophe happens on earth and technology is wiped out, all of that knowledge perishes==. What is the value of the knowledge? Which knowledge should I seek? Are the plugins worth it? Do they have eternal value or temporal value?

# COOK mate Obsidian
[COOK mate](https://www.cookmate.online/en/home/) as a plug-in has temporal value, and there’s already an app for that. Just use your existing app. Don’t waste time building that plug-in. The payoff is that I can link it to a meal planner and create algorithms to choose my diet. This could ==aid in maintaining good nutrition and overall health, which directly affects mindset, which controls everything else==. If I have a healthy mind, I can serve God better than with a glutinous mind.

# OliveTree + Obsidian
Write a plug-in that integrates notes from OliveTree to Obsidian. Either spending to a single note, or creating separate notes.

Ask to be a part of the OliveTree development team. Create a feature to sync audio Bible with the main reading window. Create a feature to let AI read it to you, like Headway’s AI voice. 

Add second brain functionality to OliveTree. Show all the notes that reference a verse, backlinks, etc. Add wikilinks to other notes and show a graph of the correlations to notes as well as verses, and other notes those verses link to.
