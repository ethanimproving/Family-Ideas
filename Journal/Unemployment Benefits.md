# I Didn't Think I Was Eligable

Shortly after I lost my job, John Ball said I may need to go to the [Texas Workforce Commission](https://www.twc.texas.gov/) and request unemployment benefits. I wasn't very excited to do that, since I wanted to pour my efforts into getting a new job, and it felt like he wasn't putting confidence in my ability to turn my situation around quickly. I told my dad, and he said, "You're ineligible. You were fired at fault." So I went to the website and it stated, "if you are unemployed or working reduced hours through no fault of your own," so I told John I wasn't eligible.

# Graduation Party

Weeks later my sister had a graduation party, and a friend from church asked me in an enthusiastic way, "Did you apply for unemployment?" His tone was energetic, as if he had good news to impart. I told him I wasn't eligible, and he said, "Dude, I've been fired and was on unemployment for over a year. I mean, it'll probably be only about 1,000 a week, but it's better than nothing. Even if you were fired for saying fags are the most disgusting people on earth, they can still pay you benefits. The worst thing they can do is deny you benefits." After his confidence, I got my laptop and applied for benefits right there.

# TWC Investigation

Weeks went by. I applied to hundreds of jobs. Finally a benefits agent called me on June 24, telling me the Texas Workforce Commission reached out to American Airlines (AA) to understand the reason I was fired, and they said, "Workplace Misconduct." So the TWC asked for what specifically, and AA said, “There’s too many documents to send here. Request a FAX.” So when they requested a FAX, AA said, “There are no documents.” My agent she said something didn’t sound right with that situation, and asked the name and title of the person who fired me, and if she has fired anyone else, and if I saw any “inconsistency of enforcement” for workplace policies. It sounded like she was investigating Stacey now because they couldn’t provide anything specific that I did. So I told her “No, I think they are fair. I mean, I'm not angry at her or anything. If I was acting unprofessionally, she can fire me.” Truthfully I think Stacey was in the wrong for firing Brandon Benham out of a personal vendetta, and Joshua Chick as well, but I don't want her to get in trouble or unnecessary attention. She then asked, "Did they provide you with any kind of handbook of the company policies?" I told her, "No, but there were quarterly learning hub trainings on things like Sexual Harassment, data privacy, etc. Nothing comprehensive about all workplace policies."

All in all my agent was very nice and indicated American Airlines had no legitimate reason to fire me that they could provide to the TWC. She asked detailed questions like, "Did she give you any warnings before terminating you." I told her of the incident a year prior when Stacey pulled me aside to talk about my "negative humor" during happy hour, but she specifically said, "Nobody wants you to stop making jokes," so I thought I was abiding by that by keeping my jokes positive and cheerful. But because they were in enterprise code, she didn't like that. She told me she was worried I had found another outlet for my jokes, and wondered what the next outlet will be if she lets me off the hook. I tried to reassure her that I couldn't premeditate what it would be, but I didn't anticipate there would be one. I wasn't trying to find a loophole in the rules or anything, I was just trying to brighten people's day with funny easter eggs. And if that's off the table, that's not a problem. I just needed to be told that. But ultimately she investigated me and terminated me, probably for something in my private chats. I did express disapproval for certain management decisions, like coming in earlier. 

When I mentioned that last part, the agent said, "Ohhh. Okay." As if it had suddenly occurred to her the true reason why I was let go. She said they would make their decision by the end of the day, and asked if I had any questions. I asked about LinkedIn applications, if they count as a Work Search Activity, and she said if I submitted my resume to a job posting, that counts as a contact.

# Verdict

![](https://i.imgur.com/FsGmdZz.png)

In Texas, like in many other states, ==unemployment benefits are funded by employer contributions to the state's unemployment insurance program==. This means that while you receive the benefits through the Texas Workforce Commission, the funding for these benefits comes from taxes paid by employers into the state's unemployment insurance fund.


1. **Non-Misconduct Separation**: The decision was made based on the finding that your termination was not due to misconduct related to your job, which is a common requirement for eligibility.
    
2. **Employer Contributions**: The benefits you receive are charged to your former employer's account. This means that the unemployment insurance taxes that your employer has paid contribute to the fund from which your benefits are drawn.
    
3. **Appeals and Participation**: Your employer has the right to appeal the decision to pay you benefits. If there is an appeal, it's crucial that you participate in any hearings to avoid losing your benefits or being required to repay any benefits received.
