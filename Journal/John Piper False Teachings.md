- PIPER, The Liberating Law of the Spirit of Life


> "We are justified not merely by one single act of faith at an invitation, we are justified by a life of faith or not at all. That's the first observation."

Piper doesn't make clear that this faith is not genuine by virtue of believing the wrong thing, but rather because they believe the right thing for a little while and then stopped believing the right thing. So much for eternal security, because we receive eternal life during the first act of faith, not after the conclusion of a life of faith. He that believeth hath everlasting life. We receive the Holy Spirit as the seal of our salvation, the earnest of our inheritance. So this distinction is between kinds of faith (believing the wrong thing vs. believing right) not the perseverance of faith (believing right for a little while and then fizzling out).

Second: The coming of the Holy Spirit into the life of a person, and the reigning of that Holy Spirit to overcome the law of sin and death always accompanies genuine faith (Galatians 3:2-5).

In order to be a son of God we must believe (John 1:12), and in order to be a son of God we must be led by the Holy Spirit (Romans 8:14), and these are not two conditions, they are one condition, because it is by faith that we receive the Holy Spirit, and it is by faith that the Holy Spirit reigns in our lives to overcome the power of sin. [I would call that measures of faith, not the integrity of faith.]

Freedom from condemnation in Romans 8:1-2 is made contingent upon whether the Holy Spirit is freeing us from sin in real life. [PIPER, The Liberating Law of the Spirit of Life]

If this is the case, the answer to God being a thief and a liar if he takes away eternal life once you have it is that ... Piper is mistake. If you receive eternal life at the single act of faith, but you're justified by a life of faith, than eternal life is bought on credit as it were. Credit that assumes you will persevere. It's like taking out a loan with 100% surety that you will continue to make the same income. What Piper should have said to support his view is that we are justified by genuine faith, not dissimulated faith, and genuine faith never stops

- What Is the  Sin Not Leading to Death  in 1 John 5?

Sorry, Piper. That's not a balance, that's double talk. And you're a walking contradiction. You are speaking and interpreting this passage in a way that makes salvation from sin, that is the qualifier of what makes a syn forgivable, the ability or power of a man to genuinely repent of and confess it. Where's the cross? You talk about it all the time in your sermons because you know you can't get away from it, but when it comes to real practical passages like this you make man our savior. And you totally contradict that by paying a lip service to the gospel, but you try and ride both sides of the fence. And I'm tired of it, because I love what you say when you're speaking the truth, but then I just don't know what to do with you when you say these kinds of things.

- Why Does John Piper Complicate Saving Faith?

 John 1:11 12 says,  He [Jesus] came to his own, and his own people did not receive him. But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God.  Who received him, who believed in him   those are at least overlapping realities if not identical. But that immediately raises the question, receive him as what? Trust him as what? Messiah? King? Savior? Friend? Lord? God? Counselor? Financial advisor?

- Without Good Friends, You Will Die

Good friends keep each other believing (as though you can believe the right thing for a little while, and then drop out).

You know that if you continue in this, you go to hell?

- A Superior Pleasure

Redefines faith as an affectionate embrace of the savior

- Glory, Majesty, Dominion, and Authority Keep Us Safe for Everlasting Joy

So these professing Christians are not called and they are not kept. And the evidence that they are not called and not kept is that don t crave Christ, they crave physical sensations. They don t prize the God of grace; they prostitute the grace of God.
