Doctrine to Ponder

**God Hears**

One night as I came home from Wednesday night marathon, it was a beautiful outside, so I grabbed my Bible and headed to the park. I was no less than 15 yards from it when I received a text from my brother Caleb that read, “Mom says get back here right now.” In indignation I headed home, questioning why my Mom wouldn’t let me spend time outside with even God at night. As I arrived home I sat down across from the swing in the backyard. With acrimony I uttered selfish words to my Lord, nearly commanding Him to straighten my mom out. As I was rambling off with other requests, for a brief second, I saw sitting on the swing in front of me just a shape, of a head and shoulders. And it hit me that whether or not God was sitting across from me, He could hear me. I was talking to the guy that made the entire universe; the guy who made me! And for a minute I was completely speechless. I was kind of scared even, because whether that shape was him or not, he was there[[EM1]](#_msocom_1) .

**Home Is Not A Place**

Traveling over this past summer has made me realize that home is not a place. Though there is comfort in the walls of my house, my refuge is found in God, and my home *is* the people I call my family; the people which I am connected to by Christ.

**If peace is not the result, it is the means to calamity.**

“There is no way to peace. . . Peace is the way.”

Peace is not standing by and watching people get hurt; peace is not refusing to defend those who need protection; sometimes peace is the quiet voice in your head that’s saying “you did the right thing”; sometimes peace, is making war.

The war is inevitable, let it come. Standing here idle while our brethren suffer isn’t peace! It’s submission to fear; the fear of what is actually already here. You think because we won’t fight back that songs of harmony will be sung? “Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery?” – Patrick Henry

I’m not suggesting we make violent conflict every time we see flaw in order; bully the bullies. Hypocrisy solves no problem in the world. But I must pay tribute to G.K. Chesterton, who said, “The true soldier fights not because he hates what is in front of him, but because he loves what is behind him.” – That, my friends, is what makes us different from what we’re fighting.

“Both pacifists and militarists desire peace in the end. They simply disagree as to how peace should be attained. Some people are saying we ought not be at war, other people are saying ought to be at war, but both parties really do want peace, the question is what’s the best means to get to that end? Is the best means to say, ‘nope we’re not going to fight anybody,’ or is the best means to say, ‘look, we need to fight them because if we don’t there’s going to be more dire consequences down the road’? “ – Frank Turek

**The Sun Will Always Rise**

People are like rain drops; we all come crashing down at one point or another, and when we hit the ground, we splat. We stay there in the darkness all night, thinking we’ll never get off the ground again. But when the morning comes, the sun rises and carries us up. And no matter how many times we fall, the sun will always lift us up the next day. – God is the “son”. Sometimes his timing isn’t what we want, but he’s worth the wait.

**Entropy deteriorate the universe by achieving equilibrium**

When God said all men are equal, he was not referring to mere wealth, or suggesting secular equality to be enforced in the world. But the rich and the poor, do they not both have breath? Do they not both have the right to make the decision to become more or less? These qualities can never be matched with money and power; true power comes from within, you choose what you become.

The physically disabled are not separated by wealth and poverty; disease and famine do not care what you amount to in the halls of abundant prosperity and good fortune. – “Unfortunately tragedy strikes as it pleases”

**Choices Are Constant**

Too many people want to take the easy way out. They pray to God to free them from sin but when they realize they’re still enslaved they blame God. What they don’t realize is that there is no easy way out; it takes commitment, and hard work. It’s not about your initial choice to want it, but your constant decision to make it happen.

**Sometimes Pain Has A Purpose**

Sometimes God isn’t ready for us to be out of our dark places yet. Pain always serves a purpose; maybe that purpose simply hasn’t been served yet. Or maybe we’re just so focused on our distress that we’re too blind to see that purpose. If you really want to break the chains, stop looking at your mistakes.

**Goals Don’t Finish, They Accomplish**

                I think I started making goals because they motivated me to finish. But then I started losing all the reasons that prompted me to make the goal; I started losing my integrity. That’s why it’s important that you have a goal mindset, but you can’t be so focused on the goal that you lose sight of what you’re accomplishing. The key word of a goal is _finish_. Obviously nobody wants to be stuck in goal that never ends; we all make goals to achieve something. But when goals become something to _finish_, what happens when we’re done?

**God’s Love Is Enduring**

Sometimes we all question things about our faith. Sometimes we question whether God really loves us or not, because how could a God so Holy love something so filthy? Just remember, each breath you take comes from God.

**Grace is not always about receiving, but sometimes about shunning**

There was a man who owed a great debt to a lender. Now this man had a daughter, who had a formal dance coming up. She needed a good dress to go, so despite his massive loan he bought her this dress wanting only the best for her. But when his Creditor came and saw her wearing such a dress, he realized this man was wasting his money and questioned his intent on paying him back. He then stopped showing mercy to the man and took everything he had. The family was now on the streets and had nothing as they were mocked. “Oh you foolish man, if only you had dealt with your responsibility instead of squandering what little you had to make your daughter happy, only to rip away her future.”

**Responsibility is not what we arrange to take on, but what’s arranged for us to take on**

Some people believe that abortion is wrong. But even among those who believe it, many support abortion as long as the girl was raped, and never intentionally exercised such immoral activities. ...But bad things happen, to everyone, and the sad reality is that everyone wants to take the easy way out. Sometimes there isn’t an easy way out, but with pregnancy, murder is the easy way out. We’re all faced with struggles, and we’re all handed responsibility that we never asked for, but we can’t let that be an excuse to run away from it. God has a plan for you, and I promise you that aborting of your child is not a part of it. Maybe you have dreams. . . . .dreams that conflict with what you have to face. But sometimes there is something better for us, and we have to let go of our plans to find it.

**For The Love Of God**

“If you love me, you will keep my commands,” those are the words you spoke, but if it’s up to me, I’m doomed. God I have not kept your commands, even when I tried to. Do I even comprehend the shallowness of love? How dare I say “I love you,” when you yourself say otherwise. If it is up to me to keep your commands, my love for you is hopeless. Show me, Father, how to love. Show me how to keep your commands, and I will follow you. Amen.

**Those who follow sin are lead away from God, but the sin of he who runs to God is consumed**

                When I run away from the light, my shadow is always in front of me, as if I’m chasing after it. It leads me to the darkness, until it fades away with it. But when I run away from my shadow, it leads me to the source of the light, until my shadow fades away in the surrounding illumination. My shadow runs after me as I run to the light, but I do not turn around, for I know the light will consume my shadow in all of its glory.

**“Sometimes pain has a purpose.” – John Carl**

Life is like a banana… enough said. But I’ll say more anyway. Sometimes banana peels look perfectly fine, but when you peel it, the inside is rotten. And sometimes the banana peel can look pretty rotten, so we automatically throw it away based on our own judgment, when the inside is actually fine. And sometimes, we get put in a very cold place for awhile; it makes our peel black, while it’s actually preserving the inside.

**If love is emotion, then love is useless**

I doubt you know what love is, and for my sake I hope I don’t either. If what I have felt is love, it is nothing of what God has described it to be. But God doesn’t lie, so I’m confident there is something greater waiting to be explored.

**“Go for the carrot.” – Church Camp**

I have many desires, but my greatest desire is to follow you. But how can I desire what is evil while I’m seeking you? It’s kind of like when I really want to eat something unhealthy, it tastes good, so I have the desire to eat it. But I would rather be healthy, so I have a greater desire not to. Sometimes healthy people gorge...doesn’t mean they’re not healthy anymore. #beingrandom

**Sorrow makes no amends**

I thought I had to show Him that I was sincerely sorry by dejecting my joy, so I fell into depression. But God listens, if you are truly sorry, he knows it. Don’t show how sorry you are by staying down; show how sorry you are by repenting and getting back up.

**Sin doesn’t mean you stopped following the Lord**

A general led an army of solders into battle, each of them following him ready to fight. As they engaged the battle field, some were captured. Some were captive to the enemy until they died, but it doesn’t mean they weren’t the general’s followers.

**Let unity be for righteousness**

A man’s companion should be one who pushes him to righteousness even in her absence; someone who will keep him from evil when temptations rise. She should be someone who stays in his thoughts always, and compels him to deny corruption. If a man asks, “Would you let me go to a strip club?” And she allows it, he should run away from her. One standard every man should have for his inmate is for her to regard a strong set of standers for herself. Love is a very complex choice; it’s patient, it’s kind, it doesn’t envy, it keeps no record of wrong. Who can say he is patient? And who can say he loves? But let every man strive to.

**Refuge 2013: If church is a building than the people are the bricks.**

It’s silly to think you can stand alone, because regardless of your foundation, if you’re just one piece of wood standing up, it won’t take much to knock you down. – Each part of the church helps hold the next part up, we rely on each other to stand against the storms. And sometimes we break; sometimes regardless of our strength something greater than us comes and breaks us. But no storm can break our foundation, which is Jesus Christ. And so when we fall, and we break, nothing can stop us from rebuilding. And we can build with different materials; we can build with gold, silver, wood, hay or straw, their work will be shown for what it is. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each person’s work. So when we build with cheap materials, like wood or straw, our building will burn to the ground. But when we build with expensive materials, like gold and silver, our building stands through the fire. Not only that, but when gold is set to fire, the fire purifies it. So the same tragedy and burns cheap work, actually purifies expensive work.

A church brought together by a common cause is destined to fail. Because the only foundation that will always be, is Jesus Christ. So when people come together to fight some immorality, what happens when the battle is over? Their foundation evaporates, and their building falls.

“The principle of unity is the master principle of landscape design. Unity creates the flow among scale and proportion, balance, accent, rhythm, and simplicity. The landscape design will compliment the surroundings and create an aesthetic appeal that is pleasing and beautiful.” – Introductory Horticulture Seventh Edition (Page 382)

**Two Types Of Judgment**

Second hand information is information that you acquired through gossip. So the debate of judgment being a hypocritical word is relative to the type of information you are using to develop a judgment. There is a huge difference between saying a man is dumb, and saying a man is dumb. You see, when a man can’t speak, he is dumb (dictionary.com, definition two: lacking the power of speech). It’s a fact, or an observation; first hand information.

However, when a man lacks intelligence, he is dumb (dictionary.com, definition one: lacking intelligence or good judgment). This information is a bit more complicated to acquire, because it’s information that we acquire using our own standards of thinking; it can’t be confirmed. So now we start sinking into the opinion oriented judgment. Calling a man wise or foolish, smart or dumb isn’t for man to judge, it’s for God alone to judge.

**Those who think do well, but those who continue to think do better**

Atheists believe what makes sense to them. They search for answers based on evidence, and apply whatever evidence they find to whatever seems logical to them. In many ways they are well educated, but, they actually contain less understanding than a Christian who immerses himself to Biblical truths and still devotes his time to the evidence of his existence. Because atheists find an answer that makes sense to them, and then their done; they don’t have to keep on searching because they found one possible answer, and that’s enough for them. Believers with firm faith and a respect for information keep on searching past just one possibility. Because he keeps searching for answers that align with God’s word.

**It does no good to choose a good road that leads to a place of death**

The road of euphoria leads to the pit of depression. Many take the route because of the scenery and pay no regard to where it is taking them. In the end, they will never be satisfied. I know because I’ve been down the same road, and it led me to a dark place. Little by little the trees start fading, and the plants start dying, and before you know it you’re in such a barren place that all you desire is to get out, but you have no direction anymore. The tears of euphoria never stop falling, and regret stays with you, even from the beginning. You call out for help, but no one can hear. But whoever calls on the name of the Lord will be saved. He offers a pathway that leads out of the place where euphoria takes you, but the path is narrow, and very undesirable.

**Sunday Clothes (Lyric Notes)**

I come to church every Sunday with a suit to respect and commemorate my house of God, but another member comes in rags, but he serves the Lord with a cheerful heart and gives what little he has to the offerings.

I was invited to a party, and I already picked my outfit, see I got this thing that I use like a sword, hold it by my side, it’s the word of the Lord,

There’s a girl that comes to church dressed like a prostitute, a bad appearance for bearing the image of God indeed,

**Hell isn’t a prison for sinners; it’s an escape from God (Book Notes)**

“Hope is the word of a spectator, which is the reason Christians hold fast to it. Because there’s nothing they can do to inherit the grace of God; it’s only what God has already done that can save them. There is but one thing they must do; they must make the decision to accept it. But I can’t, because accepting His grace, means I was a part of nailing my own God to the cross. I will not put Him that low, and so I must accept my own punishment. But it’s alright, because when I am alone with ultimate terror and pain, I will be sustained knowing that God is.” ­– Javen

“You don’t get it do you? Don’t let your pride get in the way of your salvation. When you decide to accept God’s grace, you’re making the decision to nail yourself to the cross with him. You die with him, and become a new creation; you’re born again. So in turn you give up all that you are, and that is all God wants from you. Hell wasn’t made as a punishment for making mistakes in your time on earth; it’s a place devoid of God, for the people that want nothing to do with Him. It’s for all those who deny Him; who deny His grace.” – Some other guy

**Forgiveness isn’t earned**

People tend to confuse forgiveness with compromise. They expect to hear, “I’ll forgive you, but only if. . .” God doesn’t compromise, He forgives. If there was a stipulation it really wouldn’t be forgiveness at all.

**God’s Plan**

Jeremiah 29:11 says, “For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.” Although this scripture is undeniably comforting, we perhaps too often quote it out of context. The message was intended for the exiles of Jerusalem, during the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Assyria, who outcast them. This is what the message said:

This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, _says to all those I carried_ _into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon_: ”Build houses and settle down; plant gardens and eat what they produce. Marry and have sons and daughters; find wives for your sons and give your daughters in marriage, so that they too may have sons and daughters. Increase in number there; do not decrease. Also, seek the peace and prosperity of the city to which I have carried you into exile. Pray to the Lord for it, because if it prospers, you too will prosper.” Yes, this is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: “Do not let the prophets and diviners among you deceive you. Do not listen to the dreams you encourage them to have. They are prophesying lies to you in my name. I have not sent them,” declares the Lord.

This is what the Lord says: “_When seventy years_ _are completed for Babylon, I will come to you_ _and fulfill my good promise_ _to bring you back_ _to this place_**.** For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. Then you will call on me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you. _You will seek_ _me and find me when you seek me with all your heart_. I will be found by you,” declares the Lord, “and will bring you back from captivity. I will gather you from all the nations and places where I have banished you,” declares the Lord, “and will bring you back to the place from which I carried you into exile.”

You may say, “The Lord has raised up prophets for us in Babylon,” but this is what the Lord says about the king who sits on David’s throne and all the people who remain in this city, your fellow citizens who did not go with you into exile— yes, this is what the Lord Almighty says: “I will send the sword, famine and plague against them and I will make them like figs that are so bad they cannot be eaten. I will pursue them with the sword, famine and plague and will make them abhorrent to all the kingdoms of the earth, a curse and an object of horror, of scorn and reproach, among all the nations where I drive them. _For they have not listened to my words,_” declares the Lord, “words that I sent to them again and again by my servants the prophets. _And you exiles have not listened either_,” declares the Lord.

So it turns out that God had a plan for these exiles, who weren’t listening to the words God was communicating through his prophets. A specific plan, this particular plan happens to be a plan of prosperity, after seventy years. But what about his plan for the king who sits on David’s throne and all the people who remained in Jerusalem? They were plans not so prosperous—in fact, they were plans of famine and plague; curses and horrors. So why do we relate his good plans to us instead of the plans of horror? The only thing that separated his plans of horror from his plans of prosperity is “_You will seek_ _me and find me when you seek me with all your heart_.” But who can say they seek the Lord with all their heart? Anyone who believes such an ideal is probably a fool. Most of us, in fact, probably more closely resemble the people which he planned to plague.

But my word is meaningless, because I can’t be the judge of anyone’s sincerity. So let’s instead look at Hosea 4:6, which reads: my people are destroyed from lack of knowledge. “Because you have rejected knowledge, I also reject you as my priests; because you have ignored the law of your God, I also will ignore your children.

Mindless to say, God always has a reason for his plans. And it’s not always a good plan. Some may say this passage is good for principle, such that all who call on the name of the Lord with be saved. That all who seek him with all their heart will find him. But in regards to the fact that he wasn’t talking to us, all we can take away from this passage is this: Do the scriptures portray God as a God without a plan?

**Affliction is of two sorts**

Don’t ever let anyone tell you that their struggle outweighs yours. If you have ever felt sheer sorrow, or a feeling of complete hopelessness, you’ve felt the worst of it. Sleeping outside wet and cold, going to bed hungry, tasting the depths of desperation, or to summarize, any concrete pain doesn’t begin to sympathize with physiological anguish. It is far worse to be a prisoner of melancholy than to live without a roof over your head, or food in your stomach. I can certainly commiserate with corporeal affliction, but emotional distress is the root of all struggle.

**It does not do well to reject the gift of rationality God has given**

God should never be used as an escape from logic; he should be your motivation to reason. People answer with, “because that’s how God made it,” and leave real perception in the dark. It’s no wonder America is outlawing the name of Jesus. You can say God killed someone, or you can say God used bacteria to kill someone. The first only tells you the what, which dwells with ignorance. But the second tells you the how, which reflects understanding.

**A New Creation**

To be baptized into Christ Jesus is to be baptized into his death. Who you are is characterized by how you think, that you say, what you do, and so on. When one is baptized into death, all of these characteristics change, and identity, therefore, is put to death.

**To Die Is Gain**

Approaching our seats for the final camp service Gabe Philpot slapped my leg. Starting a friendly competition I slapped his leg back. He slapped mine again and it continued back and forth until I realized I wasn’t paying attention to the speaker. In an effort to focus on his message I accepted the humility of defeat and desisted to slap him back. A minute later he slapped me again, when I looked over at him, he whispered, “I won.” Still attempting to attend my deliberation to the speaker, I replied, “Okay,” and with hesitation remarked, “But you get no prize for it.” Necessitating to sustain his pride he said, “I still won.” But in truth, where was actual victory? In the one who achieved the last slap, or the one who laid aside the distraction of his pride to learn something from the speaker’s message? Gabe had nothing to gain by executing the last slap, but in fact, only by putting that distraction (and victory) to death was profit.

**If anyone loves me, he will keep my word**

One day as I was trying to convince Faith to read the bible with me, she said, “But all you ever do is read the bible!” Realizing her intention was derogatory, I replied, “You know reading the bible is a good thing, right Faith?” She argued, “But reading the bible too much is a bad thing! If someone asks you to play and is really excited and you say, ‘no, I want to read the bible,’ you might hurt their feelings.”

How often do we do that? Someone needs us to be there for them and we push them away, saying, “I don’t have time for you, I need to spend time with God.” It’s like your spending so much time studying God’s precepts, that you don’t make time to practice them. So be careful where you put your devotion, it’s not always easy to recognize what’s right when you’re doing what’s good.

**Those in Christ ought to be recognized for who they are**

One day during Monday night basketball, I received a text (and this is right after I got a new phone, so I didn’t have the sender saved in my contact list). The message read, “Are you up at church tonight? Trying to make sure Dylan made it there safely, haven’t heard from him.” Right away I knew it was from his mom, Nicole. Because her message comprised an association with church and a concern for Dylan. In short, I recognized who she was, because of the message she carried. In the same way, everyone you meet should recognize who you are in Christ, because of the message you deliver.

**Locked doors have locks for a reason**

One evening as I was watching my neighbors dog, I decided to go in their backyard and sit on the lawn chair, as I opened the door, I noticed the screen door was locked. In slight confusion I unlocked it and pushed on the door, but it was stuck. So I left it at that and locked it as I found it.

The next evening I came back and unlocked it, this time more curious why it was locked, and if I could get it open easily. I pushed, and with a little resistance the door came open. I invited Pedro (the dog) out but he stayed inside. So I sat out on the lawn chair snap-chatting people for awhile, and decided to go back inside.  I walked inside, and tried closing the screen door, but it was stuck.

After a little while of trying to close it from the inside, I decided to close it from the outside and come in the house through the front door. I tried and tried, but the door wouldn’t close, the top was too high and I couldn’t force it low enough to close.

During a feeling of sheer hopelessness, I thought to myself, “. . . . that’s why they keep it locked.” Then it occurred to me, when all else fails, pray about it. So I brought it before God and asked him to let me close it, and practically without struggle, the door closed.

I can’t help but think about how often this happens in our spiritual lives. We see a locked door, and we question why God doesn’t allow us to go there. When we want what’s on the other side badly enough, we open it anyway. For a while, we’re satisfied. But when we get tired of it and we try to get back in, the door won’t close. Only then do we realize why God made such laws. We feel hopeless, and ask God to save us.

**Chase perfection, but don’t marry it.**

When couples are first dating and learning about each other, they’re trying to present themselves in an affectionate manner. But when they’re married, they’ve already achieved their partners affection, and no longer aspire to appear that way.

**Language is a gift from God, and words are alike**

To label a word as _bad_ just because it has a negative origin is prejudice. Words are tools used to articulate ideas and express messages. Without such _bad_ words, correction would cease to exist, and the wicked would proceed their evil practices without remorse.

**It doesn’t do to be paid with man’s empty praise in place of God’s reward**

“Beware of practicing your righteousness before men to be noticed by them; otherwise you have no reward with your Father who is in heaven. So when you give to the poor, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may be honored by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full. But when you

give to the poor, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving will be in secret; and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you.”

Jesus isn’t referring only to the reason of your righteous acts here, but also to how you’re letting people see you. For instance, I’m normally an extensively lazy person, but one weekend when I was at a retreat with my senior class, we had a mission project, and I was randomly very productive that weekend. As we were about to head home, one of the leaders approached me and said, “You are one of the hardest working young men I have ever known.”

I said, “No sir, I’m one of the laziest men you’ve ever known. All the work I did this week, that was not the man inside me, that was God inside me.”

He took a second to think about it, and remarked, “Glory to God.”

I replied, “Exactly where it should be.”

I might’ve had the most sincere intentions anyone could have before God, but if I let that man honor me how he did, I’ve already been rewarded. Or as Jesus put it, _paid in full_. I could have just said thank you, but instead I chose to give the glory to God, because all glory is his anyway.

**The finitude of becoming one flesh**

If there’s no marriage at the resurrection (Matthew 22:23-46), meaning you can’t take it with you to heaven, that makes it an earthly treasure. And if we’re supposed to put our hearts in heavenly treasures, and take our hearts out of earthly treasures (Matthew 6:19-21), . . . .

**Never fabricate the gospel to make it sound appealing**

Multiplying Christianity isn’t selling a product. It’s putting to death those who accept the gospel for what it is, not for how good you can make it sound. Unless you are willing to give up everything you treasure, you cannot be a disciple of Christ. Don’t ever lead someone to blindly follow him. To bear fruit, you must count the cost.

**Don’t bury your treasure**

Faith asked me if I could keep an old truck of mine, because it was one of her favorites and she used to play with it a lot. I said no, and asked if it was one of her favorites why she doesn’t play with it anymore. She replied, “Because I couldn’t find it in all that stuff.” A cleaver philosophy of an obvious occurrence for a child to observe.

**Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him (**[**Psalm 37:7**](http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Psalm%2037.7)**)**

Normally when I run, I do it on the treadmill. It’s nice because it’s indoors, unexposed to the weather, and the fan right above me isn’t so bad either. But sometimes I run outside anyway, just to keep in balanced shape for the group runs I occasionally involve myself in. When it’s cold outside, I bundle up making sure to cover my ears and hands. Usually by the time I get home my hands are freezing cold, and the first thing I do is run them under warm water. Then it stings for a while and I wait it out until they feel better.

One particular Texas evening, I was out for about two hours with the temperature in the twenties, and when I came home I could barely move my hands because they were slightly iced over, so I quickly turned on the faucet to the hottest water it could manage. After putting my hands under the water for a matter of seconds, I was rolling on the floor making unintelligible sounds of pain. While I was trying to identify whether my hands were swelling up or only stinging extremely bad, the idea struck me that maybe it was the water making my hands sting every time. After performing an extensive degree of research (asking my mom), I came to the realization that my hands couldn’t handle the temperature transition so quickly.

But then I think about our Christian walk, and wonder how many of us still haven’t realized that the water is making our hands sting. The water represents an immediate solution to discomfort we go through, that usually take its toll and only increases our pain. Instead of abiding by the fourth fruit that comes from the Spirit of God within us, patience, we look for something immediate and turn to all kinds of sin, such as drugs, food, music, running, etc. There are as many forms of sin as there are men and women, when we turn to anything but God to heal us. We can take good things, like law, exercising, or even honest work, but when we rely on them to make us feel better, we’re relying on hot water to make our cold hands warm up, and it only anguishes us all the more.

**Imperfect isn’t synonymous with useless**

. . . . Maybe we can even prove that our English Bibles aren’t scripture, but so what? Do the Greek and Hebrew scriptures say that all scripture is useful? Yes. Do they say that anything written that isn’t scripture is useless? No. Can God use our English Bibles? Look around you.

**“Bible basher” is the phrase of a bigot**

Apparently when modern Christians tell someone “You’re going to hell”, they’re not “real” Christians. But when Jesus says that sinners won’t enter the kingdom of heaven (Matthew 7:21), does that mean he isn’t the “real” Son of God? Or what about when Paul writes the same thing to the Church of Corinth (1 Corinthians 6:9-10), was he not a “real” Christian? Stop wasting your time condemning the so called “Bible Bashers” and try picking it up to find out they’re doing exactly what they should be doing. Sinners unwilling to repent are those who should be thrown out of the Church (Matthew 18:15-19 - you can take Jesus literally), not the people who are getting the scriptures out there. How people respond isn’t our responsibility,  speaking truthfully with a gentle spirit is. So if you catch someone speaking the truth harshly, why haven’t you gently confronted them yet?

**Test The Scriptures, Hold Fast To The Word**

The scriptures testify about the Word of God, but they in themselves are not the Word. Therefore, no one can pick up a Bible and say, “I have the Word in my hand,” rather he should say, “I have the word in my heart.”

The importance of discerning the contrast between the Word of God and the scriptures is made clear by the people who lecture that you can’t pick out the pieces of scripture that you like and reject the parts of scripture you don’t like, because their argument is on the basis of the “Word of God” being inherent. We know that all scripture is God-breathed and therefore Holy and infallible, thus we have a precedent in knowing that which should be included in our texts that we claim are Holy.

The Nevi’im is justified as coming from God; for no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit (2 Peter 1:21). We also find justification for the entire Tanakh, as Jesus attests to the blood of Cain, beginning in the Torah, to the blood of Zachariah, concluding the Ketuvim (Luke 11:51).

 However, in an English world full of translational error, and especially obscurity in the origins of certain texts included in our Bibles, it is paramount to test all that is not certain, and hold fast to what is good, so as to make sure we’re not simply quenching our spirits by putting our imperceptive trust in every letter that our fallible texts have written (1 Thessalonians 5:19-21).

I’m not saying that you should never read that book because it’s “evil” or that it’s “of the devil” by any means at all, I’m just saying you probably shouldn’t be putting your blind trust and basing your faith on everything in those texts, because they are not God-breathed. The Word of God is the only basis for your faith, the only cornerstone of your salvation, and our Bible, though fallible and not “Holy”, still testifies about the Word of God, who is inherent. Without the testimony, one cannot exceed the adolescence of faith, unless spoken to by the Spirit who empowers those who have received it, as Paul had been spoken to. Yet trusting in that which is subject to fallacy can contribute to a distorted view of the testimony that is God-breathed (the scriptures by the original authors whom God breathed into and appointed for his purpose), which is why Paul wrote to the church of Thessalonica to test all prophesies, and hold fast only to that which is good, rather than to trust in that which was capable of misleading them.

We understand then, that we are not to neglect that which hasn’t been tested, nor trust it, but rather we are to test it. So when people say, “You can’t accept the parts of scripture you like and reject the parts you don’t like,” they are absolutely correct. However, since I’m not fluent in Hebrew Greek and Arabic, it would be rather imposable for me to do that. The best thing I can do, is discover that which has been preserved, and that which has been lost in translation. So when you see me rejecting a “part of scripture”, I’m actually recovering somebody’s interpretation of scripture on the basis of a more educated understanding of it, which came from a criteria set up by various disciples whom God breathed though and made Holy.

**Revised (1 Kings 22:22)**

I believe in truth, and I believe God cannot use deception for His glory and purpose. I also believe to refrain from truth is the same as deception. Thereof, to confront the fallacies of our modern Christian belief’s passively is denying God’s ultimate authority over your life.

**Perfection is not a journey, it is a destination**

Perfection isn’t worth stress, nor is stress the only means to perfection. It’s important to know what’s worth it, because unfounded acrimony has no place with joy, and if it is the means to perfection, than perfection has no place with joy, and has no value.

**What are you feeding your heart?**

Our human hearts are a lot like our stomachs. We need to keep filling it with all this stuff to fulfill us. We get hungry but we don’t really know what we crave, so we fill our hearts with love, pleasure, whatever it is that we think will satisfy us. What is it you’re filling your heart with, and is it satisfying you? We all feel stress, we all feel pressure, and we all seek relief.

**The door is opened by abidance, not salvation**

Baptism is not the act of receiving the Holy Spirit, it’s really just a symbol of repentance and purification. It’s making yourself holy in order that He who is holy may abide in you. When someone is made holy, behold, the Son sends the Counselor unto him, and He stands at the door and knocks. It isn’t salvation that opens the door, it’s keeping His word, which is abiding in Him.

**The Finitude Of A Name**

A name means nothing at all. Look at Albert Einstein, his name is getting all the recognition in the world, but what is he actually gaining from it? Honor? He is not, only the image of his name is receiving honor, which credits him nothing 6 feet below the earth.

Life is a journey, and death is the destination of all who take the journey. Strive not to make life better for others, but direct them in the way to life eternal.

**Dichotomy Of Study**

There are two basic ways in which Christians study the Bible:

One is to equip yourself with the knowledge of the Word so that you can credit yourself, the other is to equip yourself with the knowledge of the Word so that you can credit the Word, or be a disciple of the Word in a sense.

**The Euthyphro Dilemma, Why Is God’s Nature Good?**

Life is in the blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness. This is the reason the Father sent the Son, because Jesus was the life. But if God is the author of his law, why could he not have simply revoked the shedding of blood as being the only way to forgiveness? Because God’s law is not like man’s law, it doesn’t change based on circumstances and it isn’t relative to our fallible standards of morality. God’s law is absolute, it was established from the beginning, and it is perfect. His word is truth, and God’s standard is truth, and the truth cannot be changed.

On one hand, why did he legislate such a law in the first place? Why didn’t he establish a more loving law in the beginning, one where there is forgiveness without bloodshed?

**Deceit is less powerful than Yahweh**

Sometimes people attest to something that never happened in order to make God sound powerful. But is God’s power not evident? Are his glories not enough for you? How vain it is to deceive someone into believing in our Sovereign.

**The Finitude Of Human Efforts**

All human effort is vain, for the gospel cannot be attained through persuasion. Many will necessitate to practice before bearing witness to salvation, as if playing a sport that requires practice to be skilled; they prepare their presentations with a problem, cause, and solution; they advertise the gospel as if selling a product, but all human effort is vain, because the flesh cannot baptize anyone into the spirit, but only he who is empowered by the spirit can baptize with the spirit.

The gospel, then, is made self evident in those who have received it, not persuading scoffers, but living as examples of the gospel message for the world to see. It’s as when Paul was converted on his journey to Demascus, he received no council from men (Galatians 1:11-24), nor did he spend time studying the gospel or ‘practicing’ his speeches; as soon as he was baptized into the Spirit, he went out and baptized with the spirit. His ministry was not by human efforts, but empowered by the spirit.

**Only one law is perfect**

Why did God make the law so blood-centered? I speculate because there is only one perfect order in which men can live. No other law can govern a people like the law of the LORD. Critics might say, “But God’s law didn’t work, that’s why He made a new covenant.” But I would argue that God’s law did, in fact, work, it was the Israelites that didn’t work it.

**Believing in that which no evidence supports is believing in infinite false gods**

All throughout the Bible, right before people believe in something, they see it. And Jesus says “Because you see, you believe. Blessed are they who have not seen, and yet believe.” And we know that faith was credited as righteousness to Abraham. So believing in the truth without seeing it is a righteous thing, but how do you know what’s the truth without seeing it? What if you believe in a lie, how will God judge us for that?

**Dichotomy Of Fantasy**

There are two basic kinds of fantasies:

      ![*](file:///C:/Users/242924/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image001.gif)One is to fantasy hearing something; this variety is detrimental.

      ![*](file:///C:/Users/242924/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image001.gif)The other is to fantasy saying something; this variety is fundamental.

**Does human knowledge make something sinful? 1 Corinthians 8:9-13**

Moral Relativism is the doctrine that the law of the LORD is relative to culture. It can be described as this: The law of the LORD is the sum of God’s moral principles, and how those principles apply to culture (i.e. the way we think, the way we act, our customs and observations, our history etc). The question is, does God have an established law for Americans? And how can we base our law on God’s moral principles? There are only two ways we can institute a law from God: One is by divine revelation, such was the case with Moses, the other is by discovering the principles which are forever established, by means of back-factoring them from the law of Moses. We have the available resources to discover a limited extent of God’s moral principles.

For instance, during the time of Moses, you were considered naked if you pulled up your clothes such that your ankles were exposed in order to run or walk up a staircase. And for this reason, God constituted a law that restricted anyone from walking up to something Holy, in order to prevent them from defiling it with their nakedness. However, this law was established on the basis of that cultures standard of nakedness. The question is, what does God consider naked? We really can’t know this, but we might be able to assume that he was using our standards of naked, because God is the Holiest of Holies, and he came to earth in order to speak to Adam, whom he was looking for, indicated that he was seeking to be in his presence, all the while he was naked. Such being the case, why wouldn’t Adam’s nakedness defile God’s Holiness? In order to draw a conclusion, you are forced to either assume something, or to inquire of God. Perhaps a reasonable conclusion is that there can be no shame in nakedness, without people. If so, it’s not the nakedness itself that defiles holiness, it’s a cultural standpoint of shame.

What we don’t know, is whether or not God has a standard of shame. Clearly there was no shame in nakedness before the knowledge of evil was possessed. Only after attaining knowledge of sin, did Adam know about shame. Without law, there is no sin, because there is no standard of morality.

Until people were aware that nakedness was shameful, nakedness wasn’t shameful.

**Dichotomy Of Humility**

There are two separate types of humility:

1.      _Self focused humility_, in which you expect to receive some degree of honor.

Example: “I don’t deserve you’re grace,” as a means of acquiring recognition that you’ve come to a humble realization.

2.      _Self evaluated humility_, in which you expect to yield some degree of honor.

Example: “I don’t deserve you’re grace,” as a means of confessing your humble realization.

If we’re honest, I think a lot of us when we say, “God, I don’t deserve your grace,” our intentions are self focused. We kind of expect or imagine a loving response from a merciful father, or we’re intending it as a means to appease God and win his favor because we know that God exalts the humble. Or maybe we expect anger, and use it as an effort to make restitution.

**Christian is the claim of the arrogant**

Christian isn’t something that you can call yourself, it’s something that the people around you observe. In the early church, people saw believers and observed that they were like Christ, thus Christ was the standard by which they judged who was like him. Unfortunately, as it is, people in my generation don’t know enough about Christ to compare my lifestyle to his. Therefore, when I say that I am a Christian, if they take my word for it, then I am the standard by which they judge the life of Christ. Instead of concluding me to be like Christ, they conclude Christ to be like me. Can you see the problem with that?

**Teach Heart**

            We can spend our whole lives gathering all sorts of rational arguments for the existence of God, and we might even find scientific evidence that proves there is a God, but if we don’t teach heart, we really haven’t done anything at all.

And Peter tells us to always be prepared to give an answer for hope that is in us, and obviously the witness of creation is a very powerful tool for believers to spread the gospel with (Romans 1), but if we don’t teach heart, we haven’t done anything for the Kingdom of God.

I think Paul insinuates this same idea in 1 Corinthians 13, which reads, “If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.”

I think what Paul is saying here is that in a thousand years it won’t matter who won more arguments, or who was more intelligent, if we never showed them the love of God. Because it’s not winning arguments that represent the Word that we live by, it’s our lifestyles. I think that’s the ultimate account of the gospel; it’s how we live, it’s the difference that God makes in those who receive him.

**Question For Blanchard**

Two men wondered a couple miles from home, and upon realizing it was their normal dinner time, both prayed that they would make it home before dinner started. One man ran home, the other man walked. Which one displayed more faith?

One man directed his efforts to support that in which he had faith, the other man laid his efforts aside to place the situation in God’s control.

**Honest eyes see repugnance**

Sometimes people need someone to tell them they’re beautiful, because all they’ve ever been told is that they’re not. Maybe when they look into the mirror, they don’t feel pretty, but that’s not the sad thing. No, the sad thing is that some people will lie through their teeth to tell them that they’re beautiful. Christians will say that she’s covered with the fingerprints of God; that God created her, that she’s a piece of his art, and to declare herself as ugly would be denigrate the artist. But the truth is, you still have an opinion. You see things around you every day, and something’s you find beauty in, while other things you don’t. Whether it’s true or not that beauty exists in everything God created, you certainly cannot see it through you’re human eyes. You can deceive yourself, you can set up a standard of beauty that has nothing to do with how you appreciate the visual aspects of what’s in front of you, but unless you can look at something with disgust, your idea of beauty means nothing. And I’m not talking about a poetic sort of beauty, or a abstract idea of it, I’m talking about how you judge ocular images, because when someone looks in the mirror and needs someone to call her beautiful, she’s talking about her body. You can certainly love someone you don’t believe is beautiful, you can judge their value from their character, but when she puts on a dress and asks if you think she looks beautiful, you’re in a position to judge her body, not her character. To philosophically escape this confrontation by redirecting her question to answer according to things that God created is to treat her as an object. It’s to say she’s as beautiful as a rock. Or a crab. Or a donkey. You get the idea. Poetry involves comparing her beauty to things that society considers beautiful. We compare different aspects to things like rainbows, jewels, the brightness of the sun, but in every case, it’s comparing it to something of ocular beauty. The point is that it’s poetically naive to contrast her beauty with a donkey. You’re simply deceiving her by avoiding you’re actual opinion of her.

**Subjective morality exists in a people, objective morality exists in God**

You have to be very careful when conferring to moral relativism, because morality is never relative; indicators are. A good example is when Peter says to women, “Don’t braid your hair.” Because in that culture, braiding your hair indicated that you were a prostitute. It’s not that prostitution was bad because of their culture; there is an absolute standard by which morality adheres to, namely God himself, he is good, and his own nature defines what is good. However, his nature is not what condemned the braiding of hair as immoral, it was the culture.

**To die in your sins is to rely on your own righteousness**

“It doesn’t matter what you believe, if you die in your sins you go to hell.” - Ray Comfort

To believe in the Son is the righteousness of God, and sin is unbelief. What you believe determines your sin. Sin is the prison that leads to death, but the gift of God is eternal life.

**Holiness is purified while unholiness is incinerated**

God’s holiness is like a consuming fire. Imagine if a leaf were to come near a fire, what would happen? It would burn up. That’s why God says whatever is unholy must not come near to the holy, because he will die. Paul says to build your life with holy things, like gold and silver which not only stands in fire, but is purified in the fire, so our holiness will be purified in the presence of God’s holiness.

**The sin is the sinner**

Why doesn’t God kill all the evil people in the world? All have sinned and fallen short of the Glory of God. Yet clearly God believes in righteous men, when he destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah he said, “If I find 50 righteous people, I’ll spare all of them. If I find 40, 30, 20, 10 people, I’ll spare all of them.” God spared the righteous, so clearly the sin that we’re born into doesn’t inhibit us to be righteous before God. How can a good God love evil people? Love what is good, hate what is evil. Hate the sin, not the sinner. But then you get into the problem that if man is separate from his sin, then God could eliminate sin without eliminating man’s freewill. What we choose defines us; we aren’t our bodies, we’re our spirits, and our hearts are composed of intentions and decisions. So really, if we choose to do evil things, we are the evil. It isn’t that the sin is separate from the sinner, sin is the sinner.

The Greek that sin comes from means to miss the mark, as in archery. Evil isn’t as much its own thing as it is absence from good.

**Another’s salvation is more important than you own obedience**

As Christians we too often consider the merits of bringing someone to the Lord, but when you’re actually out there as a testimony for the gospel, all you care about is the person. The merits are reduced to nothing compared to the salvation of the person who is saved.

**The Christian communes with the Christ**

What makes you a Christian? In Revelation 3 Jesus says to the Church of Laodicea, “Behold, I stand at the door and knock, if anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and dine with him, and he with me.” The single one element that determines whether or not you’re a Christian is communion. That is to say, if your heart is the dwelling place of God, you’re a Christian. How do you know if your heart is the dwelling place of God? Jesus says in Luke 6 that a tree is known by the fruit it bears. In John 15, Jesus says, “Whoever abides in me, and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit.” Jesus doesn’t command us in this passage to bear fruit. That’s not our responsibility, he says, “Abide in me, and I in you.” Fruit is a promise if we remain in the vine. So what makes a Christian, what makes someone like Christ? Communion. How do you know if you’re communing with God? By the fruit you bear.

**Public schools only raise the children that parents don’t**

The problem with Christians today is not that their faith is being challenged in the public schools, but that their fathers aren’t teaching them the law of the LORD, talking of them when they are sitting in their house, and when they are walking by the way, and when they lie down, and when they rise.

**False Dichotomy Of Salvation By Faith Or Works**

We do a lot to make sure everyone knows our salvation is by faith and not works. We create this simple dichotomy to make the Lord’s salvation easy for the layman to understand. Yet, when we talk about salvation by faith or salvation by works, are they not the same thing? I don’t mean in the sense that when you have faith, works will come. Isn’t faith itself the work of God? Yes, my salvation comes by works, yet faith is the work by which it comes. “For this commandment that I command you today is not too hard for you,” says the Lord, “neither is it far off.” Salvation is by works; the works of God. It’s a vile mistake to misrepresent the gospel in order to simplify it for those who hear it, that they might receive it. “I planted,” Paul says, “And Apollos watered, but God made it grow.” The gospel cannot be received by means of human effort, but only by the Holy Spirit who empowers one to plant, another to water, and finally the seed to grow. “not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith” (Philippians 3:9, ESV).

**Introvert**

An introvert is one who is “predominantly concerned with their own thoughts and feelings rather than with external things” (OED). I normally contend to be an introvert, yet when someone defines introversy as a “shy, reticent, and typically self-centered person,” I am quick to defend my character against such a definition. The truth is I am not shy or reticent. Reticent is “Not revealing one’s thoughts or feelings without hesitation” (OED). I certainly am concerned of other people’s thoughts, yet not because of my character, but rather because the Word that I live by, that is to say, God’s law; because of His character. I am concerned with their thoughts because of Christ... in regard to their beliefs and how they ... yet not in regard to truth.

I am concerned with their belief’s in reference to the truth because I am concerned about them, yet I not concerned with their belief’s in regard to the truth itself.

**Finite crimes will be judged in finitude, but eternal crimes will be judged in eternity**

Forget Hitler’s crimes and his Holocaust; his sins are empty in contrast to mine. The weight of my iniquity measures more severely than the murderer; more fiercely than the adulterer; more brutally than the thief; more vindictively than revilers; more ruthlessly than the sexually immoral. The Priest Eli said this to his sons: “If someone sins against a man, God will mediate for him, but if someone sins against the Lord, who can intercede for him?” Hitler’s sins were against man, and he will be judged; but how much greater will be my adversity? For I have walked into thing after thing after thing transgressing not only God’s law, but God himself.

James addresses people who are praying wrongly, spending it on their passions as adulteresses. He writes, “You adulterous people! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God?” This is as a wife falling in love with another man. ”Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world [this other suitor] makes himself an enemy of God [your husband]. Or do you suppose it is to no purpose that the Scripture says, ‘He yearns jealously over the spirit that he has made to dwell in us’?”

“God is like a husband, and he has a wife, and he yearn over her spirit, ‘I want her, I want her for myself. I’m jealous. And I want her sleeping with me, in my bedroom, and nobody else’s.’ “ – John Piper

**Christ came to save us from our sins in order to give us the Holy Spirit**

The reason Jesus came was not for eternal salvation, but for the Holy Spirit. Eternal Salvation was a thing in the OT. Eternal Salvation comes from believing in the Son (or the Word pre-incarnated). The reason Jesus came was for our daily salvation which we are to fear and tremble. He didn’t come to save us from hell, he came to save us from our sins. He came to not only atone for our sins but to conquer them. He came to make us holy, so that the Most Holy could reside in our presence in this life. The veil between God and man was split when our sins were atoned for, and the Holy Spirit came on us after the resurrection when our sins were conquered.

**The Dynamics Of Language**

Let’s say that the US Law consisted of only one rule: Do not murder. Let’s further say that it comes about when a certain man walks through his neighborhood, another man strikes him down and kills him, in order to eat his flesh so his hunger will be satisfied. The man is taken to a court to be judged, and the judge says, “You broke the law.” But the man replies, “Well, no I really didn’t, because I define murder as killing someone for no reason, but I killed this man to satisfy my hunger. Therefore, I had a reason and am not guilty of breaking the law.” What’s the judge going to say? That’s not going to fly! It doesn’t matter how that individual defines murder, he’s guilty of breaking the law because the words that make up the law cannot be changed by simply thinking of the words differently. They have an actually meaning that appeal to some standard, and in order to sustain the law, that standard cannot be made up of individuals or societies.

**Fear has the capacity to harbor trust**

I am scared of heights; heights terrify me. But facing them is one of my absolute favorite things to do. When I drop from 180 feet in the air, that is when my trust in the Lord is most secured. “I’m falling, I have no control over this, I’m in your hands.” If you go out to be a witness for the Lord, and you are not scared to the point where you have complete trust in the Lord to govern the situation, there is danger that your entire witness is coming like the witness of a mere human; it is useless.

**The Holiness Of God’s Image**

We were made in God’s image, and every time God comes down in a form he covers himself because every time the holy comes into contact with the unholy, one of two things happens: either the holy is made unholy, or the unholy is consumed. So when God covers himself, he’s protecting us from being consumed. Our holiness, on the other hand, isn’t perfect like God’s holiness. So when we show each other our bodies, we don’t consume each other; we make each other unholy.

**Your deeds describe more of your heart than your thoughts do.**

How people first see you is more of who you are than the person at your core. Your core most inner thoughts and emotions don’t define you; your words and actions do. You judge a meadow by the grass, not the soil that’s beneath it. If a meadow has good soil underneath, it’s grass will be green. Only the people who are willing to dig deep and get dirty can appreciate your soil, but most people will only appreciate the effects of your good soil; green grass.

You judge a meadow by the grass, not the treasure that’s buried beneath it.

But God searches the heart. Praise God that he looks at are heart! But cursed are we, because even and especially in our heart, none are righteous. But let praise never cease from our lips unto God, because when our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart.

**A Generation Of Righteousness**

And I saw written on them that generation after generation will do evil, until a generation rises up and does righteousness. That generation was the generation of acts chapter 2, when the Holy Spirit descended from Heaven. After that there was this Jesus culture, and man started to stand before God not in wickedness, but in righteousness. “And the righteous will be humble,” because all of our righteousness is not our own, but from God. No one can boast about their contaminated Spirit wrought efforts at righteousness, because just like in Isaiah’s day, all of our righteousness is as filthy rags.

**How you interpret the scriptures matter**

The roots of innumerous misunderstandings is not being able to articulate your state of mind perfectly. People interpret everything you say a little bit different then you intended it, and sometimes the listener takes unlicensed liberties to fill in the blanks of things that the speaker never addressed. For adequate communication to exist, the listener must employ effort to understand how the original communicator intended his message. Fundamental to interpreting the Scriptures is applying certain hermeneutical principles.

For example, how can you tell the difference between a upper-case “I” and a lowercase “l”? If I were to write, “I’m lamentably ill,” there would be four characters that could be interpreted as either an I or an L. You only know the difference because of the context. We apply certain grammatical rules to distinguish between the two characters.

Even when we don’t apply these grammatical rules, we can normally decipher the meaning of a set of word based on how they correlate to one another. For instance, when I get on Facebook, someone might write, “ill have sum cash 4 a sk8 bored 2marrow.” I would interpret that message to read, “I’ll have some cash for a skateboard tomorrow.” If I tried reading each word on its own basis without regard for its context, and then collated it afterward, I might interpret his message to say something like, “I need a total of 4 dollars to buy bone marrow because I’m ill.” It would be a complete misinterpretation of what the original author had intended to communicate.

**A man is under no obligation to submit to his wife if he can deny her with reverence to Christ**

The only time a man is under obligation to submit to his wife is in reverence to Christ. That is to say, a woman has no authority over her husband to demand anything without reverence to Christ. For example, when Job’s wife said to him, “Do you still hold fast your integrity? Curse God and die.” He was under no obligation to submit. His authority was over hers for two reasons: The first is because he revered God in his defiance, the second because God gave man authority over woman in matters pertaining to this life. The only instance in which a man is under obligation to submit to his wife is if in his defiance he is irreverent to Christ. The only time it is acceptable for a woman to defy her husband is if she does it with reverence to Christ. She submits to the Son first, to man second, and to herself last.

If a woman demands something of her husband that he can submit to with reverence to Christ, but deny with reverence to Christ just the same, he is under no obligation to submit. If a man, on the other hand, demands something of his wife that she can submit to with reverence to Christ, but deny with reverence to Christ just the same, she cannot deny him without denying Christ.

If a man can deny his wife with reverence to Christ, it doesn’t matter whether or not he can submit to his wife with reverence to Christ, because she is under his authority, and he doesn’t compromise his submission to Christ by denying her. He can. If a woman can submit to her husband with reverence to Christ, it doesn’t matter whether or not she can deny him with reverence to Christ, because she is under his authority, and she doesn’t compromise her submission to Christ in submitting to her husband.

**Born Again, But Born Of What?**

Essential to the gospel is one of two views: You can look at that which constitutes a given person as two parts (a body and a spirit) as the dichotomist holds, or as three parts (a body, soul, and spirit) as the trichotomist would claim. Fundamental to both views is the understanding of a physical mind. In your head lies an abundant mass of gray and white cells we call the human brain. Through recent technology, scientists have been able to monitor brain activity as a person thinks. This is something that happens in the physical. Evolutionists assert that we don’t determine how we think; every decision you have ever made and every thought that has passed through your mind is the result of chemical reactions. The inference is that we occupy no control over these reactions; the choices we make emanate from the way that we’re programmed to work. Our thoughts are wired to think that way and there is nothing you can do to change how your brain is designed to work.

Clearly, both the dichotomist and the trichotomist alike disagree. Both positions, however, must become aware that a person thinks and makes decisions in the physical. Science has made that undeniable, and to resist that fact is the resistance of an ignoramus. A dichotomist as myself would argue that there is some metaphysical mind that transcends the physical brain, in which allows us the ability to overcome the natural decisions our brains chemically make. Sometimes people make decisions that nature cannot account for, and there is no reason that a person should have reacted in a way that they did. Holding this position, I argue that a non-believer as a believer alike, both contain that which transcends the physical brain, something I would call a mind, or a spirit. If a non-believer does not already have something that transcends his physical thinking, than he cannot be accountable for neither his sin nor his rejection of God, because no one can be held accountable for their nature unless they have power over it. If the non-believer has no spirit already, the only way in which he can be saved is if his brain chemically reacts into trusting Jesus. If he cannot overcome his nature prior to receiving the Holy Spirit, and his nature rejects the gospel, he cannot be accountable because he had no power to make a decision apart from his nature. If his brain chemically reacts to reject Jesus, and he possesses nothing that transcends his chemically reacting physical natured brain that he has no control over, his rejection was not his own decision, but pre-destiny.

When we’re born again, is there a third entity which enters our person, or does it rather mean that the characteristics of our old mind were put to death and traded for new characteristics? Since there is nothing else of a spirit, if your spirit is no longer defined with the same identity, there is nothing left of your old Spirit. It has no other attributes and therefore it has passed away, being replaced with a new identity and definition, and therefore a new Spirit altogether.

If I asked you, “will you pass the salt?” And you reply, “yes Ethan, I will pass you the salt, because Christ died for me and these two hands of mine that should be pierced with nails have no wound. Therefore, I will pass you the salt, not because of who I am, but because of who Christ is.” And your words might be the most sincere thing in the world, but if you don’t pass me the salt, you words are empty. So when I say your words are more powerful than your actions, they are. Without actions to fill it, you make enemies; with actions to fill it you make friends.

**Subjective Perception**

Our ideas of morality come from each other. If my parents or sisters are home, I won’t turn my speakers up very loud, but it’s not because I think there’s something wrong or immoral about it, it’s because they have communicated distaste for it in the past. Whereas, if it’s just my brothers and I, I’ll blast them as loud as we want. So in one sense, I’ve created rules and guidelines that won’t allow me to do something under certain circumstances, but if those circumstances change, the rules won’t always apply. Rules can be absolute until somebody asks, _why is it wrong?_ _Because God said it_ might be a sufficient answer, until somebody else asks, w_hy did God say it?_ _He just did_, doesn’t serve to telescope the character of God as described in the Bible at all. This seems to be an example of _might makes right_; He could have declared something totally different to be the good, and so it makes good and evil arbitrary.

**Doctrine of Forgiveness**

Recalling Luke’s long hair, when he said, “We can just forget that ever happened,” I was thrilled to forget about it, because it meant he wasn’t going back to it. In the same way, God is no less thrilled to forgive our sins.

**Jesus’ Mission Cannot Be Understood In Terms Of Logic To The Illogical**

There’s a story in the Bible about a women named Mary, and in it, Jesus comes to her house with his disciples. Now Jesus had just risen Mary’s brother, Lazarus, from the dead, and Mary, who was a women of modest means, was so excited to see Jesus because she loved Him so much that she poured out what was probably the most valuable thing she had on his head. Immediately the disciples are astonished; they were disgusted. They thought they knew Jesus’ mission better than He did. It’s a mistake to try and quantify the mission of Jesus in terms of logic. Not because Jesus’ mission isn’t logical, but because we aren’t.

**Arbitrary Intelligence**

What are the chances in this 1920 x 1080 picture I made on Photoshop that every pixel would be arranged in such an order that it would create this precise picture by chance alone? If there is no soul, then everything that happens in my brain is governed and determined by the laws of nature, declaring that this design of mine happened by complete chance. If you say the universe is simply intelligent, then there must be some intelligence behind it. And frankly, all evolution does is says that the universe is highly intelligent so as to let animals and chemicals adapt exactly how it needs to adapt in order to survive. That’s not chance, that says, “There’s something intelligent going on here!”

Is there any chance in the universe that any given picture I take could be taken and displayed on a screen in the absence of intelligence? And yet we are to believe the things that I take the picture _of_ came from an unintelligent cause?

**The Holy Spirit Does Not Mumble**

God, after He spoke long ago to the fathers in the prophets in many portions and in many ways, in these last days has spoken to us in His Son (NASB Hebrews 1:1-2). “The Writer” here identifies that there are many ways in which God speaks to us. However, he’s not referring to how God speaks to our individual hearts, he’s looking through the grand scope of how God speaks through his written Word, namely the prophets and His Son. If the Holy Spirit speaks to our individual hearts, if there is this personal communication between the Spirit and the man, then why did Jesus find it necessary to write the seven letters to seven churches in Revelation chapters 2 and 3? Why not simply “speak to their hearts”? One might answer that although God speaks us, we don’t always listen, but if we aren’t listening to the Holy Spirit, are we really going to listen to a piece of paper? Some will say that it’s not that we’re neglecting what the Holy Spirit is saying, it’s that we can’t hear it when we aren’t listening for it, and the written words are his way of getting our attention. You don’t think the Holy Spirit can get our attention? As if we need to put Him under a microscope, “Poor Holy Spirit, He’s so small, we need to make Him look bigger. Just be still and listen, He’s speaking, you’re just not listening hard enough.”

**Hidden Weaknesses**

On August 1, 2007, the bridge which spanned the Mississippi River in Minneapolis collapsed, resulting in the death of 13 people and injuring 145. It was a 40-year-old bridge, and quite obviously there were hidden weaknesses that went undetected until it was too late. Sad to say, it can also happen to Christians.

**Does it make sense that demons should communalize that which they fear?**

It makes no sense to equate demons with hell-like images. That is to say that images of hell are a portal through which demons are present. Imagine I bring up a picture of the one place demons fear and they convoke at the symbol of they’re everlasting torment. . . . Does that follow any form of psychology we are accustomed to?

**Correlation Between Physical & Spiritual Cleanness**

There is a correlation between spiritual uncleanness and physical uncleanness. In the Law, if you touch a dead man, you become unclean. If seminal touches you, you must wash yourself and you will be unclean until evening.

**Love Is Not A Slippery Word**

If love is the primary goal you’re pressing toward, it’s essential that you have a clear understanding of what love is. Love is never passive, it’s active. If I’ve got a friend whose drinking a deadly poison, and I see that, would it be loving or unloving to say, “Well I really don’t need to be telling him what he should and shouldn’t drink, I should just look at my own glass and make sure what’s in my cup isn’t poison”?

**Set Your Eyes On Things Above**

I’ve noticed that when I’m on a diet, my spiritual life tends to be more active and awake. But it’s not because my physical body is being nurtured and cared for, it’s because of the mindset I have that’s nurturing my body is the same mindset that nurtures the soul. When I’m on a diet I’m saying that I’ve set myself to something more than what brings me immediate pleasure, I’m pressing towards something beyond what will make me happy right now. Changing your lifestyle is about a winning mindset, and that mindset affects everything in your life, not just one thing that you think you ought to get serious about.

**Can the greater good be served by an evil act? (Since God is good)**

“It is unthinkable that God would do wrong, that the Almighty would pervert justice.” This passage is suggesting that wrong is not synonymous with bad, but with justice. Bad things happening to bad people is bad for them, but it isn’t wrong because it’s justice.

I form light and create darkness, I make well-being and create calamity, I am the LORD, who does all these things. - Isaiah 45:7

As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good in order to bring about this present result, to preserve many people alive. – Genesis 50:20

Then My anger will be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them and hide My face from them, and they will be consumed, and many evils and troubles will come upon them; so that they will say in that day, ‘Is it not because our God is not among us that these evils have come upon us?’ - Deuteronomy 31:17

Wherever they went, the hand of the Lord was against them for evil, as the Lord had spoken and as the Lord had sworn to them, so that they were severely distressed. - Judges 2:15

Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech, - Judges 9:23

Watch, if it goes up by the way of its own territory to Beth-shemesh, then He has done us this great evil. But if not, then we will know that it was not His hand that struck us; it happened to us by chance.” - 1 Samuel 6:9

Now the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and anevil spirit from the Lord terrorized him. - 1 Samuel 16:14

When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, “Blessed be the Lord, who has pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal and has kept back His servant from evil. TheLord has also returned the evildoing of Nabal on his own head.” Then David sent a proposal to Abigail, to take her as his wife. - 1 Samuel 25:39

I am weak today, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah are too difficult for me. May the Lord repay the evildoer according to his evil.”

Thus says the Lord, ‘Behold, I will raise up evil against you from your own household; I will even take your wives before your eyes and give them to your companion, and he will lie with your wives in broad daylight. - 2 Samuel 12:11

Behold, I will bring evil upon you, and will utterly sweep you away, and will cut off from Ahab every male, both bond and free in Israel; - 1 Kings 21:21

“Do you see how Ahab has humbled himself before Me? Because he has humbled himself before Me, I will not bring the evil in his days, but I will bring the evil upon his house in his son’s days.” - 1 Kings 21:29

thus says the Lord, “Behold, I am bringing evil on this place and on its inhabitants, even all the curses written in the book which they have read in the presence of the king of Judah. - 2 Chronicles 34:24

## Conviction: Spirit or Knowledge?

If conviction was the Holy Spirit acting independently of our knowledge of the law, then we would be convicted for transgressions we didn’t know were wrong. If conviction was our knowledge of the law acting independently of the Holy Spirit, then conviction would be a decision we make, not guilt that we are subjected to. Knowledge of the wrong in itself will not convict the wrongdoer.

## Political Injustice

Because there is such a thing as jury nullification, the matter makes guilt irrelevant, replaced with the question of whether or not the law is reasonable.

## Chapter and Verse Divisions in the Bible

 get rid of the chapter and verse divisions

don’t chop them up into separate thoughts, rather see the constant, continuous flow of thought the writer intended.

Hebrews 5:12-6:8

In Acts 17:30 God calls all men everywhere to repent, and in 2 Peter 3:9 God is not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.

John 6:44 implies that God initiates the process by drawing people to Christ.

John 12:32 says “I will draw all men unto me.”

So all men are drawn, and we are judged based on our response to that drawing and calling of God.

Encourage each other daily.

## Strategies for Holiness (Testimony)

When the clutches of temptation ensnare a person to a point of sin, if he is under the law, he is convicted with guilt and hostility toward his transgression. In this state, one night after being lured by a character on Gilligan’s island, I couldn’t stand to return (or continue) to that state. I prayed, and from the edge of the blade God delivered me. I thought to myself, “the first temptation is the hardest, if I can make it through the next two, I’ll be able to continue long term.” The next day I was minerly tempted, and simply kept my phone out of arms reach thinking there was really no problem, that I had temptation number two under control. Ten minutes later the temptation emasculated itself to a point that was much more difficult to resist. I was enticed by sin. I wondered to myself, how could this be? I was literally at the edge of the blade last night, today wasn’t nearly as intense as that, yet I conceded to sin’s temptation. Why? I forgot that it isn’t a man’s power to resist sin, and that victory belongs to God; I didn’t pray for deliverance that time. It wasn’t that I had some prideful emphasis that I had achieved victory last night, it just didn’t occur to me to pray this time.

## What If The Apostles Believed A Lie?

How would you respond if somebody said that Jesus, the Son of God, was not the Son of God? That He was an instrument of the Devil?

The Devil was the model of perfection, full of wisdom, perfect in beauty, in Eden, clothed in precious stones, the anointed cherub, blameless in his ways from the day he were created until unrighteousness was found in him ([Ezekiel 28:12](http://www.godonthe.net/evidence/satan.htm#Eze_28_13)-15)

Satan can perform miracles (Exodus 7:8-12). In the community of people who hold to the teachings of Jesus and Paul, nobody is turning away from their sins. Satan is a crafty liar, he knows the prophesies, he has power to perform miracles, his house is not divided, he can speak so as to capture loyalty (demons followed him, even into hell), why would the apostles die for what they thought was a lie? They thought it was true because Satan tricked them.  – God’s voice spoke from heaven saying, “This is my son, in whom I am well pleased.” The prophets testified about Jesus in the Holy Scriptures. Jesus was resurrected from the dead. Jesus ascended into heaven. The apostles received power when Jesus sent the Helper to them.

“A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic--on the level with a man who says he is a poached egg--or he would be the devil of hell. You must take your choice. Either this was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse. You can shut him up for a fool or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God. But let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us.” ~ C.S. Lewis

## The Gideon Dilemma

 Remember the story of Gideon; God wants to display his unlimited power. He wants to make it evident that God Himself is fighting for Israel without question. So Gideon’s got this army of 22,000 men, and God says, “Nope, that’s too many. Israel is going to say ‘our own power delivered us.’ “ God says, “I want them to know it was me.” So Gideon took these 22,000 and said, “Listen, whoever is afraid to fight the Midianites, go ahead and go home.” And 12,000 Israelites went home. And God said, “The people are still too many; bring them down to the water and I will test them for you there.” He’s got 10,000 men and he takes them down to a stream to drink water, and 9,700 of them get down on their knees to drink water. Why? Because that’s where the water is. Physics; distance of the water from your mouth, shorten it. But three hundred of them, three out of every hundred, three percent, did it differently. They bent over, put it in their hand, and sipped it. And they’ve got 9,700 of them looking at the 300 saying, “Are you stupid? Get down here on the ground with the rest of us, this is where the water is,” and the three hundred are like, “Oh no you don’t understand, I don’t know where the enemy is and I don’t know which direction he’s going to come from and I can’t let down my guard so I’ve got to drink my water this way, I’ve got to be instant in season and out of season, I cannot let down my guard.” And God says, “I want these guys who don’t let down their guard, who don’t go to sleep. Send everybody else home, I want the people who are capable, I want the people who are competent and qualified to go to war.” But God, I thought you wanted to make the battle so impossible for Israel to win that it would be undeniable that you are fighting for us? Wouldn’t you want the unqualified? Don’t you want the incompetent and incapable? Why choose the guys who able and disciplined? “Because,” God says, “My power is not manifested in people who think it’s okay to act amateurish. My power isn’t perfected in people who are lax about going to war. My power is not made evident in people who think that because I’m fighting for them they can just drag their feet and coast while I win their battles. That’s not how it works. And don’t think the three hundred men I chose were qualified for victory. Nobody in Israel is qualified to defeat the Midianites. I don’t call the qualified, I qualify the called. What you don’t understand is that I don’t call everyone who’s in Israel. I call the people who believe that I will deliver them, and the people who are alert in that faith.”

# Bad Hermeneutics

## “Find You (feat. Complexion)” Meaning

“These rooms keep changing color, but I can’t find you.” This song is taking place in the rooms where we... the rooms represent God’s temple, which is the place you go to pray and relate with God. It’s where God’s Spirit is. The colors represent different states of the outer adorning of the temple. In the old testament they kept on changing the colors of the temple, adding gold floors and shields and such. It represents circumcision, the outer adorning of the law. The author is saying that she keeps changing the adornment of how the law relates to her. The colors are fluctuating, sometimes she keeps the law, adorning it, and sometimes she breaks the law, muddying it. But through all of her obedience and disobedience, she can’t find God. The running shadows represent the law, she can’t seem to keep up with it. There are times of obedience when she is in the shadow, but inevitably it always leaves her behind.

# The Reason For Jesus

## Why Isn’t God’s Mercy Enough Without Jesus?

The entire framework of Christianity rests on the belief that “no one is righteous, no not one.” That we’re born wicked and cannot ever escape that nature. Christians depend on the assumption that man can never be righteous enough to get to God by his own obedience. We say that God is holy, and his holiness a consuming fire. We debase God’s mercy and great compassion (Psalm 51), saying it’s not great enough to forgive us. We call Him unjust, because He said true justice is mercy. If God’s mercy is so great, why is it necessary that my righteousness is Christ’s counted as mine? Noah, Job and Daniel all saved themselves by their own righteousness, and the law is not out of reach. Why should God redeem those who remain in their wickedness and require the righteousness of someone else? If it wasn’t for Christ, I wouldn’t be a Christian. If it wasn’t the son of God who taught these things, I would not believe them. As it is, if Christ hadn’t come, I would be obligated to keep the whole law, so says Paul. What if Paul has it wrong? What if Christ came to equip us with the Holy Spirit, tearing the vail between man and God, do that we have access to a greater power to produce righteousness in our lives? What if He came to give us tools to be righteous? What if we still have to be righteous? Like

## God’s Holiness

Holiness is just a fancy word for God’s righteousness. God made light, and He set it apart from the darkness in such a way that light and dark cannot coexist. Darkness is all that is not light, and lightness is all that is not dark. In the same way God is all that is not sin, and sin is all that is not God. Sin is the absence of God, God is set apart from sin and if we are unholy, we cannot be of God because the two cannot coexist.

## Why Didn’t God Guard The Tree Before Adam Sinned?

 Why would God put the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil in the Garden of Eden? Why didn’t He just put it somewhere else, or not even have it at all? The Genesis account says that God planted the Garden of Eden and put Adam to live there. Yet it wasn’t until after Adam sinned that he protected the tree. Is there some Heavenly rule that says you have to give somebody the option to sin? It would be like a dad saying, “While you really ought to have a gun in your room so you can have the option to disobey me when I say, ‘don’t use it.’” What? I don’t picture the events of Eden like that. Why was the tree there? Why did God find it necessary to put that world-changing tree in the garden with Adam?

## God’s Forgiveness Is Reconciliation, Not Tolerance

 Sometimes I get so caught up in thinking about God’s grace I forget that Jesus died. Sometimes I think so heavily on the mercy and forgiveness and free gift of God towards us that I forget about the cross. Sometimes the cross is so small that His grace is reduced to leniency, but that’s not the way it was, His grace came through blood, and the blood of the Son of God. If that kind of death was unnecessary, if the whips that lashed Him wasn’t required on our behalf, if the nails in his hands and feet wasn’t central, then the cross would not have happened. It wasn’t something that happened to Jesus by accident. It wasn’t something that would have inevitably been done to Him because he was a “rebel.” Jesus prayed, pleaded before His Father that this cup be taken from Him. He could have called down legions of angels, He could of summoned fire from Heaven, but He let the dirty hands of sinners strike Him, and He who knew no sin was made to be sin on our behalf. [I think that’s what Jesus really didn’t want. I don’t think He was afraid of the cross, I think He was afraid to be made sin.] So I ask, then, why? Why did Jesus bear that immeasurable weight and burden if God’s grace is simply Him tolerating us? No, God’s grace is Him reconciling us to Himself, not “putting up” with our sin.

## Can You Change The Holy Sabbath To Sunday?

Chariots Of Fire tells the life of a man, Eric Liddell, born in China, a renown runner. He refused to run in competition on Sunday because he would not do what God would not permit, and it was forbidden to work on the Sabbath, on Sunday. Yet was it out of ignorance that he did not know it was the seventh day God rested and made holy, not the first day? We celebrate on the day Jesus was raised from the dead, and we travel father than the Sabbath permitted in order just to gather together. People have changed their day of rest from the seventh day to the first. Is this warranted, indeed holy to the spirit of the law, if not the letter of the law? God consecrated to Himself every firstborn in Israel, allowing, even commanding us to redeem our firstborn sons with a donkey, and the donkey with a lamb, and if too poor to afford a lamb than two doves, and if too poor to afford two doves than an epha of grain, yet God would not accept an animal for which He did not appoint in the letter of the law. To sacrifice a fish or an elephant would not be acceptable-it would be to change the law. God required incense to be burned and ordered up to Him,

When Aaron’s sons made a fire before God, God called it strange fire and killed them. We cannot change the letter of ceremonial law, lest we defile ourselves and transgress the LORD’S commandments. Sunday is not the Sabbath, America, Saturday is.

## What Cosmic Rule Of Holiness Requires Blood?

Why did Christ die? Why couldn’t God just forgive us without shedding the blood of His Son? Either there is some objective incompatibility between holiness and un-holiness outside of God that He doesn’t decide, or God will simply not defy His glory. Either way this tells me that some objective cosmic phenomena at the death of Christ happened in the laws of the cosmos that renders the unholy as holy. The goodness of God must keep transgression balanced, justified, paid for, or however you want to say it. (Either God doesn’t decide that His holiness consumes un-holiness like a fire, or He doesn’t decide that our un-holiness defies His holiness, otherwise the death of Christ to move cosmic laws isn’t necessary). Christ was afraid of something on that cross and I don’t think it was the nails. When we sin, we upset the balance of cosmic justice, and Christ who knew no sin would be made sin. Why? He died and was made sin? Dying isn’t a sin. It’s the result of sin. Why should His death result in sin? That’s backwards. Unless He who did not inherit death because of sin drank it for us.

## Don’t Train Up Your Kids To Love The World

One of the most selfish methods of parenting is making your children happy. Parents can’t bear to see their children experience hurt, but such sympathy does not stem from compassion. No, for compassion is only a virtue if it seeks the best for the afflicted. The reason parents don’t like seeing their children hurt is because their children are very precious to them. My first mango tree was precious to me, and all of my research told me that pruning the tree was its best chance for a healthy life, but in the end I couldn’t do it because I was too nearsighted thinking about what the tree would undergo when pruned it to look at what was best for my tree. My tree suffered because of it, and even died. Think about it; that tree suffered because of actions I neglected to take with it. I was responsible for pruning my tree, I knew my tree would develop better if I cut it, yet there was some part of me that neglected to do what ought to have been done, and the reason was not compassion, it was selfishness. I knew the tree would heal after I cut it, and even excel. It’s because I had set my mind to the present time that I neglected to put my tree under hurt. If I had set my mind to what was best for that tree, I would have pruned it and it might still be alive today. But no, no, no, I wasn’t thinking of what was best for my tree. I was thinking of how my tree would be hurt. Why should my tree being hurt matter to me? The reason we care about other people experiencing hurt is because we can understand what they might be going through. Maybe we’ve gone through it, maybe we can conger up the experience in our imaginations, but the bottom line is that we take somebody else’s interest into our own consideration, and how can that be selfish? Selfish means you’re thinking about yourself, sympathy means you’re thinking of somebody else. It seems rather antonymous when you think about it. But let me repeat what I said at the beginning: The reason parents can’t bear to see their children hurt is because they think about the hurt their children will feel. They think about what’s precious to them. If their child was not precious to them they would not hesitate to see their child hurt. The reason parents’ abuse their children is because their children are not precious to them. So sympathy depends on what you think is valuable. The reason you hesitate to see your children hurt is because you consider them a treasure. They are important to _you_. The reason you think about _them_ is because they are important to _you_. If they were not important to you, you would not think about them.

## The Joy Is Worth The Birth Pains

 A man doesn’t think of his wife, “She will endure great pains in childbirth, therefore I will not lay with her so she will be with child.” No, he knows the joy that child will render her when the pains of childbirth has passed. Frankly, to obstruct that joy to avoid the pain of childbirth is not thinking about your wife! It’s called not thinking at all. You can be selfish, you can be compassionate, but most parents are simply ignorant, not thinking at all. Not in their best interests, not in their children’s best interests.

## Press Toward The Prize

In every area of life, we can look at the prize, or we can look at the labor and toil it takes to get the prize. People who only look at the things it takes to get the prize don’t do the things it takes to get the prize. Why? Because they have their eyes set in the wrong place. Paul said I press for the prize. If all you’re thinking about is work and labor and toil and pain, none of that is profit. In fact all of that is a burden. We tend to be more joyful when we don’t have to endure hardship. We don’t endure burdens for the sake of having hardship while we carry it. We look toward the prize.

If we don’t look toward the harvest we won’t sow.

If we don’t look toward the child we won’t endure the pain of childbirth.

If we didn’t look to free the slaves the great state rights war would never have been fought.

## American Christianity Is A Joke

and out of some twisted idea that avoiding the hurt is what’s best for your child

I can’t take Christians seriously. It’s in the way we entertain ourselves, it’s in the way we eat, it’s in the way we let the advancement of technology impede healthy community in our world. If one thing should’ve preserved community, real life community, it should’ve been the Church.

## Words For Life

If anyone confronts a moral dilemma and does not know if something is permissible, rather beneficial, he can know if it is godly by answering this question: Would Jesus do it?

## Caleb’s Room Was Messy

What I noticed is that I felt fine with the mess in Caleb’s room during the time I roomed with him. In my own room I have to keep things tidy, and in the living rooms I cannot stand a mess. I wonder if this has something to do with a feeling of ownership. In Caleb’s room I felt like I didn’t have a lot of stuff, and I could fit into his room with a place for everything (whether tidy or not, it was organized). Maybe the reason Deborah and mom are more comfortable with the mess downstairs because it’s their stuff.

## Bonanza: Don’t Lead Your Kids To The Gallows

 There’s an episode of an old western TV Show called Bonanza, in which a woman devoted her whole life to giving her boys the home and land she wanted for them. She and her sons robbed banks, held up stages, raided towns, and killed men to be able to buy the land she promised them. Eventually one of her boys was jailed and sentenced to the gallows. She seized and strung up five important townsmen, declaring if the town hung her boy, she would hang the five men, hoping to ransom them for her child. One of the hostages escaped and her boys went after him. A search party that was looking for the men happened to find the escaped hostage right as the woman’s boys were about kill him. Jumping off their horses behind the cover of a large tree, the posse opened fire on the felons and killed them. Upon hearing the news that her sons had been killed, leaving her powerless to free the remaining son headed for the gallows, all she could say, sobbing to her hand, was, “They’re dead, and now they’ll hang Harry, all because of me. What have I done?” Sometimes what a parent thinks is best for her children is the very enemy of her family. She wanted to give them the things of the world, but such a gift would only come at the expense of their souls. The greatest gift a parent can bestow on her children is raising them up in the way of the Lord, teaching them to deny the things of the world so they might attain the Treasure of heaven. We live in a culture that says, “Give, give, give to your children!” Every birthday, every Christmas, every phone upgrade and new fad, every meal for crying out loud—but none of that is really the best thing for them. Isn’t it ironic that we celebrate the person who was born on his birthday instead of the One who gave him life? Or that the mom who birthed her child gives to him, rather than he giving back to her? Or that we receive the things of the world on the day we celebrate the One who came to teach us to deny the things of the world? Or that we buy T-Shirts that say, “Not of this world,” which in itself conforms to the pattern of the world that loves in word and talk rather than in deed and truth (1 John 3:17-18)? Where does it stop? Celebrate God on your birthday and do something for your parents, give to the poor on Christmas, glorify God with the use of your phone, stop treating money as if you own it, set your mind on things above, bless the poor with your abundance, and remember God in all things.

#  So-called Feeling God

## Physical Senses Don’t Communicate Metaphysical Phenomenon

Encouragement is dangerous. We put so much emphasis on encouraging our students that we forget what we are encouraging them in. A man can be encouraged to do evil. We elevate our kids in the Lord rather than elevating the Lord in our kids. Paul said that boasting is necessary, but a certain kind of boasting.

Some people worry that because they cannot “feel” and “experience” God in moving ways they may not actually have the Holy Spirit. Yet in reality, any feelings I would worry is deception of the heart. There are at least eighteen basic ways we can come to information (sight, taste, touch, pressure, itch, thermoception (temperature), sound, smell, proprioception, tension sensors, nociception (pain), equilibrioception (balance), stretch receptors, chemoreceptors, thirst, hunger, magenotoceotion, time). The common definition of a sense is a system that consists of a group of sensory cell types that respond to a specific physical phenomenon and that corresponds to a particular group of regions within the brain where the signals are received and interpreted. These are the ways that we feel things in the physical world. None of these senses could possibly give you information of the Holy Spirit, who is in fact metaphysical. No one knows how we feel things in the Spiritual world, however. When someone says they “feel” the Holy Spirit moving, what do they mean? Can they see Him? Can they hear him? Do they have knowledge of Him from any of their senses? Probably that is not what they are talking about. Rather, what they are referring to is an epiphenomenon that occurs from interpreting the cause of group behavior to be the Holy Spirit. Or perhaps individually they are talking about a more personal sense. They sin against God, the radio broadcaster turns on a song about forgiveness, and suddenly the Holy Spirit is said to somehow be involved in the radio broadcaster’s decision to play that song. The problem is that you are elevating human council to Devine council. Confusing human wisdom with Devine wisdom.

## God’s Glory Radiates From The Bible

Many kids have told me with some word-choice contemplation that when they read their bible they feel God. We say that with hesitation because it doesn’t sound very compelling, as if we need to provide some deeper description of our experience with God. But there is a beauty in the simple testimony that we feel God. When I read the scriptures sometimes it’s like when you walk outside on a sunny day and close your eyes, you can’t see where the sun is but you can still tell where it is in the sky because you can feel it’s radiance on your face, when you open the bible sometimes you can feel this radiance of glory and majesty and you can’t help but “feel God.”

# Seek First The Kingdom Of God

## Life Is Busy And Samuel Is Late, But Wait For Samuel

In the book of 1 Samuel the Israelites went to Samuel and said, “Look, you’re getting old and your sons don’t walk in your ways. We want a king to judge us like everybody else.” This displeases Samuel but God tells him to do whatever they say because it isn’t Samuel they’re rejecting, it’s God. So Samuel warns them all that a king would entail and they say, “Yeah, that’s fine. We want a king.” So Samuel sets out to search for the person God wants to rule His people. It turns out to be a very handsome dude, a head taller than everyone else. The Lord anoints him ruler over His inheritance, and he was a great king. The Spirit of God came on Saul mightily, and he prophesied and was called among the prophets. Things were working really well. And then there was this battle between Israel and the Philistines, and Samuel was supposed to come and make some offerings to the Lord so that He would fight for them. So Saul waited seven days and said, “Forget this, I don’t have time for God’s prophet. I can do it myself. I need to win this battle, I need to succeed at life, I don’t have time to wait for God’s prophet. I’m a king and I’ve got responsibilities to my people, they want me to fight this battle, and some of them are scattering because I’ve waited this long, and if I wait too much longer and spend more time doing what God intended then the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal and I with all my people will be crushed. We will die if we don’t get on with things. I understand what God wants from me but I’m busy trying to make victory possible. I don’t have time.” And what ends up happening? Sure, they won the battle. But God takes his Spirit away from Saul, and gives him an evil Spirit from the Lord. In the end, God takes Saul’s kingdom away from him. Saul sacrificed his kingdom to win one battle that he would’ve won anyway if he only devoted his time to the Lord and not the battle. Don’t let the battles of life keep you from devoting yourself fully to the Lord. Because God, He’ll bless you in the battle; He’ll fight for you in the battle; He gives to the ones He loves even in their sleep. Don’t spend all of your efforts trying to keep up with life, in the business of the world. What good is it to gain the treasures of the world if it makes you miss out on the treasures of heaven? God’s Kingdom, Jesus prayed, would come and His will be done on earth as it is in heaven. C.S. Lewis said, “The joys of heaven are for most of us, in our present condition.” Don’t yield that joy to the business of life.

## We All Consider The After

Let’s say some magical fairy, or a genie, or someone comes to you and gives you two options from which you may choose one. You can have everything you want starting now for an entire year. Houses, cars, presidency, the latest technologies and fashions, anything, but at the end of the year, everything you have will be taken from you except the clothes on your back. You will be on the streets, no degree, no job, no driver’s license, no money, nothing. That’s option one. You can choose that, or you can have just enough to get by for the next year, but 365 days from now, after you’ve spent a year with basically nothing, you will have everything you want until the day that you die. What would you choose? Option two, right? Why? I mean, you could have everything you want right now. Sure, a year from now you’ll have nothing, but that’s a long time down the road; you won’t have to worry about that until it comes. Right now is what matters. Feel good and live in the moment. Anything you want until it’s taken from you. No, no that’s not how we think. We have an awareness of what happens after that year is over, don’t we? In the end, all of us, I think, care about things that last longer more than things that pass away very quickly. We choose option two. Why endure a year with nothing for a lifetime of everything you want? Because you’re looking to the prize. You have your eyes set on what happens after you endure. It’s worth it to give up one short year to gain the rest of your life. Everybody knows that! It’s obvious to us. We choose that which will last. My point is that all of us have an instinct in the way we rationalize that causes us to consider the after. We care about what happens after. It’s a good question to ask. Ask what happens after one drink? What happens after the test comes back positive? What happens after I don’t study? What happens after I get addicted? What happens after my money runs out? What happens after I can’t pay my bills? And these are all great questions to ask, but the one I think most of us tend to evade is the biggest one of them all, what happens after I die?

## Martha, Martha

 Martha, Martha-you’re drowning in the sea of things to do, troubled with many things, suffocating in your messy wealth. Only one thing is necessary, you’re worried about the dust, the dirt, the dishes, the mess, the food, the carpet, the papers on the table, the toys in the living room, the books on the desk, the grime on the windows, the grime on the mirrors, the toilet, the towels, what’s on the overpass, the way the pantry is organized, if the garage is too cluttered-Martha, Martha, only one thing is necessary: just let me in.

#  Why Read The Bible? (Or At All)

## The Bible Is A Window, Not A Portrait

 Bible study is not about its application to _your_ life mainly. It’s about equipping the believer to go out into Jerusalem, our home, and into Samira and the ends of the earth to show people the eternal salvation of our Lord Jesus Christ. Bible study is not about understanding the Bible as a map to guide each step we take through our own lives, to just direct the outcome of our decisions mainly, it’s about preparing the ourselves to give an answer to anyone who asks for the hope that he have in Jesus. It’s about understanding who God is; it’s about seeking the revelation of God to us in His word. In Genesis God appears to Abraham by the Word of the Lord. Abraham sees God by the hearing of His Word. The Bible is not just a rulebook to show us the law; the law is only a tutor to get us to Christ, Paul says in Galatians 3:24, and when we have Christ, we don’t even need the tutor anymore he says. Don’t make Bible study about its application to things that we do mainly. God gave us the Bible to be enjoyed, so that we could know Him more fully and delight in Him more completely.

## Reading Will Save You Years Of Your Life

Reading is a means of building upon the work of others. It’s a means of progress because we don’t need to spend 10 years pondering a subject that somebody else wrote a book about. What if people were immortal, and fully conscious? Imagine what people like Sir Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, Aristotle, and others would have accomplished by now if they were still alive. Reading is a means of immortality. Einstein’s work is being thought about by people who are using it to further our understanding of the universe. We don’t have to start at square one because of information that gets transferred from one person’s mind to a younger person’s mind. The car would never have been invested if not for the wheel. We build upon each other’s accomplishments in creativity, ideology, discovery, and so much more. Reading is the agent of progress. One person’s ideas being transferred to another person in order to build upon those ideas and transfer them to another person to do the same thing.

## Go To The Manuel

I once heard a janitor say, “If all else fails, go to the manual.” This is how we men think, isn’t it? “I can figure it out on my own!” I submit to you, brothers, that there will be people who accomplish more with less effort because they went to the manual. Somewhere along the lines it became un-masculine to go to the manual. That is why sometimes men can tinker with their cars for hours while the women can do it in the time that it takes to read the manual and do what it says.

What if we went to the scriptures to learn how to live before we tried “doing it ourselves?” Maybe there would be complaining. Maybe we would see extreme poverty go down. Maybe we would be a generation that rises up.

## “You cannot love someone you don’t understand.”

 One night as our family was finishing our day with nightly devotions, we read, memorized scripture, prayed, and then began singing. When we starting this portion of our routine, Brian left a normal disinterested expression. I suppose he thought of prayer as the object of commencing events and concluding them. With the displeasure his face normally insinuated in having to come downstairs for devotions, I thought to myself, “He is truly lacking delight in God. He does not find his joy is anything spiritual.” Later as I was watching _Once Upon A Time_, the evil ice queen said to Emma, “You cannot love someone you don’t understand.” As I went to the bathroom I thought more about Brian’s attitude toward corporate (and individual) worship. I realized I am him in some senses. I too often lack the delight in God I long for. Then the ice queen’s saying came to mind. “You cannot love someone you don’t understand.” If you don’t love God, spend more time in His word and more time praying.

#  A Rose By Any Other Name…What About A Carrion Flower By The Name Of A Rose?

## Is Yahweh Allah known by a different name?

What separates Yahweh from Allah? Both are one and only, both are supreme, neither can be seen, both are holy and both created the universe. Why do we say Muslims and Christians worship different God’s if they are the same in character and only different in name? The reason is that Yahweh is love and Allah only loves those who first loved him. The difference is that Allah expects you to be made holy from the outside by your works, while Yahweh makes you holy from within by His spirit. The difference is what we believe about God; our doctrine.

# Pride: Seeking Men’s Praise Before God’s Praise

## Lessons From Life: I Sought To Impress People

There was a time when I had set my mind to a family revolution within my house hold. At this point I had already experienced the joy of God and tasted the fruit of his Spirit, but during the summer of 2014 my walk was darkened by trading my personal time with God for retreats and mission trips to engage in church community. The fruit of my bearing slowly turned bitter, and little by little my spirituality became something to impress people with. I would conjure up the scriptures I knew along with theological arguments and apologetics in an impressive display of what I was good at: Christianity. When we perform in order to be encouraged by other church members, or when we are only driven by the encouragement of other church members, we say to God that He is not sufficient for our infinite joy, not effective enough to pray to, not easy enough to listen to, and ultimately that He is not the treasure for which we use church as a means to obtain more fully, but rather the He is a means for which we desire encouragement from other members.

## Lessons From Life: I Made Community Essential

Your spirituality should never depend on other people. The fruit that comes from the vine is contingent on nothing except the vine. The fruit isn’t our responsibility. It’s not our fruit, it’s Jesus’ fruit. It’s the vine that sends its nutrients to the branches. My problem was that I elevated family Bible study to the dependent variable of my abidance and fruit bearing of God. The problem with that is that my family is not like me. I can’t use my intellectual arguments to make someone love God. When I tried, it became aggressive and what I maintained in calmness was not commensurate with the harshness of my words. I felt terrible. I basically questioned Caleb’s faith for the sake of persuading him to support family Bible study. Fear is an easy tactic of persuasion, but it is a fooling council.

What finally made all this click was two passages: One of them where Paul describes the various functions of the body. The eye cannot say to the hand, “You are less than me if you will not become like me.” Every body part is different, and thank God for it because if the hand was like the eye the body could not function as it does. The other is in 1 Peter 3, when he tells wives to bring faith into the household, yet without saying a word. “In the same way, you wives, be submissive to your own husbands so that even if any of them are disobedient to the word, they may be won without a word by the behavior of their wives, as they observe your chaste and respectful behavior.”

## Moments Are Meant To Be Captured, They’re Meant To Be Lived

If the wind is consistent there is a large company of small white petals blowing through the air and bristling along the walk. - it isn’t folly to take a picture, but to behold the picture and miss the trees you are walking through is the mistake of fools. It doesn’t due to sacrifice the real on behalf of the fake; the diamond on behalf of the imitation.

## Lessons From Life: Fake Facebook Glory

 There was a time I can remember that I consorted to create a number of fake Facebook pages in order to add “likes” to the various doctrine and spiritual things I had been storing for my statuses. Setting up these accounts and learning how to bypass mobile security took time and effort, of which I spent countless hours achieving when I was in high school, in 2012. After I succeeded whenever I logged in as another account I would stumble on to the equivalent of pornography on Facebook and thus was convicted to no longer access these accounts. I left it behind. But in 2015 I never added my new college friends to Facebook because I didn’t want them to see how few friends I had and virtually no statuses because no one would like them. So I went back to creating these accounts. My old method no longer worked, so I spent a good portion of two days learning a new method and created a few accounts, with the ambition of making many more. I had a perfect process of organization for all of these accounts linked and hyperlinked to all the information, pictures, etc. that I needed to make them look real. Again, I became victim to the temptations entailed with creating forged accounts. Further than that, this time I was more aware of the other side of the coin: the time I spent on it took away from the time I spent of things of greater priority. I felt convicted in my heart to stop, but couldn’t identify the cause of the conviction as absolutely from God rather than simply the feeling of wasted time, so I asked God to make it clear to me whether I should cease the pursuit of this project or not. After all, this project is what would give me confidence to start making statuses of spiritual nature. On my walk I kept praying, but felt as if He would not answer me this time around. As I was walking through an archway of trees, seeing the petals blowing through the wind and in the street, this judgement entered my mind:

_If the wind is consistent there is a large company of small white petals blowing through the air and bristling along the walk. It isn’t folly to take a picture, but to behold the picture and miss the trees you are walking through is the mistake of a fool. It doesn’t due to sacrifice the real on behalf of the fake; the diamond on behalf of the imitation._

I took that as a message of permissible caution, and continued forging these fake accounts. More time wasted, more temptations carrying me away, and more remorse for what I was doing lead to another walk across from Collin College. This time it entered my mind that, “I’m using something for my courage other than God.” It made so much sense to me, it became clear that I was missing the mark, or “sinning.” Using something else as a substitute for what only God can fulfill seemed to me the very essence of sin, and I was surely doing that with my endeavor to make my wisdom appear noticed by many. Then I convinced myself that I wasn’t doing it to look noticed, but to be noticed and further God’s teachings, and to inspire. I probably wouldn’t post a status without insurance of “likes,” and therefore this was a tool to get my doctrine out there, saying the first word in conversations about God’s Kingdom. Finally, the next day, I took a shower, and remembered that Paul counted all things as loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ. It occurred to me that the small in this life are great in the next, and the great in this life are small in the next. If I would only post a status to appear great, I make myself smaller in God’s Kingdom. This was an act of earth, not an act of the Spirit. This time I realize if I pursue fake recognition, not only to I live a pseudo-greatness in this life, I lose out on eternal things as well. I’m not willing to spend my time for this small temporal period of life, I don’t live for the earth; I live for Heaven.

# Apologetics & Evangelism

## Dear Dr. Wilkison: Agents Of Free Will

 If you can make decisions outside of nature (understand that you are acting outside of natural government, nature isn’t determining what you choose), you are by definition a miracle. During our class last semester you emphasized repeatedly the power of culture, but then you turned around and said that we are not pieces of driftwood just going wherever the currents take us. You seemed to subscribe to a certain philosophy called agency, in which human beings are not pieces of driftwood going wherever the current leads, but rather entities which make decisions for ourselves, acting as agents independently of the universal constants and arbitrary quantities that govern all the matter and chemical processes in our universe.

There is a model form a chemistry which defines how the potassium breads in our brain stick together, which essentially is what causes our neurons to fire, which is what defines how we think, meaning that we aren’t agents that act independently of natural law, but every decision we make is just chemical reactions. If there is any part of human beings which makes decisions independently of nature, it must be spirituality. If it is physicality, you are not an agent. The universe destined you to make every choice you have and will ever make. If there is no spirituality, can you justify agency? Acting outside the realm of what nature determines? If we aren’t willing to unsubscribe to the philosophy of agency, we are faced with justifying spirituality. If we don’t hold to agency, it doesn’t matter what you choose because frankly, you don’t choose; the universe chooses. The model form of chemistry chooses. A man’s choice to rape was a chemical reaction. A man’s choice to murder is a chemical reaction. He isn’t bad, there was nothing else he could have done. If he isn’t an agent, he can’t be responsible and justice therefore, along with morality, is a lie. It would be untruthful to say any given person is wrong in their actions; it was the universe’s actions. You are not a person, understand, you are just a small part of the universe. Part of the universe acts one way, part of it acts another, but neither could be wrong. Justice is simply untruthful. Our system of justice is wrong for fighting against natural order. Yet this is contradictory because our system of justice emerged from natural order. Without agency, everything falls apart. Believing that you are not responsible for your decisions, that you have no one to answer to, can lead to serious philosophical consequences that can cause a man to make “wrong” choices. If nature determines it, there is no such thing as a unique person. If nature determines it, there is no responsibility. But if spirituality determines it, that means that miracles do, in fact, exist, which begs a whole new set of question of what happens after we die. If we exist outside of physicality, the loss of our physical bodies will not cease our existence. There’s more to us than that.

## Your Body Has More Information that you do / Applied Kinesiology

What is the principle that determines whether information is conscious or unconscious? Because your body knows the truth; somewhere in your gray cells is all the information you have ever worked to access or tried to remember. What if your whole life is recorded inside your mind? And more than that, what if we could learn to control what information we can access, and how to organize it so it doesn’t get jumbled up? Learning would explode. Scientific, technological, and academic advancements would take off into a world that would resemble the place where someone who dies at 100 years of age is counted accursed. Contained within the mysteries of the mind could be the difference in the world that we all desperately need.

## Civilization Is Devolving Us

Is civilization so much better than nature? Look at what nature can do! Civilization attempts to make people more comfortable, but when our bodies don’t consume natural produce, natural water, natural air, and function as it ought, we lose aptitude.

## “Christians Should Keep Their Religion To Themselves”

 But how do you define religion? Isn’t religion, in essence, a set of beliefs with which your actions are based? So that means everyone does have a set of ﻿beliefs. Saying you don’t believe in anything is in itself a belief. So when you say that Christians should keep their religions to themselves, aren’t you essentially shoving your own view to them?

## Life As We Don’t Know It

Life can only exist as we know it. If otherwise, why no life on every other planet? Life should be in that case ever evolving to meet planetary conditions, but we see it surviving only with the conditions of earth. If evolution, we need not worry about the condition of our planet. . . . We will simply evolve to match it.

## Your Body Knows More Than You Do / Applied Kinesiology

I first learned about sex when I was twelve. I was going to a church event that the theme involved sexuality, and my parents thought I needed to know before going to that event. So they told me and it blew my mind. I hadn’t had a clue, it was like everything makes sense now! But what’s interesting is I can recall years before that, as early as five years old, I lusted after women. I remember walking through Wal-Mart by the checkout where the magazines of all the sexy models and celebrities were, and as we would walk by I would get an erection. I didn’t know what it was back then, I wasn’t even aware that my coconut tree was hard or abnormal, I just knew I didn’t like; it was uncomfortable, pushing against my little pants, pressing against my zipper. So here I am, years before I knew about sex, and my body was preparing me for it. How could my body be aware of something that I had no consciousness of? My body was communicating information that I didn’t have. How can this be? I didn’t know what sex was. I didn’t know about masturbation or organisms or any kind of sexual pleasure, and yet I remember Princess Leia in Star Wars episode VI, and I bought a Lego set that had a picture of her in the slave outfit on the back, and I would look at it with a flashlight under my bed. Where did that desire come from? Why did I want to see her naked? It’s like we have these natural instincts that we have no consciousness of, but are just there. What is enticing about a naked girl to a boy who has no sexual awareness, and therefore also no sexual intentions? I want to see her naked because. . . .? Clothes are concealers, they cover things to keep them hidden. Uncovering something secret, something new and fresh is a novel experience, but I don’t think that’s the primal reason for lust.

## Metaphors Of Genesis: Naked = Without Robe Of Righteousness?

 When God cursed woman at the fall of man, he _increased_ the pain of childbirth. Increased it from what? Most likely from what it already was, indicating that childbirth was already a thing prior to Adam and Eve _realizing_ they were naked. How could this be? Unless the word naked doesn’t mean “without clothes on,” but something more profoundly meaningful, like some extrinsic form of shame associated with their nakedness. Could naked mean “without law,” for example? Or perhaps they realized the potential of evil in nakedness through the avenue of lust that would later plague mankind.

## Metaphors Of Genesis: Knowledge Destroys Relationships

 I used to spend a good long while studying theology. What’s God like? What’s good and what’s evil? And then I realized that the first sin was Adam and Eve trying to attain knowledge of good and evil. That knowledge was the very thing that disrupted the shalom in the garden paradise. Sometimes it’s our knowledge that gets in the way of intimacy with God.

## Tools Of Rhetoric

 One of the tools of rhetoric are these devices we use to symbolically relate to something more applicable, something larger. First I’ll explain that leprosy symbolizes sin, and instead of asking what the sin is in your life, I can now ask what the leprosy is in your life.

## Did The Triune God Create Math?

Are mathematical truths a created property of the universe, or did they pre-exist the beginning? I think they pre-existed the beginning, because the Trinitarian God has no beginning. Three in one deals with numbers.

## A Glass Of Muddied Water Cannot Be Filled With Wine

Jesus said that when we are brought before rulers the Holy Spirit will teach us at that time what to say. He doesn’t say we will know ahead of time, and that’s the annoying part, He said we will know at that time. See we all like to know ahead of time and we worry about what to say so we spend all this time preparing, but Jesus said no, don’t do that. See, when we figure it out and have in our minds what we are going to say before we engage, there is no room left for the Holy Spirit to teach us what to say, and so we use our words instead of His words. We don’t like having to trust God in the moment with what to say, so we fill up on human wisdom. No, no, no, friends, the commission is reserved for the Spirit. Sometimes the words you would use to win an argument aren’t the words God would use to change a life.

# Porn

## Confession Interview At CCBC

During my time interviewing students as a leader at Cottonwood Creek Baptist Church, the first sin every student seemed comfortable confessing was cursing. There were no students who didn’t confess to that. After encouraging them not to respond right away, but to take a minute to evaluate themselves before God, not because we aren’t already aware of our sin but because it takes a minute to evaluate the situation and what you are comfortable sharing, setting the framework for confession, most students had a common sin that they shared after some time in thought: pornography. It made me wonder, what is it that makes pornography more difficult to confess than cursing? Everybody knows they are both sin, what makes one more shameful than the other?

## The Irony Of “Adult” Content

 Isn’t it ironic that we call debauched things “adult” content not suited for kids as if kids know better and adults don’t. . . . It would be like saying the older you get the less responsible you can be with your finances.

## The Carrot And The Twinkie

The carrot does not in that moment draw me away from the Twinkie by virtue of greater immediate pleasure. My desire to be healthy is a greater desire than my desire for a Twinkie, but it isn’t greater in that moment. I don’t choose the carrot because it’s so glorious that it just makes the Twinkie unappealing, I choose the carrot because I have my eyes set on something greater than what will please me the most at that moment.

Pornography wires your brain to keep coming back even without your permission. There are certain levels of consciousness vigilance that cannot overcome the impulses of your mind. Dopamine is a drug, a real chemical that is released in crazy disproportionate amounts during masturbation, and your brain needs it to function properly. When you say it didn’t feel like your choice, because you hate it and would do anything to overcome it, you are right. It isn’t your choice, it was your choice, and those choices of innocence stripped you of your freedom after you knew better. We better hope that God can sympathize with our weakness and be gracious to us, having mercy on us.

## Draw The Before You Step Across It

I think the reason so many kids are subjugated by pornography is that they don’t know where to draw the line of what lust is. They can recognize sexual fantasies about people as lust but they wouldn’t think twice about merely being pleased with the image of a girl passing by or on Facebook who isn’t explicitly stimulating sexual thought. They don’t recognize gazing at a fully clothed friend of theirs as lust. The truth is when Jesus warned against lusting after women he used the word epithumeó, which can mean to “show focused passion as it aptly builds on what a person truly yearns for,” to “set your heart upon,” to “gaze upon with satisfaction.” So I’m watching Smallville and a perfectly modest scene with Lana comes on, and I’m satisfied with her modest beauty, so I look at Lana instead of Clark or Chloe—that’s lust. I enjoy the image of another person and channel that enjoyment to self-gratification instead of God’s glorification. That’s lust. It’s not sexual, it’s “I’m looking upon this mountain because it is pleasing to my eyes to behold this mountain, so I will esteem this mountain because it allows me to feel good.”

## We Put The Law On Steroids

It’s important that we don’t distort God’s commandments to conveniently suit our doctrine. We take what Jesus said about looking at a woman to lust after her and elevate the word look to the more convicting verb of thinking. Have we forgot Eve’s folly, adding to God’s one command “Do not eat of the tree,” “Do not even touch it”? Is that what God said? Perhaps if she had listened more wisely to God’s way her foot might not have been caught in the quick sand of doubt. What Jesus said, I think, can be candidly applied to pornography (I’m looking at the naked image of a woman to satisfy sexual titillation), but not masturbation. Masturbation doesn’t look at a woman to lust after her. Now I generally go with a different approach to answering their problem of masturbation or pornography than throwing the law at them. Most kids are only willing to confess that indwelling sin in their lives if they are already convicted that it’s wrong. That being said, what I would ask is the question, “Does masturbation commit pornia in a man’s heart?” Pornia is the word Jesus used in the Matthew 5 passage, and can mean adultery, fornication, or any sexual gratification. Hebrew has a small number of words in its language to articulate a very wide range of meaning. For anything of sexual nature, they would use the word pornia. If it does, then it’s wrong, because pornia is wrong in the Torah. That aside, be transformed by the renewal of your mind to discern what the will of God is in every situation.

## Lions Will Maul You If You Open Your Window

In 2015 there was a young woman driving through a South African lion park who rolled down her window when they approached a lion. When the seemingly harmless lions of lust and desire and self-gratification come roaming by your stand, remember this woman and keep your windows up! Don’t interact with this beast!? Keep them up! She looks cute, cuddly, friendly, but as soon as you put that window up she will strike you where you sit! When we’re driving through the world we’re going to see a lot of lions on our way, but Satan “prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour” (1 Peter 5:8).

## Put Down The Drink Or The Drink Will Put You Down

Pornography is the new narcotic. It makes its victims chronically drunk. Don’t think you’re at the top of your potential—you’re barely operating. It’s time to put down the drink and restore your mind to be the best that it can be. I’m not sober, and with blood in my eyes and a thorn in my sanity, through clouded thoughts I do my best to put down the drink. I search for a life that can see with eyes so clear, hear the sounds of a Word so powerful it divides the soul from the marrow.

## Don’t Climb The Mountain For You

There is a story of a valuable treasure, a golden medallion available for the taking to any man you could grab it. It lay at the top of an eagle’s nest, high and difficult to reach. So a man set out to climb the canyon, terrified of heights. As he neared a certain peak, his fear would let him go no farther, and he climbed down. Day after day he set out again to reach the medallion, and day after day his fear frustrated him. “I’m a grown man!” He shouted. “Why can’t I do this?” One day he was so frustrated and messed up by his fear that he jumped off and died. His fear of falling caused so much frustration that he actually jumped off. What was he afraid of? Not dying, he jumped off in relief. He wanted to end his frustration. He never made it to the treasure because he let his fear of falling drive him to an act of desperation.

Another man was climbing to reach his stranded child. He overcame his fear and reached the child. One man climbed to inherit a treasure for himself, another man climbed to save somebody else.

## Pray Or Preach? Do Or Be?

 If a man has intended to spend time with God on a given morning, vowing that after he showers his day will be spent in prayer and reading, but while he is showering thinks of some perfect illustrations and parables that will relate to someone he is counselling, what will he do after he is done showering? If he redirects his thoughts and attention to God for several hours, he will more than likely forget his counsel. But he vowed. If he spends his time with God first, his efforts to remember what it is he thought of in the shower would likely hinder his full devotion and attention to God. A man of God would pray. Ask God to clear his mind from any distracting thoughts that will impede his time in scripture and prayer, and when his set time is complete that God would put back into his mind the thoughts he offered up, yet filtered and refined by the Word of the Most High.

## People Like It When You Praise Them, Not Yourself

 Going through old messages, the ones that really made me appreciate somebody more was not when they spoke of how great they were, but the ones that said, “Keep your room! I like being there.” Or “dude ethan your just flippen awesome idk why though you just are” “im signed up for YYLC now WOO HOO” “YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YYLC!” it’s gonna be beyound epic!

## Junk Food Has A Higher Price Than The Money You Spend On It

 “How much did all of this junk food cost you?” “About $145. . . . !!! Wait stop! Why would you throw that out?” “I figured all this food has cost you too much already, but compared to what it was about to cost you what you paid was nothing.”

## Lone Star Tarnished Research

In America 92 percent of Anglos have their high school diploma. That number is 86 percent for Blacks and 60 percent for Hispanics. Average wage for Anglos is $78,388, while average wage is $44,282 for Blacks and $41,151 for Hispanics. Jobs that pay more depend on how much you have learned, or in some cases are able to learn, about things that other people discovered. As society advances the tools people use to produce things advances. It isn’t because Hispanics are Hispanic that their wage is so much lower. It isn’t because the jobs they have need to be filled. The difference between a high paying job and a low paying job is education (not to be confused with schooling). In other words, if the percentage of Hispanics that graduate high school increases, the average Hispanic wage will be commensurate with that increase. What happens to society? Hispanics start taking on more advanced jobs, producing more efficiently, taking in more income, all beginning with education. The more you know, the more you can do, and the more resourcefully you can do it. It all traces back to building on the work of other people. If in 20 years Anglos are only 28 percent of Texas, wages decrease, but what happened to those jobs? They disappeared because there weren’t enough people capable of doing them. In other words the potential of job wages, and the type of jobs created and offered is relative to the knowledge, information, education, awareness, familiarity with the evolution of innovation that people have. Familiarity with the things people have discovered, thought about, invented, unraveled, etc. is what qualifies a person for a high paying job.

50 percent of jobs open in Dallas today require a BA, and only 30 percent of people living in the Dallas area have a BA; there is a mismatch between what jobs are requiring and the educational attainment that people have

## Unity Can Impede Alliance

The greatest alliance I’ve been a part of, second to the Luke-Ethan combo, was Brian and I staying as far away from each other as possible. I stay on my side and he stays on his side, and if we happen to cross paths we kill each other, but other than that we’re good. He once got thrown to my side and traveled below, jumping on my platform only out of necessity and passed through as quickly as his character could move. Other times he got thrown to my side I jumped to the other side out of preservation.

## Health Is More Than The Shape You’re In

I want to redefine health here. God did not intend God to be a median of survival. Jesus compared the word of God to daily food. Do we abide in His word daily to stay in the state we are in? No, the writer of Hebrews says this: you ought to be teachers by now, but still need the elementary principles of the faith. God intends His word to progress us, to advance us, to bear fruit in us. Food is intended not merely to keep us from starving, but to progress us and advance us. He fools himself who says his mind and philosophy is not correlated to the body. When people go running, many say it can turn a bad day into a good day. If one or two people with the same weight, muscle mass and shape, but one is eating right while the other is not, do they share the same health? We would referring to an internal state of health. Why don’t people take steroids more? It makes their shape better, doesn’t it? Jerry has chemicals in his body and is in great shape while Fred is all natural and fat. I would prefer to be in Jerry’s situation. The question is, what intrinsic quality or significance do the chemicals have? Does it affect Jerry’s health or mind or not? In the garden of Eden there were two kinds of fruit: there was fruit that gave life and there was fruit that brought death. We are still confronted with these two options every day: shall we eat for the purpose of life or for the purpose of death?

## Pain Is Your Friend

Would you rather, sit on a train, dance in the rain, or, feel no pain? Dance in the rain for me—pain is not your advisory, pain is your friend; it lets you know when things are not right. Without it he would touch burning stoves until our skin was turned black and our hands no longer function.

## Which would you rather be if you had the choice--divinely beautiful or dazzlingly clever or angelically good?

Dazzlingly clever is not gain. The serpent in Eden was clever, more crafty than all the other animals, yet he was cursed because of it. So cleverness can be either a blessing or a curse depending on whether or not it is governed by angelic goodness. But angelic goodness isn’t about what you gain, it’s about what you give, and when all things are loss to you, you gain a treasure that surpasses any blessings are curses-you gain Christ, hallelujah. We are by God creatures of divinity. We are not driftwood flowing wherever the current leads, we transcend nature-we are divine, and by his fingerprints divinely beautiful. Surely he made some ugly and without beauty, for it is he who makes the blind to never see, and the mute to never speak, surely it is He also who makes the ugly without beauty. I don’t know.

## What Caused Racism?

What caused racism? I don’t think kids are born into the world with an inherent hatred for different ethnicity. We have videos of me as a 3-year-old playing with my black cousins. There was no disregard for skin color, they were just family. Which leads me to believe that racism is something we are taught. If racism isn’t inherent to us, where did it start? Who taught the first teacher white supremacy?

## The law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless

If we were angels we wouldn’t need a constitution. The constitution is there to make sure the paradigms of culture don’t get out of whack, yet the document is itself a product of culture. It is a paradigm of culture in itself.

## Study By A Window

I see the lighting and think, “that’s the power of God.” We see God in the things He made; we see ourselves in the things we make. When you are trapped in the work of man, open the window to feel God’s work in your room. My window is a window to God’s fingerprints. I don’t want to just see it, I want to feel it and embrace it and experience it.

## If You Were In Eden, Would You Have Picked The Fruit?

I hear a lot of people make the bold presumption that if it were anyone else in the Garden of Eden they would’ve made the same decision to eat from the forbidden tree as Adam and Eve. This fails to address the knowledge that we already have. If I, being all that I am now, were put in that story of Genesis, the snake would not deceive me because I already know how the story ended. Remember that the snake deceived Eve. If she had known all that would happen, that death would enter the world (or if she had believed God when He told them they would surely die on that day), she probably wouldn’t have taken from the tree. I doubt anyone in this room would’ve taken from the tree knowing that the serpent was deceiving us, which we all would if we, being all that we are, were put in that story.

## The Watchman Who Does Not Warn Will Bear his Guilt

It seems to me that between Balaam, James, and other diviners, if a man comes on the name of the Lord saying, “thus says the Lord, you will not be judged for this,” the sin of those who listen to him will be visited upon the diviner because the men are with excuse.

## You Have No Covering Before God But From Christ

 Every now and then when you pray, when nobody’s around, remove your clothes. I think many of us might feel strange and awkward coming before God without our most basic coverings. Truly, I doubt it is of any significant to God whether or not we are clothed in the body before Him. He can see our bodily nakedness, I’m sure, but I believe he sees a nakedness that is way beyond the body, a profound nakedness that we aren’t always aware of in our prayer life, as if we were infants just born and unaware that we lack clothing. A nakedness that is significant to God. A nakedness that instead of lacking clothes we lack righteousness. That kind of nakedness is too profound to always keep on our minds because the truth is we don’t feel that sense of nakedness. Nobody else in the universe can see that. Everybody is blind to itit. It’s naturally covered to everyone except God. We don’t feel that kind of nakedness, so sometimes it’s good to uncover our body so that we can feel naked (as we are) and transpose that feeling of bodily nakedness to spiritual nakedness. I know in my own life as I grew up I would have been very uncomfortable to pray unencumbered, because if I were to be seen naked by anyone else it would be a shameful experience. Sometimes the concept is of spiritual nakedness is to great to understand that it doesn’t dawn on us. It takes evaluation to realize it. Sometimes it’s good to step back and remove the garment of cloth to remember that God sees you without the garment of righteousness, just as it is sometimes good to drink wine and break bread to remember that communion with God comes through the body and blood of Christ. They would see me for all that I am, but there are parts of me I need

It is like a child whose lost his clothes and is too embarrassed to be seen naked by his father, but his father is the only one who can give him new clothes.

because the way I relate to God in my doctrine is as though I rely on Him to clothe me in His righteousness, but all too often the way I relate to God in real life is as though I have a garment of my own, and if I were to be seen by Him without that garment it would be a shameful experience. Don’t rely on your own garment to experience a relationship with God, it’s just filthy rags anyway that do you no better than if you were naked. Come to God in all that you are and He will give you that garment. You can never be shamed with His wardrobe.

I don’t think God sees our nakedness and says, “Oh man, that guy is white! She has small breasts! He has way too much hair down there!” God is familiar with your body; he fashioned it. Every sequence of our DNA was His idea. When He looks at us, the nakedness He sees is on a deeper level. He sees us totally as we are. He looks at us and knows that secret sin that we did and nobody else knows about. He looks at all of our righteousness, and see our flawed heart behind it. We are all naked before the eyes of God, and we all have something we wish was covered up.

## Jesus Cup Was Death

If you believe Jesus drank the wrath of God in the cup which He was asking if it were possible that the Father pass from Him, you must also believe that James and John drank the cup of the wrath of God, for Jesus said that they would drink the same cup that He did (Mark [10:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5Rbo3_TpK8&t=10m35s)-40).

## Jesus Introduction

A long time ago there was this man named Jesus, and there was something un-normal about this guy, see, He was born from a virgin. A woman who had never had sexual relations with anyone brought this Son into the world. It’s almost as if the universe needed Him. And this Son grew in stature and in wisdom and in favor with man and favor with God, and so by the time He’s twelve years old His parents found Him teaching the leaders of their culture. And they listened to Him. That’s how incredible this guy was. Old men, respected men, wise men, elders would listen to Him at twelve years old. And He was about thirty, He said this:

## Conversation Advice For Caleb

 It is a mistake to think one can get through a healthy conversation without mustering up some interest in the counterpart’s contributions. If you don’t know anything about what she’s talking about, ask questions. If you know a little bit, conjure up some thoughts. Don’t be contentious, don’t be non-sequitur. Relationships are affirmed by concurrence. It’s important that you don’t signal vibes of disinterest. “I hear you but I don’t care.” Blank silence says I don’t care. Silence should never be coupled with effortless eye contact. Silence is only permitted if your eyes show you to be in a state of cognition.

# Laodicea

##  Sin Comes From Treasuring Something Other Than God

Every time we sin we say to God, “You are not sufficient for my ultimate happiness and satisfaction and pleasure.” So what does it mean to say, “I am rich and in need of nothing,” when in reality you are “poor, blind pitiful and naked”? It is to build a cistern that competes with the true Fountain, drawing water from it thinking it is better than the Fountain when in reality it is a broken cistern that will never be sufficient for your ultimate happiness, pleasure and satisfaction. It’s not a question of your hope being fully set on the grace to be given you, he didn’t say “I need nothing for salvation,” it was a remark about needing nothing for treasure. I am rich, I need nothing more to be satisfied. Not “I am righteous, I need nothing more to be saved.”

## Do You Know God?

Witnessing to Christians -- My experience of the church growing up had God and people separated into two events. Sometimes I wonder how many of us really know God, how many of us have His spirit manifested in us, do we seek him. We need to examine ourselves to recognize Christ in us, and listen for his spirit bearing witness to ours that we’re children of God. We need to be witnesses of God goodness and greatness and majesty to anyone who doesn’t know about it. My fear is that many of us don’t know God on a real, personal, prayerful, level.

# Music

## Yelling At God

I can remember a time – a season of times – where I was just yelling at God. I don’t remember what exactly I was saying: “Where is Your salvation?” “Why am I still in my sins?” “Look at me! I’m a slave!” “Where are You?” “Why won’t you respond?” “You never respond!” “I don’t know you that well but I can tell that you aren’t hearing me! The God I know about would send fire from heaven against me for saying the things I’m saying to You!” “Why aren’t I dead?”

## Modern Christians Songs Are Mainly About Us

One time I just really wanted praise God, and sing to Him about how great he is; I didn’t want to sing about how he loves me, I wanted to sing about how I love Him, I didn’t want to focus on the cross, or my sins, I didn’t want to sing _about_ God, I wanted to sing _to_ God. So I made a playlist and went searching through my songs and found a very small proportion of Christian music puts the emphasis to God’s glory.

# Hell

## Death And Hades Thrown Into Hell… What About The People In Them?

In Revelation, I find it interesting that it says _death_ and _hades_ were thrown into hell, yet never says the people _in_ them were thrown into hell. As a matter of further interest, I have never found anywhere that _explicitly_ says “people will be thrown into the lake of fire at judgment day,” except that the soul who sins will die, and Paul says those without belief are perishing. And that Jesus said many will try for the narrow gate, but few will find it. None of this is conclusive, however, only implicit.

# The Problem Of God’s Sovereignty And Evil / Freewill

## You Are Not Smart Enough To Rap Battle Jesus

Remember how the apostles selected their replacement for Judas Iscariot? They cast lots. “The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from the Lord.” How much do you trust in God’s sovereignty? Those dice do not roll without his permission, his notice, or outside of his authority. That lightning bolt induced by the electric charges of frozen raindrops bumping into each other [offset energy of the earth’s magnetic field] doesn’t strike any place by chance; it’s God. Sometimes we think too hard about, in reality, non sequitur contradictions about God. It’s good to question what people say about Him, but ultimately we must go to the Scriptures for truth, not our logic. There were some Sadducees (who don’t believe in the resurrection) who went to Jesus with a theological contradiction about the resurrection. They said, “In the law of Moses if a man dies his brother must marry his wife. There was a man who was one of seven brothers. He died so one of his brothers married his wife. The second brother died, so a third brother married her. Then he died, and all of the seven brothers married her and died the same way. Finally the woman died. Who will be her husband in the resurrection?” That’s a very profound question. Who will it be? I can’t really think my way around that one. But Jesus didn’t look at them and say, “Oh, you’re good! Got me on this one. There really must not be a resurrection.” No, He said, “You fools! Theirs is no marriage in the resurrection!” The problem with their argument is that it induces a kind of logic that says, “If a phenomenon cannot fulfil my expectations of it, then it doesn’t exist.” An example would be, “God would make it more evident that he exists if He actually existed. Therefore, he doesn’t exist.” The premise here is a logical fallacy because it supposes that God must meet the arguer’s expectation of Him for God to exist, without giving thought to whether or not it is the arguer’s expectations that is misplaced in the first. The Sadducees came to Jesus with a scenario that leaves them without anything to expect. Will her husband be the first one, the last one, her favorite one, the most upright one? The point of the argument is, “There is no way in my understanding to make it fair at the resurrection,” and therefore it is a paradox of justice. “If I can’t come to terms, within my capacity of understanding, with my expectations for an object, that object must not be possible.” It neglects what’s outside of your understanding. There’s a piece of missing information, and to assert that you have enough information to declare the things of God, I feel, is terribly arrogant. There is an answer, but it took _Jesus_ to answer it. You want to know the answer? Pray about it and go to the Scriptures.

# Missions And Poverty

## My Phone Bill Could Feed 40 Kids

Summer 2015, it started to bother me that my Dad could feed a hungry child somewhere in the world with the money that he spends to keep this phone in my pocket. “But I need my phone to find people when I get lost. But I need my phone for my work. But I need my phone to contact people.” No, the truth is people survived without phones for a very long time. And then I started thinking about the money I had been budgeting toward an external hard drive to back up my files. It would cost $130 to backup all of my 5 terabytes of storage--money that could be put toward providing clean water to a community who doesn’t have it. I could trust God to keep my files save instead of an external hard drive and put that money toward the poor. How is it permissible for us to climb up Maslow’s hierarchy when so many around the world aren’t living in conditions that satisfy the first level? And then it came to mind when Mary poured a forty-five-thousand-dollar bottle of perfume on Jesus, and I wonder where the line is. And when Jesus said, “Anything you give up for my sake will be returned to you 100 fold,” what about if you give money to a scammer who only gives 10 cents of your dollar to the poor and the other ninety cents goes to his suit?

# Inerrancy Of The Bible

## Hebrews

 I do not believe in the authority of the Writer of Hebrews. We don’t know who he was, and his book is contrary to the scriptures. He writes that under the law there is no forgiveness without the shedding of blood. Leviticus 5:11, if a man is too poor to sacrifice an animal he may give a tenth of an ephah of grain and he will be forgiven. He was wrong. The Writer says it is impossible for God to lie. 1 Kings 22:20-25, God puts a deceiving spirit in the mouths of four hundred false prophets to entice King Ahab to fall at Ramoth-gilead. Isaiah 6:8-10, the famous, “Whom shall I send?” “Here am I, send me” passage, what is God sending Isaiah to do? To deceive his people. “Make their ears dull and their eyes dim, otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and return and be healed,” and we can’t have that. Jeremiah 20:7, Jeremiah prays to God, his opening statement: “O Lord, You have deceived me and I was deceived.” God can do what He wants. It is not impossible. The Writer was wrong. The Writer says for those who have been enlightened and tasted the heavenly gift, who have become partakers of the Holy Spirit and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come, if they fall away it is impossible to restore them to repentance. Luke 17:4, what did Jesus say? If your brother sins against you seven times a day, and returns to you seven times, saying, “I repent,” forgive him. The Word of Christ is not inconsistent with the nature of God. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness (1 John 1:9). He is the exact representation, according to the Writer. Here’s another good point, 2 Peter 3:9, the Lord is not slow about His promise but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish but for all to come to repentance. The reason you are still alive is because God hasn’t given up hope for you. If it is impossible to restore you to repentance, there would be no hope for you. You would just be pollution on the earth as God puts it in Isaiah 24:5. But you’re not dead, which tells me that God hasn’t lost hope for you. He’s patient, and His mercies are new every morning (Lamentations 3:22-23). The writer says it’s impossible to restore the fallen to repentance because they again crucify to themselves Christ, putting Him to public shame. So the first time wasn’t good enough to cover all my sins? Christ’s blood was insufficient? 1 John 1:7, the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin. It seems to me that “all” would include the whole amount of sins and exclude none. The Writer himself says that our great High Priest offered one sacrifice for all time (Hebrews 10:12-14). His notion of impossible repentance is not only inconsistent with theology and Scripture, but with himself.

# Belief In vs. Belief That

## What does “Jesus is Lord,” mean?

Paul said both “Jesus is accursed,” and “Jesus is Lord,” in the same verse. One cannot be spoken with the Holy Spirit, the other cannot be spoken without. This tells me that anyone can utter a set of meaningless words with or without the Spirit. The question depends on which set of words you recognize as being true? Words in and of themselves are meaningless. Which set of words does your life concur with? If “Jesus is Lord,” what affirms those words in your life. Do you recognize them as true, or is it just an insurance card so you can “know” you have the Joy Spirit? If “Jesus is Lord” than you are a partaker of the Holy Spirit. But only you can ascribe meaning, weight, and gravity to those words. If you say those words for insurance, you have some level of belief in them. If when you say those words, knowing you have the Holy Spirit, and you take unlimited joy in that, treasure that, your burdens seem lifted from upon your shoulders, you need no longer test yourself to recognize who is in you.

Paul was not saying that if you say, “Jesus is Lord,” that’s assurance that you have the Holy Spirit. He was saying if you don’t have the Holy Spirit than it isn’t true of you to say that Jesus is your Lord. Maybe.

“The second evidence of the Spirit’s testimony is that he’s crying from the heart, ‘Abba, Father!’ Now think about that. A computer can be programed to say, ‘Abba, Father.’ We all know that. There’s nothing in the words that prove anything and Paul knows that. The point is, when this cry, ‘Daddy! Father!’ arises from a heart with authentic, humble, need of a helpless child, craving and desperately in need of a Father’s wisdom and a Father’s care and a Father’s provision, and a Father’s rescue, are ready-heart, ready to submit like a trusting child. That is the work of the Holy Spirit. No human being feels those affection for Abba Father except the Spirit wrought. Paul said you can’t say Jesus is Lord let alone God is Father without the Holy Spirit.” ~ [John Piper](http://www.desiringgod.org/interviews/can-i-be-sure-i-m-saved-if-persevering-is-the-proof)

The FDA is outlawing chiropractic and homeopathic remedies that work because the companies who make prescribed drugs want more money, the leading cause of death in America by the way. That’s more criminal than the man who steals. That isn’t progress, that’s a framework for crime.

All laws legislate morality. They say a certain behavior is right and the opposite behavior is wrong. When we say a behavior is acceptable it’s a moral decision. So all laws legislate morality, the only question is whose morality? I think we ought not legislate the morality that is yours or mine, but ours. The morality that was given to us by God, the morality that is true and accountable to what is really right.

Some people don’t believe in God. - an element of conflict is good in any discussion. It shows everybody’s taking part and nobody’s left out. If there is no absolute truth serving as the arbiter that two people in an argument can appeal to, there is only one appeal left: and that’s power. If there is no God, the closest thing we have to moralism is a philosophy called desirism, which says.... Hitler and Germans were right to kill Jews, because that was the most common desire in that society. That was the moral thing for them to do. It would be analogous to killing cockroaches for your grandmother. It’s the moral thing. Now you can believe that, but I am not willing to subscribe to that philosophy. I think the holocaust was wrong, and Hitler will have to answer to God one day because of it. So we can believe whatever we want about morality, you have that right, we can disagree and that’s a good thing, only God can judge, not me, but I believe a day will come when God will judge, and that, I think, ought to scare us. Judgment day will come upon us and its God’s job to sit in that throne, not mine, so I can’t condemn anyone, but I think we ought to live like we have someone to be accountable to. We can believe and do anything we want, but it’s my belief that we will be accountable for how we excersize that right. Judgment doesn’t belong to me, but it belongs to someone greater than me. So however you see fit to live, Grace to you, and I wish you well.

A cool, fall-like, cloudy day showed up at the end of summer, with the kind of crisp air that I love to fill my lungs with. There is something about the air in 65° F whether that makes me come alive. I feel new and refreshed, and it reminds me of fond memories. I opened my window and the next morning I woke up with a slight cold. My nose was completely clogged and I couldn’t breath at all. Now the air was just so beautiful that I went downstairs and opened the windows there, and the door. That night, I had a dilemma in whether or not to keep my window open during the night. “My synesis are on the fritz, I feel pretty rotten, but it is such a beautiful night and nights like this don’t often occur in Texas, so I’ll leave it open tonight.” I decided to leave it open so I could enjoy the rare but beautiful day. It wasn’t until I woke up at 4:30 I these morning, still unable to breath and feeling sicker, that I thought to myself, “What are you doing? If the window makes you sick the logical thing to do is close the window.” The air was my object of pressure. It felt amazing to me like nothing else. But it was making me sick and it was making me miserable. Maybe some of you have an open window in your life, something pleasurable thing that makes you feel amazing, but it’s killing your soul and making you miserable. Maybe tonight is the night that you wake up and say “What am I doing? Yes, I love this air. No doubt. It’s good. But it’s making me miserable! It’s making me sick. The eye is the lamp of the body and when it’s unhealthy your body will be full l of darkness. Blessed are the pure in heart, for that shall see God. Maybe you’re eyes are dim, because pornography is good, but it’s making you blind to the glory and majesty and goodness of God and Christ. Maybe, just maybe, tonight, some of you will get out of bed and close your windows. Maybe the chirping of the birds and the newness of the season is so appealing to you, but you realize, “man, I can’t breathe it in anyway. The thing that felt so good to me is making me feel so sick that I can even feel it’s goodness anymore. And it’s taken me this long to realize that it’s not worth it.

Jesus has never sent us to win arguments, He sent us to win souls. When we’re so worried with what we’re going to say, we too often spend too much effort preparing to destroy any logic they have against us. That isn’t our mission. That’s why Jesus said, “Listen, don’t worry about what to say beforehand, the Holy Spirit will teach you what to say.” Because we can be rational and logical and win all the arguments in the world, but in my experience winning arguments isn’t particularly effective in favor of the Kingdom of God. I have all this knowledge, and I have to consciously withhold it in order to build a bridge into this person’s heart language. In fact it would be better if I didn’t have all of these arguments from the years of knowledge I accumulated to distract me from what the Holy Spirit wants me to say in order to win them to Christ. I have to be very careful to suppress the natural impulse I get to defend my honor, lest I make them feel stupid and burn the bridge down so that later Christians will no longer have an opportunity to reach them. Because arguments don’t make converts, it only makes enemies. Arguments don’t serve as invitations to grace, they just make discord. And if you look at 1 Peter 3:15, if you keep reading, the purpose he gives for giving a defense with gentleness isn’t to win people to Christ, but so that those who rebuke you will be but to shame. I’ve never known shame to be a particularly useful weapon in the inventory of the Spirit to bring people to redemption… Scratch that.

And we’ve never seen it, but it’s all we know. ... there will be those who say, “just had a me and Jesus moment,” as if when they glanced up shaking their head and running their eyes at that stupid comment, Jesus was shaking His head in agreement. But I tell you Jesus will say to them, no I didn’t, you just thought I did. I never know you. We’ll say to him, you were with us, and the funny thing is, we’re not delusional, we’re just liars. We’re never seen Him, we’ve never experienced His glory. We’ve been lying to other people and we’ve been lying to ourselves, because the purple who taught us have never experienced Him either. We feel the wind on our skin and say, “it’s the holy spirit!” Children! Christ is not a superstition. Creation is not the Creator. Chemicals are not the Devine. When the Holy Spirit comes on you, you will receive power, not emotions,

devils don’t tremble when pastors open their mouths and talk, they tremble when his people now their knees and pray. Preaching effects men, but praying effects God, and God effects everything.

Let us stand, all ye children of God, for it is written,

don’t kid yourself Keighley, nobody feels pain unless they can look back and remember what it is not to feel that way.

somebody whose thought about would be a little upset that he didn’t choose you. Because from the way you talk about him, it sounds like you would’ve chosen him.

The reason there is a debate at all is because every time someone sins, something in their soul says, “Will I be forgiven for this? A tree is known by the fruit it bears, and I’m not bearing the fruit of the Spirit, so I must not have the Holy Spirit and I must not be saved.” And therefore we set our hope on doing better. We set our hope on one day overcoming this indwelling sin that has been clutching us in its grasp since the day we reached for it. Our hope is in ourselves. Our hope isn’t in grace, our hope is in the power of Christ to change the nature of who we are. We think to ourselves, “Maybe grace _is_ Christ indwelling us so that we no longer sin and do good works,” but what we’re missing is that the grace is to be given us _when Jesus Christ is revealed_. He’s coming again, and He is coming on chariots of fire with justice for those whose hope is in themselves and grace for those whose hope is in Him.

Taking a census leans a man’s intuition into trusting in numbers. (Ken Graves, s013e04m8)

David Prophesied through his music. He calmed the spirit of a tormented soul through that ministry.

in my judgment the rejection of xs energy on the basis of magical contracts isn’t warranted. You have people getting addicted to monster and red bull, and it gives them heart problems and health issues, and I know someone who cannot stop drinking because doctors have said if he stops his system will fail and he will die, because it’s bad for you. Xs, the #2 energy drink in the world, has never been diagnosed as the cause of any health problems. I know people who drink 3 a day, and they go a few days without it And they are perfectly fine. It doesn’t toll their body like other drinks like coffee. It’s not addictive. Go without coffee after 3 a day and you’ll get a headache.

If you had the chance to shoot and kill Hitler before he committed the atrocity that lead to 11 million deaths, would you take it? I would be at least morally justified in my mind, if not morally obligated to take the shot. Yet when I think about it, Hitler was in God’s sights from the day he was born, and if someone with His authority did not choose to take his life, how should someone with my authority do it?

Self-given praise is empty. You cannot give yourself anything. There was a fall fast-break event at my church during my Sophomore year of high school, and every year we go to a little place in the middle of nowhere that has land stretching farther than you can see, and on the last day of the event we do a game of capture the flag in the dark. Now I had a buddy named D’angelo, he was a little black middle-schooler, not very big. Throughout the whole day, there was another guy named Tony who was just irritated with D’angelo. During capture the flag, Tony just started cussing D’angelo out, shouting and threating harm to him, and then he began to march over there, so I ran to intercede for my friend and immediately put Tony in an arm-lock. He was struggling, worming around, but he couldn’t get out, and then I felt bad. I was like, “What did I just do? Did I seriously not try to talk to him first?” So I just said, “Okay, calm down buddy, I’m going to let you out now.” And as soon as I released him he tried to snap my arm with some kind of martial arts, but he wasn’t strong enough, so he ran to the elders and tattled that I had put him in an arm-lock. Now at this point, I came up and just said, “Hey listen man, I’m sorry about that. I thought you were serious about beating up D’angelo. I just didn’t want my teammate to get hurt.” And he looked at me, “Yeah okay.” And I said, “So we’re cool?” with my hand out, and he shook my hand and said, “Yeah, we’re cool.” And when I looked up, Mr. Steve was looking at me like, “Yeah, you handled that.” I felt honored by the look all the adults gave me by settling that. The funny thing is that humility credits you more honor than pride does. I could have gone up and ratted Tony out for cussing and said, “He was threating my teammate! I was right in defending him. I’m justified.” That would be setting myself above Tony. “I’m better than him.” If I had done that, I would not have made a friend of tony, and I would have received no honor from the adults.  When we try to exalt ourselves, we don’t end up exalted. It’s a paradox of life. When we’re prideful for ourselves, there’s no room for anyone else to be proud of us. But when we’re humble, we receive honor.

Leviticus is a very special book close to my heart. Growing up we hear a lot about what God is supposedly like, “He does this, He would never do that,” but I remember the first time going through Leviticus just being blown away at what God is like. He was nothing like I had been taught He was, it was like I was seeing for myself what God is really like firsthand. He was so much more than the Disney-fied version of God I heard about in church. This God wasn’t afraid of people. This God wasn’t begging for us to have a relationship with Him. This God wasn’t depending on humans to have worth. This God was ultimate, mighty, powerful, to be revered. You can learn a lot about God by looking at His laws. “This is just, this is unjust. This I love, this I hate.” It’s like dating. When you go on a date you’re learning about each other, “I like this, I don’t like that.” You’re figuring out what that person is all about. Reading Leviticus is like dating God.

I need to make some clarifications. I do not doubt that I will enter into God’s Kingdom on judgement day. Why? Because my hope is set fully on the grace to be given me when Jesus Christ is revealed. My doubt is that I’m missing eternal life today. My doubt is that I do not have the fullness of what Christ purchased on that tree. I hope people go to hell. I had a dream beating

If people hate you, it is not your fault. For a long time I looked at scripture and said, “The Holy Spirit produces all of these attributes in relationships to other people, and there is no harvest in my life, therefore I do not have the Holy Spirit.” Don’t worry about it. Not even Jesus was righteous is everybody’s eyes. People called him a worker of the Devil, possessed, and all kinds of revilement. Jesus said if the world hates you don’t worry about it, it hated me first. If your brother or sister hates you, it isn’t your fault. Jesus said “I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.” There is a time for revilement, but it is commanded that it be done with gentleness. So if somebody is accusing you of being unloving, unjoyful, unpeaceful, impatient, unkind, not good, unfaithful, ungentle, or uncontrolled, don’t be phased by it. There will be many accusers, but you don’t have to answer them. When you realize it isn’t your fault, and that you don’t have to defend yourself, you can finally put away the sword of argument and extend mercy to the person accusing you. When you don’t have that small voice in your head telling you that they are right, you have no obligation to tell them they are wrong.

Don’t use your phone voice when you’re praying. Do you know people like that? That when they’re on the phone they sound completely different, like a commercial version of them or something? Maybe they talk faster and higher pitch, and they pretend to be nicer than they are, and they often incorporate a bunch of fake laughing. Don’t do that when you’re praying. I stumble when I hear people pray with a fast pace, commercialized phone voice. If that’s your relationship with God, you’re seriously missing out. He’s not on the other line, He’s right there in the hearts of those who have received Him.

When the apostles began speaking in tongues after the Holy Spirit came on them in a wind, that was a gift of the Holy Spirit. If, however, they had set aside years of study to learn those languages, it would merely be a skill they have, because it would be their study that enables them to speak in tongues, not the Holy Spirit. This is not to be unmindful that every breath and heartbeat is from God, but a skill is not the same as a gift.

A virtue isn’t automatically a fruit. A fruit is something that grows out of your relationship with Christ. A virtue is something you labor for; it’s self imposed and doesn’t come naturally. You can put on a smile like makeup, but it doesn’t mean your joyful. You can craft words like a forgery piece of art, but it doesn’t mean you’re kind.

If you can fornicate or commit adultery or look at porn as a Christian, than do it. 1 Cor. 6:9. None of these will inherit the kingdom of God. These sins demonstrate a person is not saved. What if I’m confronted with temptation, and I’m on the fence, I could really go either way, but this time choose to resist. Would that make me saved? It would not. If you could have chosen differently, it wasn’t a fruit of Christ in you, it was was a work conscious of sin. Sinning is like pain, it tells you something is wrong, but it itself isn’t what’s wrong. So don’t numb the pain out and ignore the real problem. If you in your renewed mind can sin, do it, lest you are not a Christian and be deceived. Not the case. If these sins demonstrate a person is not saved, than a person who is saved _could_ not perform them. So the question really comes down to, “_Can_ you sin?” If you can, then by this ruler, you are not saved. If you can sin, you ought to sin so that you can know you’re not saved. This is such a messed up way of judging if a person knows Christ. Judging whether a person is saved comes down to judging whether he or she knows Christ. You can look at his prayer life, you can look at his fruit, you can look to see if he takes joy in listening to the Holy Spirit through the pages of the scriptures, but in the end no man can look that deep into another man’s soul to know what he is really like. God knows, we don’t. All we can really do is pray for him, and demonstrate to him what he might not be experiencing in his life. Why are we so afraid in this culture to use our words? Why not speak to that person?

Addiction isn’t a matter of will power. It isn’t a question of weighing out what you want more. It has you. After Eminem had a near-death experience with methadone, he knew this thing was going to kill him, but he still relapsed about a month later. Addiction isn’t an intellectual battle of, “Life is more important to me than this drug, so I’m not going to take this drug.” The man was going to die, and he couldn’t beat his brain. “The man takes a drink, then the drink takes a drink, then the drink takes the man.” This is a real problem. “For many are the victims she has cast down, And numerous are all her slain” (Proverbs 7:26). Pornography is not a question of will power. It’s not a question of what you want more. “None who go to her return again, Nor do they reach the paths of life” (Proverbs 2:19). When it has you, friends, it will not loosen its grip on you. Why do I even bring this up? Because I think people need to know they’re not alone. Addiction is something you hide, it’s what people do. And I think pornography is something that we all have an awareness that a lot of people do, but there is still something lodged deep in the very nature of hiding something that makes it isolating. Hiding the things in your life isolates you. When you are seen as something you’re not, you’re alone. The very essence of who you are is hidden from the people who define you, and so there is this false definition we all carry around with us that we have to live up to.

“I was extremely distant. I didn’t really talk to nobody, I kind of just went off and just did my own thing. You know, I would just go home and shut the door, or I’d just go off into a bathroom somewhere and pop a couple of pills. But you know I was a functioning addict (an addict of the worst kind), so nobody really knew what was going on. I think people around me just saw that something ain’t right. I hid it really well.” ~ [Marshall Mathers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfsluj4uVyI&app=desktop)

“I had a pretty bad experience. I actually overdosed on methadone, just I didn’t even know what I was taking at the time, I didn’t know it was methadone. I had a near death experience where I literally almost died and came out of the hospital and about a month later relapsed again, and that’s how I knew that this is a disease. You know what I mean? Like this is nothing to do with will power; will power is like, ‘I don’t want that piece of cake over there, so I’m not going to eat it.’ This is a different thing.” ~ [Marshall Mathers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfsluj4uVyI&app=desktop)

If you really want to be the sort of person that makes people want to pursue God, you have to let the Spirit do His job. You don’t do the conviction. You walk away beaten. They walk away rejecting you, but never let them walk away rejected. The Spirit had to do the convicted, or else their just being religious for you. More likely than not you persistence will give birth to quarreling and warranted rejection.

I believe that Christ is better. I believe that the things of heaven are better than the things of earth. It’s what I believe. Anyone who says sex is the best thing on earth doesn’t know what it’s like to feed a hungry child who hasn’t eaten in three days. They don’t know what it’s like to comfort a dying woman as she approaches eternity. They don’t know what it is to watch the sun rise and know that God loves us so much despite all our flaws that He sent His Son to die for us. That He makes the sun rise on the evil and the good, on the just and the unjust.

What do you want? Think about it. Do you want to be liked? A lifestyle of photography? To inherit the earth? All the girls you desire? Now ask yourself a different question: What’s worth it? Pause here and think about that. What is worth your want? What is worth your pursuit? What is actually worthy of being wanted? Because I can think of a lot of things I want, but maybe everything I want is rubbish. Imagine a little child being offered a choice of getting either a marshmallow or 1,000 ounces of gold (worth approximately $1,400,000), and you watch the child choose the marshmallow. There is nothing you can do to persuade that child that the gold is worth more because in his heart the marshmallow is all he wants. It’s worth it to him, but you have to sit there plagued by empathy, troubled, rattled, vexed, all around helplessly disturbed that the kid is making the wrong choice. You just stand there reaching out, “No, no, no! Choose the gold! You can buy all the marshmallows you want with it.” But the child wants the marshmallow. Is there any reason for the child to be dissatisfied? He got everything he wanted. His main goal in that moment was to get the marshmallow, and he got it. So why should the bystander be unsettled? It’s because the wiser person understands that the child has just missed out on something so much greater. He made his treasure something comparatively worthless. It ought to bother the older man. The biggest question you can ask yourself in life is, “What do I treasure?” Once you’ve answered that, everything else is simple. You do whatever it takes to get your treasure. Your whole life depends on that question. What you do, how you spend your time, how you live, the things you say, the personality you shape yourself into, your endeavors; the way you eat, the way you walk, the way you talk, the way you think, the way you sleep, the way you wake up, the way you dress, the way you smile, it all surrounds what you’re aiming for in life. Some people are photography hedonists. Hedonism is a life devoted to pleasure. A photographic hedonist, than, is a person who devotes his life to the pleasure of photography.

There was a song that came out called Airplanes, a movie that came out called the Ultimate Life. He made his whole life devoted to becoming a billion air, and when he finally did it, it “didn’t feel a tick different.” This one thing, this goal for his whole life, and it didn’t fill him like he thought it would. In the prequel, his grandson learned that the ultimate gift it’s something you can touch with your hands.

“[L]ay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us,” The Greeks were very athletic people. They took their games seriously. And when they ran in a race, they would run unencumbered. Now what does unencumbered mean? It means they ran naked. Literally the word means without burden. So wearing clothes was a burden to the Greeks. And what you have to understand is what they wore back then was a long piece of cloth they called chlamys, and it was draped over the tunic in a variety of ways. So as you’re running down the track it would be easily entangled on rocks, other people, tripping over your feet, or anything that was sticking out, and the Writer of Hebrews is saying that’s what your sin is like when you’re running the race of faith. You’ve got to strip naked and run as fast as you can, because you’re trying to finish the race but that sin of yours, that encumbrance keeps entangling you and causes you to trip up in your faith, because the more you sin the less you see God and know Him and the more separated you are from Him, so what you’ve got to do is crank up Ke$ha’s song and take it off. Lay aside your encumbrance, lay aside your sin. The race of faith is has already started, and it’s time to get serious.

Mom said, “I woke up and thought, ‘Oh no, I better get everybody up,’ and was surprised to look out the window and find that everybody was already awake[[EM2]](#_msocom_2) .” Caleb looked over his shoulder to the ceiling where Brian’s room is, and remarked, “Brian’s not awake[[EM3]](#_msocom_3) ,” to which Ethan replied, “Neither were you then[[EM4]](#_msocom_4) .” Caleb contended and said, “Well let me ask you this: When did mom wake up[[EM5]](#_msocom_5) ?” To which Ethan answered, “I don’t know. None of us had the time when she came out.” “You’re still callow.” “So are you!”

One day as I was washing the dishes, watching a sermon as I normally do, the pastor was speaking about being an affirming person. And I thought, “Hmm, that’s interesting. Just last Sunday the pastor at the church I visited was talking about celebrating when people do something good rather than criticizing when they do something wrong.” And then I remembered the first song in a new playlist I made for the new semester, “Speak Life” by tobyMac, which is parallel to the theme of the sermons, about using your words to build up and encourage rather than using criticism as your vessel of encouragement. And then I remembered the new memory verse I has just put up on my desktop, as I was going through the commands of Ephesians, and it happened to be Ephesians 4:29: “Let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth, but only such a word as is good for edification according to the need of the moment so that it will give grace to those who hear.” And then I thought, “Hmm, I wonder if God is trying to tell me something?”

One Wednesday evening as the family was driving to church, I started to pray silently in the back seat about a conviction I had, a downcast feeling of no certain condemnation which produced from a half hour I spent making a fake license to verify a Facebook account. I prayed, “I don’t know what’s right or wrong in this. Just let me know if I should not do this.” And the Holy Spirit was speaking and said during Blanchard’s teaching, “Yet at the same time many even among the leaders believed in him. But because of the Pharisees they would not openly acknowledge their faith for fear they would be put out of the synagogue; for they loved human praise more than praise from God.” And it became clear to me. Anything I do, whether a post on Facebook or anything else, should not be to receive “likes” and the praise of men, but the praise of God. When I came home and started a sermon as I was washing the dishes, on speaker said that we are twisted if we’re not trying to gain the praise of God. Seems backward, right? But on that final day I want God to say, “Well done, my good and faithful servant.” And we should want that.

The first 30 years of your life, your body undergoes something called anabolism, where your body just stores up and build up, and after about 30, it starts the process called catabolism, where it starts breaking down. The average marriage age in America is 26 for woman and 28 for men, so about the time you get married, you are in the best shape of your life. It’s all downhill from there. So if the basis of your marriage is beauty, when that goes away, your marriage won’t have anything to keep it grounded. But if the foundation of your marriage is fearing the Lord, that will only get better as time goes on. If you fear the Lord when you’re young, you’ll fear Him more when you’re old. If you’re compassionate when you’re young, you’ll be more compassionate when you’re old. So if a marriage is grounded in these things, man it just gets better. When snow comes, when winter comes, when it’s the last season of your life and beauty goes away, my household doesn’t fear because we’re dressed in scarlet, we’re dressed in wine, the things that get better as time goes on. Charm is deceitful and beauty is vain, but a woman who fears the Lord will be praised.

I never like to make life decisions without having good reason to base it off of. What you need to understand is that there are no scientific authorities. There is no one whose views are not subject to question, and therefore I need to understand the model of chemistry that applies to blood types reacting to dietary consumption. The plasma membrane of the erythrocytes (yur-ee-thro-sites), or red blood cells, contains special proteins called antigens. Antigens are recognized as foreign partials to the body, which causes the body to create antibodies to provide immunity to the specific antigen. The antibodies that get produced by your body are based on the antigens not present on your red blood cells. Type A red blood cell antigens will produce anti-B antibodies. Anti-A antibodies would destroy type A antigens. Dominant and Recessive. how blood types are inherited. The lectins found in them trigger agglutination (clumping) of the red blood cells when consumed by someone with the wrong blood type.  Lectin’s, just like antibodies, would recognize the transfused red blood cells as foreign and bind to them. If this occurs, it leads to a process called agglutination, where the red blood cells clump together and interfere with blood circulation due to the fact that this clump of cells can clog up small blood vessels in the body.

If Mom is type B and Deborah is type o, then we know mom is heterozygous, meaning her genotype is Bo. Since blood type o is recursive, not dominant, Deborah’s genotype must be oo (since A or B is dominant it would determine her phenotype is she had A or B), which means she inherited one recursive blood type letter o from mom and one from dad. So Dad’s genotype could be either Ao, Bo, or oo, this his phenotype could be any of the three ABO blood types.

In all of my joy, let me enjoy with Your joy. I’m seeking Your praise. Let me enjoy food the way You enjoy food. Do not let my joy, godliness, or union with Christ depend on the walk of my brothers. I will be faithful, to all that I know, but victory is in You hands, and success belongs to You alone.

If you’re any sort of reasonable person, you’re asking the question, “Why should I believe you?” Because if this is true, people need to know. This is life and death. This is freedom and debt. We cannot allow our country to be ruled by the almighty dollar. This is beyond criminal. This is genocide. This is the holocaust. Cancer is a multi-billion dollar industry, and we’re letting people die because rich people are never rich enough. They need more worthless numbers in their bank account so they will take it from dying people who can’t afford to buy their medicine that doesn’t work anyway. We are a democracy, not a money-cracy. Greed is a greater tyranny than any other form of government. It is the reason any government is susceptible to corruption. If we are a democracy, we the people cannot stand by and do nothing about the injustice of our leaders. We have the constitutional right, even obligation to oppose it.

I thought to myself “the lyrics are the same, the music is different. They’re not raising their hands because Christ alone is our cornerstone, they’re raising their hands because the performance was good.” They had people jumping around a little bit.

At the state fair of Texas as we were laying around waiting for the light show to begin and Caleb was telling Brian that I went up to a big buff black gangster looking guy and was like “dude!!!! How much do you bench?!?!!?” If there is one thing I can’t stand is when people imitate other people falsely. If someone is recounting a story somebody’s voice usually ends up being distorted to add to their “badness.” I merely walked up to the guy and said, “how much do you bench bro?” I was not excited or dopey like I was made to sound like. Caleb, I think, mistook my smile as excitement, but I always smile at the fair, especially when meeting someone. I think about how we’re imitators of Christ, and how important it is to know him s and his word so that we won’t imitate him falsely.”

We live in a society that tries to avoid awkward situations as best as we can, do when we don’t understand something we laugh at it. And so we’ve learned to laugh at random things, so what has no humor or comedy has become funny though it is not.

The cloud of witnesses are not witnesses of us, but witnesses of God for us. Since we have the testimonies are this great cloud of examples, let us do what they did. It doesn’t make a lot of sense to set up the reason for enduring the race of faith as because we are being watched by men who have passed from this life to the next.

You keep taking pieces of the last girl to the next girl, and it goes on and on and on until you’re not sticky at all, and sex becomes just a recreation. There’s nothing intimate and beautiful and special about it, it’s just a backrub to a stressed out person.

When trying to explain failures in biological processes, it’s good to first explain how it’s supposed to work, and then proceed to the problem.

The problem is not that “You’re looking at trash on the internet.” No, you’re looking at _people_ with eternal souls on the internet.

If I could give up all of my theology to lose this “holy discontentment” I would do it. Holy discontentment is an onerous burden. It’s like Isaiah the phrophet, he lived in a time that to be content, I think, would have been a sin. It’s like Laodicea, they will be spit out because they are content in the wrong things.

I’ve got nothing better to believe than that the Holy Spirit is in me and on that final day Christ will open His book and read my name, welcoming me as a sheep He is intimately familiar with to His house. There’s nothing better than the treasure of knowing God. But I’m only concerned with the truth. I don’t want to believe something because it’s the best thing to believe, I want to believe it because it’s true.

If the Bible said that miracles were only a normative characteristic of the early church to confirm the new word which was being preached, and ceased to occur because of the cloud of witnesses we now have to confirm that the gospel is from God, I would be ecstaticly happy with that. If the Bible said miracles served as signs that this gospel is from God, I would be satisfied to not perform miracles in life. It isn’t a lust for power or a need for healing that I wonder if we should seek muscles. Power is God’s, and suffering for the name of Christ is a privilege. But the Bible says “whoever believes in me, my works well be in him.” The Bible really lifts up people of faith who trust in God. King Asa trusted in physicians instead of God during a time that was not unique, no words to be confirmed, and the prophet really speaks lowly of this lack of faith in God. (And when we want to hear from God, we go to other people to study our questions. We Google it instead of praying for the Joy Spirit speaking to us in His word to open it moves to understand it.) The Bible says God is glorified to give us what we ask for in Christ’s name. The Bible says to have church elders lay hands on the sick to heal them.

Growing up I heard the same message: believe, believe, believe. But in the Bible there’s another language: examine, test, reason with me says God.

What did Jesus mean when he said, “When people come doing miracles claiming to be the Christ, do _not_ believe them,” except that faith is not blind? On the contrary, the gospel isn’t about just believing without good reason, even without very good reasons like miracles (“Don’t believe them even though they give you good reasons”); the gospel is about seeing. Do you _see_ it?

Flexibility does not mean drifting through life like a piece of wood floating downstream wherever the flow takes us. We are casual agents and we need to be intentional about the way we use our time. A plan can be flexible, but the absence of a plan cannot be flexible, because there is no substance to bend.

Your goal is to have your hand wrapped around the top part of his hand with him holding the bottom part of yours. As soon as you hear the word go, pull your hand towards you in order to force your opponent’s hand away from his body, and force your opponent’s hand back, and expose his wrist by twisting your wrist towards you. This will mess up his leverage and increase yours. Hopefully, you’ll notice your opponent’s grip beginning to slip. As soon as you notice this, start moving your grip higher up on his hand. Once your opponents hand is hovering over the table, rotate your body so that your shoulder is in line with the direction you want your arm to go. Wrist curls work your forearm.

When I’m out ministering to unbelievers I used to approach them and say, “Can I ask you a question?” They’d say, “Sure.” So I’d ask them this: “Okay, let’s say a genie came to you, and instead of giving you three wishes, she gave you two options, one of two choices to make. You can have everything your heart desires for the next year, anything you want; all the money you want, all the women you want, the most luxurious resort, good health, just anything your heart desires for the next year. And at the end of that year, everything will be taken from you and you will have nothing except the clothes on your back for the rest of your life. That’s option one. Or, option two, you can have just enough to get by for the next year, just barely enough food, just enough water and whatever else to survive, you’re just scraping by, but at the end of that year you will have anything you want for the rest of your life. Again, the most luxurious resort, good health, longevity of life, money, women, anything you want for the rest of your life. Which one would you choose?” Without fail every person has answered, “Option two.” And then I say, “Why option two? I mean, you could have everything you want right now. You don’t need to wait. You could have it all today.” And they say, “Well in the long-run it’s going to be more worth it.” Aha, two key concepts you don’t often get young people to say: long-run and worth it. I do this just to show them that they consider those two very important things when it’s obvious to them. We all consider the after, and we all consider what’s worth it. Then I say, “Let me ask you just one more question. What do you believe about heaven?” This is where they get that declining, “Oh, you have a religious agenda…” look.

Here’s how it goes: Because of our sin we can’t hang out with God. But by grace through faith in Jesus Christ, if we call out for a Savior Jesus, we can hang out with God. The problem is we didn’t know we were sinners, so we didn’t know we needed a savior. So God gave us the law to show us our sin so that we would call on a Savior. The problem is we thought He gave us the law to keep it so we could hang out with God; and none of us could do it. The good news is once some of us finally admit we can’t do it, we understand the plan and call out for a savior. Yay.

This past year in 2015, I woke up one morning and started thanking God that I was alive. It was a beautiful, rainy day, I had good teeth, a comfortable bed in a cozy room to shelter me from the cold wet night, it was just a sort of perfect morning as I laid there in bed thanking God for all of His goodness and blessings. I looked over at my wake-up light conveniently telling me exactly what time it was, 8:00AM, and then I looked to my left toward the window again and my neck popped. While I was still deciding whether it felt good or bad, I looked back over to the right and a severe stabbing / cramping feeling came over the trapezius muscle in my neck. Ouch! At first I tried popping it back in place, but I couldn’t do it and the pain was too sever to keep trying. It didn’t seem to be out of place anyway, but the only directing I could look was down-left. Then a precious thought came over me and caused me to smile, as I thanked God for counting me worthy to suffer. Praying for an elder at my church, Blanchard Jacobus, who had a very sever muscle cramp the night before, I wondered if we had the same thing. Blanchard it probably the toughest person I know, dealing with all sorts of pain but you would never know it. A couple of hours later my mom wished me a good morning and noticed my head pointed awkwardly down to my left. Asking me if something was wrong with my neck, she called our family chiropractor and drove me down to the office. On way such wonderful songs were playing on the radio, “You’re a good, good, Father, that’s who You are.” I imagine it sounded a bit like when Nehemiah rebuilt the Temple, when so many were rejoicing for it and yet those who had seen Solomon’s temple were grieving so loudly that nobody could tell whether Israel was grieving or rejoicing. Singing along with the songs with shouts of pain here and there was a little bit amusing to me. As we drove on I remembered King Asa who trusted in the physicians instead of God, saying, “You know mom, I’m willing to imagine that no physician can heal anybody without God doing the work. King Asa trusted in physicians, and the physician couldn’t heal him.” This was my way of understanding that even though we were going to the doctor, it was God who would heal me or not. When we arrived there, after waiting for a bit, we went into a room to be looked at. Dr. Ashby immediately knew what was wrong. Explaining to me what had happened, he used a little device to relax the tensed and very swollen muscle. It seems like the best feeling in the world, but made me excessively thirsty. After a minute I began feeling very nauseous. He ran out and quickly got me some water at my request. Giving me directions to the bathroom, I stood up and stumbled my way through the hallway. I was dizzy and everything appeared to me mainly black, but as I found the bathroom as I switched on the light, I couldn’t see any objects but rather an array of black with spots of glorious yellow light. Feeling my way to the toilet, I was relieved to let out my nausea. Even so, the nausea was worth it to relieve the neck. As my vision cleared I saw in the mirror that I was drenched with sweat. My chest was covered in it and my shirt was soaking as well. Coming out of the bathroom, the doctor remarked, “You’re looking a lot better,” which was exactly how I was feeling. I still couldn’t move my head anywhere I wanted, but it felt so good to look forward after having it stuck down to the left for 3 hours. On the way home I talked about how fearful I had been a few nights ago after having a conversation with a relative about a demon named Lam who had been conjured some time ago and sketched, looking very similar to alien grays. I related how terrified I was that night, yet I really appreciated it because that terror magnified my perception of God’s greatness. Not that I had totally subscribed to the notion that Alien sightings were connected with disembodied Nephilim, but the possibility even introducing itself at night had me scared out of my skin, which made me realize how much God protects me from every day. And as I thought how the things I was scared of tremble and shudder before God, the bigger my fear of them was, the bigger my understanding of God’s power seemed to be. There are so many things we can say to each other that offer thanks to God. Don’t waste your words and thoughts. Suffering really is such a blessing, because in the midst of it we can praise God with 10,000 reasons.

Don’t you want to be a generation that’s right standing? Where parents can trust their children with each other because we live our lives above reproach? Aren’t you tired of carrying around the shame and guilt and isolation that inevitably makes its home in the restless minds of those who deep down know they’re not doing what they were made to do? It’s a burden I wasn’t able to bear, and I pray you the wisdom to lay it down.

I am going to submit that the wedding feast in Luke isn’t “then and there,” but in the “here and now.” The response of the invited ones were that they were too busy. “I just bought this field, I’m going to go check it out,” or “I just bought some oxen, I’m going to try them out.” After we die, there won’t be anything else to keep us from going to the wedding feast. It’s only here on earth that things distract us from what is ultimately precious. Nobody is going to say after they die, “I just bought some oxen, maybe another time.” It’s on earth that we get too busy for the invitation. “I know I could come boldly into the throne room of the almighty God who created all the hosts under the canopy of the heavens, but there’s this really great TV show on and my brain is fried from a long day.” Jesus is inviting us to know Him, and if we pass up that opportunity here and now, we’re going to miss the wedding feast.

George brynar surveyed ten thousand self-identified Christians with six fundamental truths, which belonged to nine percent 28m Ken graves.

You don’t love someone because they add value to your life. You love them because you just do. Love involves sacrifice and compromise. Love will take time, not give it. Love will cost you your money, your dreams, your projects, your work, your very self, and yet somehow without love life is empty. Love is reverse. It’s what wakes somebody up on the morning. Don’t be too busy to live with love.

Kindness is a mystery. But more than that, people are a mystery. When somebody gets sick, people become kind to him. “Can I get you anything?” “Oh here, let me do that for you.” “Don’t worry about the dishes tonight; I’ll do them.” We treat the sick very differently than we would were they healthy. Or if somebody is leaving for a year and are really busy packing, we do what we can to help carry her burden. Y’all, this is the way we’re supposed to act all the time. Kindness isn’t a variable part of living. We’re supposed to make the showing of honor an Olympic event. Do something to honor somebody today. Treat somebody as if they were sick today. “Let me do this for you.” “Go rest, I’ll do what needs to be done.”

Mine is a headphones generation. We’re all trying to quiet the world with noise. Ironic, isn’t it? We do everything we can to silence the thoughts running through our brain. Why don’t most people like classical music anymore? Because it leaves room for thoughts. It doesn’t clutter our mind with words. We can still pray with instruments because it speaks to our hearts, not our minds. It’s because there’s not someone speaking to us.

Do you believe God will judge rightly? Then punishment is an act of faithlessness. Or why do you set yourself on God’s throne and judge before the appointed time? Vengeance belongs to the Lord. #1corinthians4:5-6

We don’t know where the other people in Genesis 4 came from, whether from Adam or from God; the text doesn’t tell us. And if God didn’t find it necessary for us to have that knowledge, I see no reason to think contrary.

Happiness and sadness are not polar to each other. They aren’t like light and dark, darkness being the absence of light. No, sadness is its own thing. There’s a word for the absence of happiness, and it’s called _empty_. But that’s very different from sad. I know what it is to be empty, and when I was empty I used to lay in bed at night just praying for something to make be sorrowful, because I wanted to feel _something_, anything. For me, sadness was the means to happiness. It made me happy to be sad. The two can be dance partners. Have you every realized how good it feels to cry? Or when we’re at a funeral for someone we believe has ascended to an infinitely better place, we can be simultaneously happy to see them go and sad to see them go. It’s better for them, and frankly it’s better for us because we’re not going bankrupt caring for them, but something inside of us aches that we’re without them.

When you’re young you spend all of your time outside, so neighbors are just a part of life. When you get older, though, it’s like, “Okay, I’m going to get up at 6:30 and pray for half an hour, then read my Bible for an hour, check the market forecast, then get breakfast and empty the dishwasher, check the S&P500, monitor active positions and make necessary adjustments, go running, grab a shower, study pro-re-nata, go to school,” and usually the twenty seconds it takes to get to your car isn’t the same twenty seconds as your neighbor, but on the occasion that it is, it’s like, “Hi neighbor, . . .” And then you go about your day.

Exodus 32:14: The context is Moses went up on a mountain, the Israelites didn’t know what happened to him and made a golden calf, God tells Moses to stand back because He’s about to destroy His people and make a nation out of Moses, Moses entreats the Lord and asks Him to change His mind, and verse 14, “The Lord changed His mind.” God can be reasoned with, people. God can change His mind if He wants to. It’s blasphemy to try and fit God into our little box of doctrine and say, “He can do this, He can’t do this.” There is a doctrine of immutability that has swept over the nation of America, and this verse says, “Excuse me, no, that’s not correct.” This isn’t up for interpretation. It’s a clear statement. You can twist this passage all you want, fold it up nice and neat to fit in your pocket of theology, but the more you do that the less you know God, and if you don’t know God He’ll say to you on that final day, “I don’t know you,” and you’ll be turned away. Knowing God is serious stuff. It isn’t something to be tampered with. The Jews, Paul said, have a zeal for God, and that’s something to be respected; the problem is that it is zeal that is not according to knowledge about God. If you want to know God you can’t filter Him through your imagination. There is a truthfulness to God. He is the truth, not just whatever we imagine about Him.

It isn’t love that makes for a full life, but wisdom; for Anakin was lost, confused and angry, but his master lacked nothing. A more worthy partner in life than a wife is wisdom. A more fulfilling love is good sense. She will look after you and keep watch over your emotions.  If you want a fulfilling life, seek wisdom.

That anxious longing we all have for something more is meant to be satisfied, not severed. There’s a word for people who’ve disconnected themselves from that wanting and it’s called _empty_.

I think eternal security is one of the most ironic doubts I’ve ever had. What you find in scripture is an “if” language. You are being saved, now reconciled, blameless, above reproach, “if indeed you continue in the faith,” “if you hold fast to the word I preached to you.” And that “if” is what caused me to ponder that there is no such thing as “once saved always saved.” “Every brand _in Me_ that does not bear fruit He takes away,” Jesus said. The ironic part of this mentality is that I looked at my sin and said, “I have fallen away. My sin has caused me to be cut off from the vine.” That statement is the falling away that Paul is addressing in these passages. He says over and over it is by grace alone through faith alone that you are saved, _if_ you continue _in the faith_. Not if you stop sinning, but if you keep your hope set fully on the grace to be given you when Jesus Christ is revealed. Your sin is no obstacle to salvation, your disbelief is. Salvation is _for_ sin, and therefore sin doesn’t invalidate it. If sin cancelled out salvation from sin the good news would be terrible news, because grace wouldn’t be grace and who would then be saved? The _if_ is if you continue in the gospel of Christ that you are saved by grace through faith apart from the works of the law, i.e. apart from not sinning.

The answer is in the purest love, the love with which you love a child. The golden light hitting the four walls in the vanilla room, after awakening from a night of perfect dreams, wandering the college with a brother, scrambling to retake a test that I tore in half, running back down the alley away from a dog bigger than me.

“This enslaving addiction is not a light matter to me. I’m too unstable to guard against it. All it takes is a moment of forgetting my drive and motivation. I can feel my sanity being ripped from me. The brain damage is slowly taking control of my actions. It feels as though it isn’t a conscious choice. I’m losing myself to it. It’s chipping away at my soul and my mind. Chip. Chip. I need an anthem. I’m not clearheaded. Lucidity is a stranger to me now. Where is salvation? Who am I? I am but a stillborn child of the kingdom. Mourn for me all you of God. Pray for the salvation of those who will come after me. Pray, fast, do everything you can. And as the darkness takes me, I know I am nothing. The hands who fashioned me are the hands who fashioned Lucifer. Both made magnificent, and both surrendered to rebellion. My sin has orbited seven stars, but I was brought forth in iniquity. The law came at the twelfth rotation, and so sin is judged to be sin. No sacrifice was available for me, for one had already been given. Never having known, never having seen, yet something was in my eyes. To be deceived is the way of many who will be turned away, who say, “I know the Lord.” Is it from the Devil, or from the Church? Or is it I who am only now deceived? More rooms in hell, more space in heaven, who shall ascend with the Lord? Those who are His sheep will go to a table prepared for them. And those who sin are not His sheep, so says one sent from God. And as we burn in eternal fire, we were powerless to be saved. For those whom God predestined, He justified, and those He justified are glorified. None who are His will be snatched from the Son. Pray, all you who are His, that the many will be cut short. Oh that the few would be multiplied! Pray, you men of God, pray! What have I on earth to take me from God? What have I gained that I was surrendered? A momentary pleasure I did not desire, yet I was sold as a slave to it. Will I be saved if I throw myself to the cold? My works will never suffice. And yet without them I have not faith, except that which is dead from the womb. Works which do not spring from faith are dead, and faith which does not spring forth works is like it. Woe to the sinners whose sin did not cease! Woe to the patient not healed from disease!

# Temporary Reference

# Carnal Christian Or Sinless Son?

## You Will Not Gratify The Desires Of The Flesh

Notice what Paul doesn’t say. He doesn’t say, “Walk by the Spirit and you will not _have_ the desires of the flesh.” He says, “Walk by the Spirit and you will not _gratify_ the desires of the flesh.”

## Carnal Christian Or Sinless Son?

Don’t get it twisted, Ethan. No one who knows God or has seen Him continues to sin. You physically cannot sin. Literally. Don’t deceive yourself by saying that means you are without sin, because we both know there’s sin living in you. What it means is that it is no longer you who do it, but sin living in you, and therefore you are dead to sin and can no longer sin. Hamartano has no properties of habitual sin, it just means to miss the mark like any other word for it. It’s the same word used when Jesus said, “If your brother sins against you seven times and comes and repents seven times, forgive him.” Do you really think John was saying Jesus treats us differently than he commanded us to treat each other? Or that His commands are inconsistent with His nature? That’s blasphemy. Paul said what _shall_ we say then, not what _can_ we say then. Understand it clearly, friend, all things are permissible for you, but not all things are beneficial for you. Don’t make the Bible a stumbling block to Your faith by twisting it. _Shall_ we sin? Absolutely not. That is, shall we sin willingly? That’s not a paradoxical question. You can absolutely sin against your will. That is, the sin living in you will cause sin in your life through the neurons in your brain without regard to the Spirit of your mind, which is your conscious self. Ever felt like you were acting against your will? You were. You don’t practice sin. You can’t. The question is, since it is sin living in me, not I myself who does it, do I ask for forgiveness? Or is it blasphemy to ask for forgiveness because by grace through faith I’ve been saved and can no longer sin?

## The Law Is A Tutor To Bring Us To Christ

I hate my sin and resent it for all the grief and joylessness it has rendered me, and for how it has grieved God’s own Spirit, but if I had the chance to do it over again, I would not prevent it. The reason is that if I never sinned I would not have been humbled by the law to the extent where I needed a savior. I would have been one of the people on the final day who comes before the throne and says, “Let me in, look at all I have done in Your name.” And Jesus would have responded and said, “Depart from me, I never knew you.” Now it is not my sin to credit for bringing me to Christ. Rather, it is the law that brought me to Christ. For without the law I would have no knowledge of sin. Sin did not make me aware of sin; the law made me aware of sin. Sin did not humble me; the law humbled me, for I sinned before I was humbled. Therefore I delight in the law because it brought me to Christ, and I grieve for my sin because it kept me from Christ. I was born into sin apart from God, but I rejoice, because sin did not succeed in keeping me from Christ but through the law I found Him.

##  If Christ Has Not Resurrected, You’re Still In Your Sins

If Christ didn’t resurrect than we’re still in our sins. Why? Because our sins are still counted against us. If Christ resurrected than we can no longer sin because it’s sin doing it. He is talking to someone with the premise that they are not in their sins. I’m arguing that he does not mean they do not sin, because Christ’s resurrection would be irrelevant if they really don’t sin. If they don’t sin they are not in their sin.

## “Depart From Me”

There is a sin that thrives when people think they have enough favor from God stored up in their constitution that they can afford it.

## All Things Permissible, Seek Beneficial

All things are permissible for me--I cannot sin. If anyone sins he has not known the Father or seen Him. To sin is to miss the mark of God’s perfect goodness, but I am covered by God’s righteousness imputed to me by faith through grace alone. If Jesus did not sin, I cannot sin. To sin is to corrupt one’s own holiness such that he cannot stand in God’s holiness. I have been sealed with the promises holy spirit--I cannot sin. I can do that which is contrary to the law and I can act contrary to God’s good nature, but I cannot be apart from God, indeed I cannot sin. All things are permissible to me, but not all things are beneficial to me. For if I act contrary to God’s nature I produce grief and do not abide in Him.

## By Faith, Work

 Faith or works? The answer is works by faith. Works by faith. It’s hard to understand at first because people start thinking along the lines of, “Well I have faith but it isn’t producing works, so how can works come from faith?” Here’s how. Jesus has promised a resurrection. This is how that will make sense: I want you to think of “works by faith” in terms of Noah. God told Noah that a flood was coming, and by faith, Noah was saved, because by faith Noah built in ark. God saved Noah by warning him of the flood, but salvation only came by obeying God. It wouldn’t have been enough for Noah to have merely said, “I believe a flood is coming, oh God!” if he neglected to do what God said and build the ark. You see, it’s only by faith that Noah built the ark. If Noah didn’t believe a flood was coming, he would not have built the ark for the salvation of him and his family. But by faith he believed God and built an ark. Works by faith.

## The Kingdom Of God Is Not Heaven

 There’s a clear distinction in the scriptures between Heaven and the Kingdom of God. Jesus said no one has ascended into Heaven except for the one who has descended from Heaven at the same time he was saying the Kingdom of God is near, at hand, and among you.

## Lordship Salvation Is A Question Of Psychology, Not Theology

It seems to me that the Lordship controversy isn’t talking about what it takes to get saved—both agree that it is faith alone—but rather how you can know that you are saved. When the Lordship Salvationist says you are not saved if you do not work, they do not mean that you are not saved because you do not work, but rather that you do not work because you are not saved (if you had believed truly, you would have worked). It isn’t a question of theology, it’s a question of psychology. It’s trying to examine a person to see whether or not they have saving faith. Both agree on what saving faith is, the disagreement is . . . . Imagine two workers who will be paid for planting an apple seed. Both plant it, one grows, on does not. The one who’s seed has grown isn’t questioning whether are not the other’s seed was a true apple seed, but rather he questions whether or not he planted anything at all.

## By Faith Naaman Was Cleansed In Water

There was a fellow by the name of Naaman. Naaman had leprosy, and in obedience, his obedience demonstrated faith, he went to the water seven times and washed, and he was cleaned. What is your leprosy? What is it that you would do anything to be cleaned of? And if someone said, “go climb this mountain and acquire this plant and eat it and you will be cleansed,” you would do it. But Christ just says believe. We don’t want to hear about this glorious grace. Some of us need something hard to do before we will have faith that we will be cleansed, but Christ just says believe. Believe. Just wash seven times and your leprosy will be healed. Just believe in me, and all your sin will be cleansed.

#  Liberal Issues

## Teach The Poor To Cast Their Nets

 Extreme poverty will never cease from the world as long as Christians are only willing to become poor with those who have nothing. I’ve seen ministries that give up everything they have to feed children, until their money runs out so they suck it out from other Christians and Churches who think they are helping solve a problem in the world. The truth is, Jesus fed 5,000 people with 2 loaves of bread and 5 fish. But he also told Simon Peter to cast his net on the right side of the boat. If all we ever do is supplement the need for food day by day, nobody will learn to cast their nets. It’s our job to teach, to equip, and to eliminate the cause of poverty instead of the effects of poverty. Only then will the poor cease from the world.

## Woman’s Role In The Church

Paul said in 1 Cor. 14 that the command for women to be silent was from the Lord, not from culture. Jesus didn’t really care about cultural traditions. He refuted them because they often violate God’s commands (Mark 7). So no, I don’t think he would make women be silent _in church_ to preserve a cultural tradition. The only times you see a cultural tradition being preserved or commanded on is if it is in accordance with God’s command and for the sake of unbelievers (i.e. no braided hair to preserve chastity).

## Woman Should Not Have To Work

I don’t want women to have to work. That was man’s curse, not yours. Yours was pain in childbirth.

## Porn Users Know How To Love Better Then Christians

 I met a young woman one time at a resort in Florida, and we were talking about whatever new theology I had been studying, and she was intrigued by it and shared that she had never met someone who could talk about Christianity without trying to persuade her that she is a sinner and needs redemption. At that point I wasn’t certain how to respond, so I just said, …. She told me she was a porn star, and if googled Mia Khalifa I would find her on the internet very quickly. She said that being successful in the porn industry is all about convincing your audience that you want sex; that you enjoy it, that you seek it. I said, “That isn’t the case?” She said no. I asked, “Then why do you do it?” Expecting her to respond with something like she has bills to pay, but this is what she said: It’s very profound, she said, “It’s all I’m worth.” It’s the only place that anybody has ever told me I’m worth something, and this is why. It’s the only place somebody says I want you, you are sufficient. We live in a world that is so animate to tear people apart, that they seek worth, value, identity, in the only people who will tell them that they’re wanted, and that’s not Christians; it’s porn users. You see, Christians spent their time trying to tell her that she’s a sinner, that she’s not good enough, and why would she want any part of that?

# Lessons From Life

## My Transition From High School To College In The Church

In high school I loved the church. I would go to youth group every week and we liked interacting with each other, and there was this synergy in the Sunday school classroom, and we loved tackling the scriptures and challenging each other. I would go there every week and I was encouraged in my faith, and we had “homework” for the week and got to share what we learned or what we experienced and that encouragement spilled over into other people and the whole thing overflowed in to worship. Then I graduated. It didn’t seem like the transition would be as drastic as it was, but it was like taking the Israelites out of Israel into Babylon for seventy years. I’m in a foreign place now. I don’t speak the same language; I’m not accustomed to their way of doing things. But it was a little bit different then the Babylonian exile, because when I went, the one other senior in my class went to college and all the juniors who were in my class stayed in youth group. I was all alone, forced to go where I didn’t belong by virtue of getting older and not going off to a university. There wasn’t a place for me anymore. There was no one else in my class except me and my older siblings. Every week was a quarrel between me and the teacher about our doctrine, and he was more interested in showing me that he was right and I was wrong (without scripture and arguments without bases I might add) then studying the scriptures. That’s the problem with old people, they are so set on their indoctrinated beliefs that they aren’t open to examine what the scriptures actually say. When I showed Russell, my former teacher, Exodus 33:11 after examining whether or not a human could see the face of God, he happily conceded and was proud of me (which was encouraging I might add). Kevin, my new teacher would only say, “But think about it; if Moses could behold the face of God, don’t you think we could too?” Huh? That doesn’t even make sense! Just examine the actual passage and justify the scriptures instead of trying to justify your doctrine. I felt like I had the better arguments, but he always managed to leave me with the impression that I was stupid (which discouraged me for the record). This was the place that Northlake said I belonged. I couldn’t go to the older people’s classroom because I was not old. We had a visitor one day who came and asked where college and career met, and one of our members told him this might not be the church for him. What? If you’re telling him we don’t want him here because of his age, I’m not really feeling welcome. I’m young too! Where are we supposed to go? If ever I visited the old people’s class, sure a couple of people would say they’re happy to see me, but what about the rest? There’s one person in the room who doesn’t want me there, who thinks, “This is the wrong church for you.” And I don’t know who all shares his viewpoint, but it doesn’t really matter because all it takes is one person to make me feel unwelcomed. And the worst part is that they won’t say a word to me. Judgment is silent. If it’s spoken, it’s discussion, it’s rebuke, it’s open and okay and I can deal with it. But judgment doesn’t speak. So know I’m going around evaluating everyone saying, “Well he doesn’t look happy to see me.” And so now I’m judging what other people might be thinking, and that’s wrong judgment so now I’m sinning, so it’s just like, “I’ve got to get out of here.” And the irony is that most people would say that one person was wrong to say this is the wrong church for the young, but he was right. I have trouble engaging in a classroom of people older, wiser, more experienced than me. I don’t know why, maybe a psychologist can tell you but all I know is that I’m active with people my age and I just sit there in a classroom where I am the only person below thirty-five. I always heard the statistics that three out of every four kids leave the church when they get out of high school. Big surprise? Oh three out of four kids leave church after high school? I can see why!

## My Paragraph In Mom’s Christmas Letter

Every year my mom sends out a Christmas card to our family connections with a summary of what we’ve been up to during the year. Each of us have our own paragraph devoted to briefing the most important events in our year. Looking at mine in 2015, the main highlight was converting VHS tapes to digital media. Hardly a glorious culmination of my time over the year. It caused me to ask, “Does my identity really consist of something so trivial? Converting VHS tapes?” That’s what people say about me because that’s what people see in me. As I reflected on the past year, I couldn’t produce a better summery than the one given. I had many good intentions. My main goal over the year was to grow. To grow in stature, wisdom, favor with man, and favor with God. I had a little checklist of things to do each day that would contribute toward those goals. Working out, reading, praying, intently studying and memorizing the scriptures, and so on. But at the end of the day, there was yet nothing to show for the garden I was tending. I developed a healthier lifestyle, true, but there’s nothing particularly salient about that. As far as wisdom goes, I don’t suppose I’ve heightened myself terribly much in that area. Having neglected reading and classical music, I’ve been listening to a lot of syncopated music releasing opiates in my brain, which allegedly stupefies its object. As well as a number of other millennial activities that cause damage to the brain in the same way that drugs do. No green checkmark for the psychological area of development. As far as favor with man, I’ve become fairly sociable to strangers that have no connections to me, but anyone related to my journey of teen-hood is not compatible with me. Something beyond my understanding inhibits me from being what they judge me to be. I hide what I’m striving toward from them. I am detestable to my family with some exception. I try to hide my colors from those who can disagree. If I say I love God, witnesses of my behavior have grounds to contend. A hypocrite is one who acts in contradiction to his or her stated beliefs or feelings. I couldn’t bear to state my beliefs and feelings to someone who can evaluate them and weigh evidence so as to disprove me. “You have a tendency to say you’ll do things but not actually do them.” Words from 2011 which I have still not forgotten. And, also, applied to a situation where it held up with perfect scrutiny. Anna wanted me to sell her college books online for a 10% share in the money, and I never did so. Haven’t I excelled since then? It doesn’t matter. She has a lifetime of choices I’ve made to point to, and therefore anything I say in contradiction to the principle of those choices will render me a hypocrite, unless followed by an epiphanic experience I’ve had since then, which I cannot pin point. I can’t say I’m a leader to someone who has seen me ditch the crew. I can’t say I’m a godly man to someone who has heard me doubt the legitimacy of the American Church, which I belong to. I can’t initiate a time of worship, study, and prayer to someone who has judged me to have no relationship with the Lord. I can’t explain why I’m doing the dishes for someone else to a person who has seen my laziest moments. Instead of the truth, that God has softened me and humbled me to the point that I overflow with joy in acts of service to Him and those He has called, I concoct an excuse that preserves their judgment of me, because “it somehow made sense for me to do them, and therefore it wasn’t a noble gesture.”  Lastly and most fundamentally, favor with God. I haven’t been in love with His word, meditating on it and applying my heart to it. It has been a chore, as much as I’ve tried to avoid that approach to it. It has been a losing battle against sin over the year, again promoting hypocrisy in my life. There must be over a hundred pages of prayers I’ve recorded over the year, not to bring up the many hours of audio, but mostly articulating how far away from God I am. All of this causes me to dwell on the question, “What do you want to be written about yourself next year?” How can I become a person who has changed not only in heart, but in the perception of those who have good reason to doubt it?

## I Don’t Have A Humble Voice

 We could talk about it theologically, but I’m going to talk about it practically instead. I want to change who I am, the sort of person I’m becoming: the way I use words, the way I budget my time. Chruch is a bad influence on me for that. I see Kevin, with his head held high and his words loud and I’m becoming him. You called me condescending one time, it’s because church is shaping me, and I don’t want that imprinted on my heart. It changes who I am before people and it kills who I am before God. You called me condescending, I believe, because of the sort of person I am. People have a composition of voices relative to their character. I want a humble-pathos-appealing voice, but I don’t have one. I lift my voice I sound condescending, and I don’t have another loud voice in my inventory. When I speak quietly, people say, “What?” to no end. To sound humble, I have to mumble. In 2011 no one called me condescending. I was depressed, and I spoke quietly. I want to find a humble voice that speaks clearly, and I have to develop a certain character to do that, and I can’t develop that character with church influencing me the way it is now.

## Getting Older Is Like:

Getting older before you grow up is a challenge. There is less forgiveness, less understanding, more expectations, more pressure, less time because we are so much less limited in the things that take up that time. Less movies, less playing, more pornography, more opinions and arguments, more temptations, more guilt, more shame, more havoc, less energy, more hopelessness, less help, less love, more words, more anger, more resentment, more corruption because we know more and care less, less video games, less YouTube videos, no youth group, no place in the church, no encouragement, less trust, more decisions, less brightness, more darkness, less morning, more night, more dishes, more music, less appreciation, less laughter, less family, less crying, more callousness, less honesty, more masks, less openness, less open emotions, more burdens, more assignments, more deadlines, more projects, less passion, more passionate, more self-aware, less care-free, less caring, more wants, more debt, more rules, more rebellion, more judgment, less dreams, more fantasies, more blaming, less apologizing, more problems, less friends, more tools, more people, more defensiveness, . . . . We’re all waiting to be released.

#  Homosexuality

I really don’t like the word homophobe. I’m not scared of people who embrace the homosexual lifestyle. I’m scared for them. I hope a brother can understand the difference.

## Why Does God Prohibit Homosexuality?

Rules are essentially made so that people can live together. If you’re the only one living in your house, rules won’t protect you from someone else leaving their stuff around. In a house with two people, communication can replace consensus. Rules are useful for the purpose of regulating somebody’s actions to offend or hurt another person, or misuse their intentions, such as using a book to fuel a fire. That’s not what I gave the book to you for! I wanted you to read it, not use it for fire wood.

# Short Mantras

Ø  I’m not dead yet, and I will use every fiber in my body and soul to discern and accomplish the will of God.

Ø  I’ve got to be intentional about the way I spend my time, or else I end up just letting life happen to me, and that’s just asking the devil to play.

Ø  I’ve noticed that the times when I pursue God the most is when I’m unsure if I am going to hell or not.

Ø  Many times I have repeated the cycle of sin, and this is what I have learned: Don’t give Satan the smallest chance. Do what’s right, not what’s easy. Set your mind to health, not to taste. Devote yourself to pleasure in God.

Ø  There is a part of my body that delights in food that makes my whole body suffer. Give strength to my mind over the impulses of my tongue. In the things I eat, in the things I watch, in sin.

Ø  Do not invite a man at a table of meat to a dinner of vegetables.

Ø  People spend 15,000 hours of their life preparing to work for 80,000 hours. If you don’t have a mind to prepare you’ve lost the battle before it even started.

Ø  Comparisons are odious. It is better to be lonely with oneself then to be lonely with friends.

Ø  The average house in America has three Bibles. Our problem isn’t getting it out, it’s getting it in.

Ø  The word of God is flowing and living like an enchanted creek.

Ø  Just because atheism permits Dawkins no meaningful answer does not at all show that the question itself is not meaningful.

# Backwards Theology About God

## If All Of God’s Attributes Were Infinite, It Would Be A Limitation

The ironic part of putting God in the box of infinite in His attributes is that it limits Him. God can’t get tired of relenting because He is infinite in patience and mercy. But He can. God can. He is more real and limitless than most if us are taught to believe.

# Marriage, Modesty, And Sex

## Disneferian Philosophy

“You must not marry for advantage. You must marry for love.” I don’t believe in love. I’ve never known it. I’ve never seen it. It’s as much a fairy tale as “happily ever after.” Deluded people experiencing pheromones and oxytocin. Love is nothing more than a chemical, if more, than a choice. Not magic, no. The word love is much like . . . People need something to hope for, something to believe in. Nobody will ever get what they really want. If you marry for love, you’ll divorce for lack of it.

I’m tripping up, God, I can feel temptation pulling on my heartstrings. They come undone. I hate the thing it’s telling me to do. I don’t want to do it, but I want to do it. It will be for depression; it will leave me feeling empty. It will drain my joy; it will place me on my knees in repentance. I don’t want to go there, God, I want to walk in Your ways. She doesn’t speak to me in words, how do I refute her? Show me, God, I don’t want to sin. She will cast me down like a lifeless corpse. She will slay my spirit like a loveless stone. What is this desire, God? Why do I want her? Speak Your word to me, let me receive it. Let me do what is better. Cause me to stand uprightly. Don’t let me grow apathetic in the care of my Father. I’m am being attacked, this is a battle. I can’t afford to sit back and do nothing. Make me Gideon’s army, Lord. You are faithful, may I be faithful. Though I fight, You fight for me. Though You fight, I draw my sword, lest I be slain by this deceiver who seeks to devour me. Teach me Your ways, oh Lord. Teach me what faith is. For though it is You who gives victory to those who trust in You, yet You withhold it from those who slumber and become the prey of the prowling lion. I will gird up my loins for battle, do not let her take me! I’m still weary and fearful, be to me a refuge of strength. The arrows are flying, give me faith to distinguish them. The swords are drawn, instill Your words in me. Do not let me be captured by her eyelids! Hear the voice of my plea for mercy, when I cry out to You for help, when I lift my hands toward Your most holy sanctuary. Do not let me go down to the grave. Hear my petition. I have seem her breasts, yet I did not search for them, nor did I gaze upon her beauty, but I turned my eyes away. Yet my mind returns to it like Lot’s wife to Sodom. Forgive me, let the eyes of my mind be closed to all impurity in me.

It simply is not societal to consider activities that are only consistent with the interests of one individual. The event in question may have conflicts with another person’s interests, and therefore to demands events that align with only your preference is inconsiderate, which is dehumanizing to the victims of ignorance.

Vengeance is mine, declares the Lord almighty, I will repay evil for evil. How do you think you will escape judgment for this wrong against me?

I had a dream. Someone called me on my old Samsung Rant. The name said, “Hannah,” so I answered and there were two phones connected. I never figured out who they were, but we had a lively conversation. When I hung up I came across an old voicemail from Dylan. Salah. The picture was of republic commando, since we played it together. Listening to it, I nearly cried in nostalgia for our times together with him, me, and Chris. Calling each other to see if we were at church, going in the dark halls that nobody else knew about. We were friends. I miss that.

The dream proceeding that one was thus: we were at home at night. Looking out the south-west window of our home (Reminisce alert! When we were looking out Brian’s window and he spotted something we couldn’t identify, and he called it the Holy Ghost). There was a green reindeer made of leaves. We ran out to drive it away, but it was already gone. I levitated again with my phone (#suicideselfie) and took of video of myself flying in the dark.

There was a purple house Deborah used to have, and we would play with it together. I’ve probably told her to get rid of it (and rightly so), but I very much miss having the imagination and excitement of younger ages.

Listen carefully Christian, if an unbeliever can look at your life, and not pity you, I just want to be clear here, you.have.not.recieved 

Paul says here in chapter fifteen, “If we have hoped in Christ in this life only, we are of all men most to be pitied.” Yeah, because friends, I said no to pornography. But if this is all there is, go for it! Live it up! Don’t deny yourself, don’t withhold pleasure from being yours. Gain the world! I guarantee you when I google search “tree” to get a clipart for my sermon jams and I come across a picture of a naked woman sitting on a tree, I’m don’t look away because I’m thinking in the back of my mind, “This will damage my brain. This will cause dopamine to be regulated so that I will have a dopamine hangover afterword. This will cause me to be depressed and lethargic.” Don’t get me wrong, there are advantages in this life to saying no to pornography, but they are not strong enough to turn an unrighteous person like myself away from it. It’s too powerfully enjoyable. When I see her beauty on that screen, there is only one thing that empowers me to look away and that is the promise of the all-satisfying beauties and wonders and majesties of Christ when those whom He has called to Himself finally enter the fullness of His glory. The pleasures we will receive in Jesus will infinitely surpass the pleasures of sin. That’s what I have in mind when I say no to pornography. The reward of God after I die. But if this is all there is, pity me. Because I denied myself. I denied the quick pleasures of the world. If there’s nothing to look forward to, I gave up something good for nothing in return. Pity me. Pity me because after I worked a forty-hour week, I didn’t buy that new wake-up light I wanted. I didn’t upgrade my computer. I didn’t climb Maslow’s hierarchy because I saw some kids in Uganda who hadn’t even established the first level, and I gave my money to them instead of looking out for number one. Pity me because in fifty years when all my peers are living off of their hard earned retirement, I’ll be praying, “Give me this day my daily bread,” because I chose to feed a hungry child who wouldn’t have otherwise made it to his adulthood. None of that makes any sense if there’s nothing after this life. Compassion is just a prolonging of what’s coming. Pity me because while you were off enjoy a luxurious resort on vacation, I was clearing the debris of communities who lost everything from a tornado. Pity me because I suffered in this life, I carried the burdens of those who were afflicted, and if there is nothing afterword I missed out on the best things in life. But it’s not like that here in America, is it? We’re living the good life. We’re pilling up retirement, we don’t really have to trust God, and if there isn’t anything after this life, we didn’t really miss a thing. Don’t pity the Americans. We’re living it up. We’re better off then unbelievers even if we’re wrong, because we had more pleasure, more blessings, more money, and better quality of life than anybody on earth. I mean let’s be honest, why should I be pitied more than an unbeliever in Europe making 2 dollars a day? Even if there is no resurrection, the average American is making 100 times that. Tell me again who’s supposed to be pitied, Paul? Me? That only makes sense if I live my blessings out to the world. You say, “Well God just hasn’t made me suffer,” there is somebody who is suffering. And when one member suffers, the whole body suffers. You don’t have a burden, carry somebody else’s.

Don’t feed the lust of your heart when it cries from hunger, my son. Though she performs her craft with diligence, do not be captivated by her eyes. Do not believe her sounds of pleasure, nor let her act of lust deceive you, for she spreads her legs on a hard table only in the interest of the her audience. She let’s a stranger violate her, and men she doesn’t know gaze upon her nakedness. She toils to maintain her body, and labors to entice young men. It is not pleasant for her, nor does she delight in her snare, yet her victim’s will never be released, nor will they return to the paths of life. Guard your heart from her voice, and turn your eyes from her beauty. Commit you heart to purity, and let your eyes see clearly in front of you. Sex is not the culmination of our pleasure, but a mere metaphor. Be wise, young brother, and do not give yourself to corruption.

Remember when we were kids and the worries of the world had nothing to do with us? Now days I have a rush of euphoria maybe once a month if that much.  One of the things that makes me exhilarated is playing video games with Brian and Caleb. It’s gets intense. I’m yelling, they’re yelling, we’re all laughing, and for a moment nothing else matters. But when we were young everyday was like that. Lego’s, gameboys, mostly outside games, spy, building cards, video games, this was how we spent all our hours and we spent it with friends. Something inside us as adults is trying to get back to that paradise, trying to restore our best memories. I had a brief dream where everything around me slowly evaporated, and I began falling toward the edge of a sphere of silver water with air bubbles. Somehow it was perfect, because I was falling toward God. What if we could find that climactic happiness again? No worries, no stress, just fun. Jesus said He has spoken that His joy may be in us and our not might be full. This promise is the answer to me question. But our first question is, “yeah, but that’s joy… I just want to be happy.” Too many poachers have downplayed the word joy to mean something like self-chosen contentment during times of crises. And so now we have this nagging feeling that joy is not as gratifying as happiness. But what if that isn’t the case? What if joy is something more euphoric than happiness?

What causes what some people have referred to as “Jesus bumps”? One of the three main stimuli identified with goosebumps is strong emotions. Most of us have experienced what it is to get goosebumps when we’re cold, but some of us have experience the same sensation during a moving song or conversation with religious connotations. It feels like our spirit is stirred within us, or the Holy Spirit is coming into our body. It’s a compelling sensation that we like to recognize as God’s Spirit moving us, but perhaps more candidly it is explained by simple laws of chemistry and physics. When the muscle fiber connected to a hair follicle tightens, the skin surrounding the follicle contracts into a goose bump, pulling the connected hair straight up. This causes that “spirit leaving or entering me” feeling. The same sensation is experienced with fear and other emotions unrelated to the Christian God. It could occur with the right music during a horror film, or with any number of other epiphany-like sentiments. [[1]](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-humans-get-goosebu/)

Wisdom isn’t something you merely hear and assess to be wise. It’s something you can see in a person’s life. Yu can see wisdom in the way people manage their affairs, their space, their time, their money.

I respect and appreciate a dress-up church. In my case we were just poor. I didn’t have anything to wear so I felt out of place at church. I decided then and there I will never be a dress-up church.

In Arrow Season 4, the main villain kills one of his men to make a point about how he deals with disappointment. He takes the life of one of his own people for the mere purpose of delivering a message. We look at that and say, “That’s sick!” And then we read Ezekiel 24 and see God doing something analogous, killing the wife of His prophet as a sign to Israel that they will lose their heart’s delight. We don’t know what to do with that. We had no idea God wasn’t a sissy. We thought we was some kind of pushover, but don’t get it twisted, God will not be mocked.

What if we had a neighborhood of people who were willing to drop everything to do church the way it began? People who would say to their children, “I know there’s this new toy or gadget that you want, but so and so need shelter and food right now,” or,  “somebody just got in a car wreck and needs support,” or, “There’s a whole world or there that needs what this money can buy just to survive another day.” This is what is means when the scriptures say when one member suffers the whole body suffers alike. It’s a whole community sharing in each other’s burdens, not counting anything as their own but giving to each one as they have need. And I’m not talking about communism here, but a people who are motivated and led to willingly give of themselves and labor by the Spirit of God and what He speaks through His book. A people who are all walking so closely with God that their natural behavior is the God exalting human loving way to act. And you have kids growing up in that community? It would change everything. What if instead of doing weekly services and calling it a wrap, we met daily in each other’s homes? There’s enough media and services recorded that we could all even watch a sermon together everyday on the same page as we fellowship. What if church was our recreation? We are, after all, recreated. Instead of parties we do church. Instead getting drunk or movies we do sermons. Instead of all the trivial things we put most of our time into that will have no significance in a thousand years, we walked together day by day in the power and wisdom of the Holy Spirit. I know everybody is busy, but most of us are busy with triviality. What if we got busy for the Kingdom? If someone has to work during church fellowship time, someone can catch her up when she’s home, or there could be a network of schedules so she can meet with other people who have the same free time as her. How did the early church do it? They had much less technology then we do, less efficient means of production. If they could be one body of believers, so can we.

For we are taking pains to do what is right, not only in the eyes of the Lord but also in the eyes of man. – Pitied

## Sex Is Not Recreation, It’s Procreation

 I think pretty much everyone agrees that the taking of life is a very serious matter, but increasingly it seems we do not see the giving of life in proportionate seriousness. God gave us the ability to create eternal souls, and we use it for recreation. It’s so much more important than a bonding agent for a family.

## If You’re Not In Business, Don’t Advertise

God designed the system pretty simple: the man looks at the woman’s body, gets excited, and that causes the whole process of starting making children. The whole animal kingdom is that way, which is why it’s important how women dress. If you’re not in business, don’t advertise. If you attract them with your body you will lose them when you don’t have that body. What happens when you get sick or old?

## Our Adulterousness Is Disgusting

Is it wrong for a thirty-year-old man to have an affair with a five-year-old girl? Let’s say she just outright loves it--is it right? Why? If because she’s too young to make decisions about something so important when she’s that young--so what, it’s not a big deal when your old but it is when you’re young? I think we all realize what a huge deal this is, how absolutely disgusting and horrific this is. We can’t answer the question “why,” but we don’t have to because we know it’s wrong. If a faint imagery wanders by we flinch in disturbed judgment. That’s so horrible, just inconceivable. That’s how God saw Sodom, and that’s probably how God sees fornicators.

## Argument

 Anna, you asked me what I thought about marriage in a theological application to law. I didn’t say anything on my own initiative, you asked. I told you what I thought, “marriage doesn’t come from the power of a minister. When the scriptures say they become one, it’s a biochemical reality. Adam and eve weren’t married by an ordained minister; the ring didn’t make her his wife. Marriage isn’t an abstract idea, it’s a oneness.” To which you replied, “but somewhere in the Bible it says marriage is a covenant before God.” To which I replied, “is it? Where?” To which you replied, “I don’t know off the top of my head, but I have a book about it.” I asked for biblical support, and you gave me none. You said, “I have a book about it at home.” Is that a compelling argument? Should I have at that point said, “Oh okay, you have a book. I guess you were right then”? You didn’t bring anything to the table. “I’ve read a book” isn’t sufficient for me to concede to your argument. Now, when you make the claim that something is in the Bible, you can provide evidence with a reference. But when somebody challenges that claim to say something isn’t in the Bible, there is no evidence I can present because I don’t bear the burden of proof. So I presented the only evidence I could and said, “I don’t remember that phrase in the Bible,” that is the only thing I can say. Instead of saying, “Well Paul speaks on the matter in such and such passage,” you said, “you don’t have the whole Bible memorized.” To which I responded, “I’m usually not wrong when people say things are on the Bible and I don’t recognize it. People say all the time that love the sinner hate the sin is in the Bible, along with this too shall pass. But they’re not.” To which you replied, “I’m pretty sure that has nothing to do with whether or not marriage is a covenant before God.” And thereafter got angry at me.

In essence you asked what I thought, I told you, you said I was wrong, I asked for a reason, you didn’t give one, I said I was right, and you were offended that I didn’t change my theology in spite of your lack of support.

## Marriage

The purpose of marriage is for the man to show how Christ loves and gave Himself up for the church, and for the woman to show how the church is supposed to behave towards Christ. So you’ve got a couple, and the woman does something terrible to the husband. Sleeps with another man. You think, “Well, I’m going to raise my voice to you and call you nasty names and leave you.” Wrong. You cry. You cry for your wife because you’re hurt for her, not by her. You don’t leave her, you love her. It’s not that you don’t care, you do care, but that’s why you stay faithful. She screws you over and you say I still love you unconditionally and absolutely, and nothing you ever do to hurt me is going to change that. That’s a man’s role in a marriage. A woman’s role is to show how the church is supposed to behave toward Christ. Paul says, “Shall we go on sinning, that grace may increase?” By no means! Why? Well, you can point to that marriage as an example. He still loves her even though she screwed him over. Should she just say, “Oh, well in that case I’m just going to sleep around with everybody.” You’d say of course not. Even after she cheated on him he stayed faithful. She shouldn’t cheat on him; she should stay faithful to him. Bingo. You got it. That’s how we behave with Christ. And a wife’s job is also to represent another thing. Christ is the head. Right? He has authority over us, and the husband has authority over the wife. So the church isn’t supposed to cross our arms and say, “Okay, I guess I’ll submit to you.” We love to do what Christ asks of us because we know that he loves us absolutely and unconditionally. So the wife is supposed to be an image of that with her husband. She doesn’t shake her fist at him, she delights to do what he asks of her, because he loves her. The wife must respect her husband. When he asks her to do something she does not want to do, come on guys. When Christ asks something of us, we do it. We do it. We don’t neglect Him. We don’t deprive Him. And the wife does not deprive her husband.

All right, let’s go back to Genesis 2. God says, “Adam, you need a helper. You’ve got a lot on your plate, you need help.” So they bring every animal before Adam, and none of them were suitable. None of them were good enough. He brings over a rhinoceros, “Ehh, thumbs would be useful.” He brings over a monkey, “Yeah (reluctantly) but isn’t she a bit hairy?” So God says, “You know what? I’m going to do something really special, I’m going to make another you.” 1 Corinthians 11 says man was created in the image and glory of God and woman was created in the glory of man. So Adam wakes up and says, “Bone of my bone. I’m looking at myself. This will work.” Because if you read the passage it says God took a side of Adam, a rib, that’s the feminine side of him, and created Eve. Adam can no longer represent God by himself, because he was split in half. You have this part of God’s nature in a man, and this part of God’s nature in a woman. And when both parts come together, and are joined so that God’s image is fully seen and perfectly represented, life comes out of it. Life happens when God’s glory is reconstructed in the relationship of a man and a woman. That is really, really special. That’s not recreation, that’s re-creating God’s image and glory. It’s not for fun, it’s to show something, and what you are showing is beyond fun. 95% of people don’t get this. They just get married and it’s all about them. That’s not okay. Marriage isn’t about you, it’s about a God who loved us so much that He sent his only begotten Son, His Son left His Father to be joined with his bride, the church. That’s what marriage is about, that’s the story marriage is telling, and when you make it about yourself all of that goes away. “For this reason it says a man shall leave his father and be joined to his wife and become one flesh with her. This mystery is great, but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the Church.” This is what marriage is for.

When we put on a ring, that’s nothing compared to the marriage bed. It’s just a symbol. Well, the marriage bed is the symbol that Christ uses to talk about what we will enjoy with Him in His Kingdom. Sex is basically the most pleasurable thing, the highest, ultimate good we shoot for on earth, and Christ says that is zero compared to what’s about to happen when you meet me in the clouds. The marriage bed is nothing in comparison.

Attractiveness is supposed to symbolize something too. But we won’t get into that. Basically, one person gets pleasure, the other person gets honor. Men have about 20 times as much testosterone as woman, and that enables us to see something we like and go take it. Attraction for a male means I see something that I like, and I’m going to go take it. Attraction for a woman is not based on testosterone, but on estrogen. Estrogen works differently. Woman don’t like what they see and go take it, they want to be liked and taken. They’re trying to impress. Men give something to get sex, and women give sex to get something. You could call it affection maybe. Woman want affection, but the underlying principle is that when a man wants a woman, that means she’s valuable, and that is what drives a woman to want a man. She wants to be valuable, whereas the man just wants what he likes. These neurochemicals that drive behavior are a little bit different. Now women still have a little bit of testosterone, so they can understand a little bit of the attraction men feel, but it’s on a whole different scale. What does this have to do with Jesus? God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him. We get satisfied, we take something, and God gets valued by it. God gets glory from that.

If the guy you like came to, let’s say it’s valentine’s day, and he says to you, “Noel, I want to spend the evening with you, and so I’ve made some arrangements because nothing makes me happier than to spend the night with you.” Would it enter your mind to say, “You are so selfish. All you ever think about is what would make your evening great, what would make you happy.” No, right? Why wouldn’t you respond that way? Because you get the glory and he gets the pleasure. And that’s the way it is with us and God. God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him. God gets the glory; we get the satisfaction. We reserve evenings. We make provisions for the Spirit.

## The Adulterer Has No Inheritence

 If those who are saved have an inheritance in the Kingdom of God and Christ, and we know with certainty that the adulterer has no inheritance in this, if you commit adultery one of two things is true: Either you are an adulterer before men but not counted as an adulterer before God, or you are counted as saved before men but you are not saved by God.

# Temporary Reference

## Sexual America                                                                 

We live in a nation that is _bent_ on sexuality. The first movies I ever watched had sexual facets. Lion king has Nala and Simba. White Christmas accommodated two main romances. It’s A Wonderful Life wouldn’t be as wonderful without his wife. Even Toy Story has Woody and Little Boa Peep, as well as Buzz and Wendy. Not to mention most guys I know loved the Princess Diaries 1 & 2. From the moment that kids are introduced to TV entertainment, scripts are being written in our heads about what people fight for in life. Even in literature. An entire war was fought over a woman’s breasts, namely Helen of Troy. And of if this is an analog to our lives. So we start to understand early on that this sexual relationship between a man and a woman is one of the primary goals in life. People in movies make it out to be the ultimate end, saying things like, “I never wanted the world. I just want you.” Dramas like that start to shape a mentality in us that more important and more desirable than owning the world is owning the heart of the person who owns yours. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Even the writer of Hebrews tells us to honor the marriage bed. Another word for honor is lift up, or elevate, so elevating sex isn’t a bad thing. My first concern is that all of this elevating without commentary of its good and proper context serves as the primer for its distortion later on in life. My second concern is that it defeats Paul’s efforts in 1 Corinthians 7 to encourage individuals to stay single. His logic is that when you are married you are concerned with how to please your spouse, which divides your commitment to the Kingdom with your commitment to her. And he’s not talking about a situation analogous to Solomon’s where his wives lead him away from God. He’s talking about an undistracted devotion to the work of God that is interrupted by your duty to your family. . . . What all of this looks like in a typical teenagers day is, he can either listen to a song that stirs his affections for God, or a song that stirs his enticement toward the current girl he’s attracted to. It’s very easy to listen to “Talk Dirty To Me” when you have her in mind, instead of “Our God.” It’s easy to go to sleep with fantasies of her rather than praying as you fall asleep. It’s easy to spend money trying to impress her rather than using it in such a way that shows Christ is your treasure. It’s easy to think of ways to keep your relationship with her adventurous and active rather than thinking of ways to keep your relationship with God adventurous and active. It’s easy to talk to an imaginary version of her that doesn’t hear me (when I’m walking alone or looking in the mirror) rather than praying to the true God who does hear me. . . . What needs to happen is a rewiring of ourselves to make God our highest, deepest, first, most satisfying, priority taking treasure so that when you wake up your first thought is about Him. I need to rewire myself so that I’m no longer wasting time thinking about sexual muses. I need a mindset that doesn’t say, “You need to get the kind of job that pays well so you can first entice her and second support her.” If I get a job to pay well, or a tongue that persuades well, it’s going to be for God’s purpose. To feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, to care for the orphan and the widow, to advance Christ’s kingdom here, to build an Eco city as a more efficient quality of living, but most importantly for the spread of the gospel that nobody will be left without a hope in the one true God. If I don’t get a job that pays well, I’m still living for Him. Worlds aren’t changed with money, they’re changed with words that are planted and when fully grown produce decisions. . . . I have this weird propensity, that I’m not sure if is normal or not, to have these imaginary conversations with whatever girl has captured my affections. I’ll get socks out of my drawer and say, “Let me just get socks, because my feet are cold.” That needs to change into prayer. The person you talk to when nobody is around needs to shift from imaginary person to God.

## Clearly Perceived                                                            

I love studying by a window at night or in the morning. As I’m reading the words that the Spirit are speaking I can look out the window and hear all of creation testifying _loudly_, “Creator! Power! Majesty!” I can’t separate the two. I see a tree and I think, “God made that!” I see the stars and my heart says, “What a majestic designer!” I see the expanse of the heavens and my mind hears, “He’s big! He’s glorious! He’s powerful!” I can’t separate the words from their meaning. I can’t separate what I see from who put it there. God is the blessed Creator forever! Amen.

## Clearly Perceived                                                            

Sometimes things that people do that neglect the commands of scripture seem so obvious to me that it catches me off guard when people challenge it. It’s like, here I am judging myself so strictly for some unwholesome word that slipped out of my mouth, and I have to really come before the Lord and confess and say, “I really didn’t these people right, Lord.” And I have this time of being humbled and chastised by God, because I know it was wrong. And then I see somebody else straight up curse another person over something trivial, like taking up the right turn lane when he’s just going straight, and they don’t consider it wrong at all. To me it almost seems like they get a free pass because they don’t think of it as sinning. They aren’t humbled, they don’t confess, they aren’t chastised, and they couldn’t be more okay with themselves. I’m like, “Are they good?” This is the burden of knowing scripture. To the one who knows what is right and doesn’t do it, many blows. To the one who doesn’t know what it right, few blows. And something in me almost questions, “What if they are right? What it I’m applying what I take from scripture too extremely to life’s everyday situations?” Whoever knows what to do and does not do it, to him that is sin. But what about the people who aren’t convinced about what is right?

I see the face of a man with bitter hatred. The contempt of his venomous expression shows the magnitude of his disgust and revulsion toward me. For a moment he was nonchalant without a care in the world. In a moment he is filled with disgust and begins to shake in utter revulsion. He looks on what he did and becomes sick in his soul. The mirror loathes him. He looks in hatred.  Do not sell yourself to two masters.

I love the law not because it declares me righteous, but because by it I learned I couldn’t do it without Christ.

When he welcomes you into his world, you have one chance to pay attention. You could conquer worlds with his wisdom, or you could ease a restless soul. There’s something beyond mystery about his music. He responds to few, but the ones he gives words to are changed forever. All of us are curious about him. Who is he? What is the music that the few describe? What are the words too glorious to be written or spoken? Pray to be chosen by the writer.

The energy is born from a star by which it was not created and trapped by a plant to store as plant tissue. This snare for energy, this involuntary enslavement is the source of every lush and green world. The plants are the slave masters. They look beautiful and smell nice, but beware, lest it traps you also.

## Guns Rights                                                                        

… God had Hitler in His sights. His gun was locked, loaded, and ready. Not only did God not kill Him, God gave Hitler his every breath. Isaiah and other passages talk about that. If God, who has the authority over life and death didn’t kill him, it doesn’t follow that I, without the authority over life and death should. I’m not saying defending yourself is wrong, God had cities prepared just for situations like that where a man could flee to stay alive. I’m just saying if it came to a situation where someone was threatening the people I love, I would place my hope in God, not in my holster. Pray in His name. It’s a good test to know whether or not God wants Him killed. I believe in the promises of God, ask whatever you wish and it will be given to you if my words abide in you.

The more I debate atheists, the more I wonder why it is so hard for atheists to confess Jesus’ name. I have seen them jump through hoops to avoid theism. How can you explain design without a designer (teleological argument)? An infinite number of universes (the multiverse “theory”). How do we explain the extreme mathematical probabilities that we just happen to exist in this finely-tuned universe out of the infinite array of other universes on that view? Chance. I have seen atheist give up both science, because the multiverse is an appeal to metaphysics, and rational probability, because the chances of living in this universe on that view are infinitesimal. Why is it so fundamental that God doesn’t exist to the atheist? They would replace him with mindless luck against odds that cannot be rationally faced. It makes me surer of the value in the simple confession, “Jesus is Lord, the Son of God, who was and is and is to come.”

The more I go through life the more I am confident that the world doesn’t need me to display the covenant of Christ with His Church by a covenant between me and another woman. The world has John Piper for that. It doesn’t need another canvas for something that every child has memorized.

I think it’s incredibly egocentric for somebody to tell another person, “I love you,” in the family of Christ sort of way. If it’s the sexual “I love, I get this feeling around you that I can’t shake, I just want to be with you,” kind of way, then okay, you can say that all you want. But to tell somebody you love them with the same love that God loves us, that’s saying, “I’m really patient with you. I’ve been kind to you. Oh, and by the way, I haven’t been keeping a record of your wrongs against me. I basically treat you really well.” . . . No, that’s not something you say to somebody. Either you love them or you don’t, but saying it doesn’t make it true. It’s something that another person has to observe in you, not something you have to tell them. I think if you tell someone, “I love you,” it’s like a promise. It’s a covenant saying, “I am choosing to love you. I mess it up sometimes, and I’ll own up to it when I do, but I am now making a promise to never stop loving you to the best of my ability and with every fiber of strength I have.” That’s a scary commitment to make with three hasty words.

I don’t mind telling you, I’m an extremely unrighteous person. This mind is perverse. I can see the most pure, holy, unadulterous thing online, and it can take me down trail of thoughts that lead me somewhere I don’t want to be. I see a picture from maybe a coquettish girl I know on Facebook, and it’ll make me think, “Ah-ha-ha-hah, I remember her. She was very friendly. She reminds me of Game of Thrones. Game of Thrones reminds me of hot naked women, hot naked women remind me of google, . . .” Or maybe I just see a girl, and I have a script in my head from watching porn that says, _women want sex_; her expressions, her sounds, her positions, it’s all so subjecting and now I’ve inserted that demeanor into my perception of how women behave, and that turns me on. Once I’m turned on, I have a desire, namely to watch a girl want sex, or want to expose herself, or just enjoy her sexuality, and I can do that with the click of a button if there are no guards in my heart that tells me, “Do not do that.” When I’m turned on, chemical releases turn off the prefrontal cortex and you’re in an alpha brain state; the guards are down. I’ve got nothing to tell me, “No.” That is an extremely dangerous situation. To avoid it, I need to avoid whatever it is that turns me out. Whatever stimuli, whatever trigger, even if it starts with something as simple as seeing a friend on Facebook. I’ve got to say “no” before I’m turned on, because it won’t happen after. I’m not that righteous.

Music can be the consummation of your emotions. Sad people listen to sad music. There’s a sense of completing your sadness in the sweet melodies of melancholy; it is sometimes therapeutic and essential for overcoming the sadness, rather than just suppressing it with happy songs and pretending you don’t feel the way that you do.

I had a friend who recently said to me, “You know Ethan, I don’t think there are really 7 billion people in the world. That’s just pure propaganda concocted by the media to make us believe it.” And I thought, “Okay, that’s kind of a weird thing to be skeptical about. I mean, I guess you either believe it or you don’t, but is it really going to make a difference whether or not believe it?” Some things just are not worth our skepticism. “Blessed is the man who sits not in the seat of skeptics.”

If you marry for advantage you’ll divorce for lack of it. If you marry for love you’ll divorce for lack of it. I am not a supporter of fairy-tail, true love, meant to be together, marriages. You do not, you do not, marry for love. And when I say love I mean the emotional kind of love, not the choice kind of love. Because the choice kind of love is unconditional, it means no conditions. In other words I’m not loving you because of you but because of me, and that’s not exclusive to your wife, that’s everybody. You are love; they could do anything against you, and no conditions; you still love them. The reason to get married is not for advantage, the reason to get married is not for love; the reason to get married is to serve as a parable of God’s love and covenant with us so that when people look at you they have some concept of, “That’s what God is offering to me?” And if you make that covenant conditional (i.e. all bets are off if I don’t like you anymore), it’s no longer showing God’s love and covenant for us, and so the marriage in the first place was not for a right reasons.

I have a friend that I’ve known all my life, . .. Josh was his name, he was a great guy, I said I normally wouldn’t approve. . . It devastated me. Divorce really, really, disheartens me. It’s not just, “Somebody lost their mom and dad,” The main offence in a murder is not the offence toward the person you killed. The main offence is toward the God whose infinite dignity you have transgressed. You do not get sent to an eternal hell for a finite crime. God is just.

Natural selection is just a word to fill in the gap of science that can’t explain why animals adapt to their environment.

Is sex drive tethered to the soul of the person of the chemicals of the person? I will wager that I have a greater sex drive than most women, despite their estrogen, because most men have 20 times as much testosterone than women. I think chemicals are the reason for sex drive because Jesus said there is no marriage in Heaven, which means . . . we get separated from our bodies, we no longer have the desire . . . you do the math. There are animalistic qualities that contribute to your decisions by virtue of what you feel. It doesn’t make decisions, it just feels and you make the decision to act on it. When I say no, it’s not because I don’t have a sex drive, it’s because I am looking toward something much greater, beyond the instantaneous pleasures of the world. With pleasure comes depression. Yeah I want pleasure, no I don’t want depression, weigh it out on a scale and let me know what you decide.

Look at the pyramids. It’s made with such precision, such mathematical engineering it baffles the brightest minds today how something so incredible could have been build. Each stone weighing 2.5 tons, pyramiding up using 2.5 million of them, somehow moving such heavy objects in such a way that they don’t fall over before it’s finished. How could this have been built? But you know one theory I have yet to hear? “It evolved over billions of years.” What?! You know the reason I think nobody is claiming that? We all know that obviously something that precise, parallel, meaningful and awesome could not have possibly been the product of random forces. It was designed, and we all know that means there was a designer. And yet we look at all the even more mathematical complexity of DNA, rDNA, and the many anatomical functions of living organisms and say. . . “Yeah, isn’t it cool how this just kind of happened? Natural selection—thank God. Oh wait, I mean thank chance.” Don’t get it twisted, atheists, you know exactly what you’re giving up to deny a Designer of the universe and all it contains. You suppress what has been clearly perceived since the creation of the world. When will you stop?

One of the most confusing relationship dilemmas is asking her to stay. She has wanted to be a CI all her life, and has been accepted to the academy. If she wants you to ask her to stay, do you? On one hand, you want her to stay, but love is selfless so you want what’s best for her and her interests. What will be best for her? You don’t want to presume that you’d be better for her than the academy because that’s pride, and even if she says she wants you more you know that she has wanted the academy all her life and you’ve only been in the equation a short time, and on top of that she can have a much easier life being a CI than being the wife of a nobody making low wages, so you decide to let her go. Meanwhile she’s upset that you haven’t asked her to stay because that implicitly means that you don’t want her or care about her all that much, when in truth it’s because you care about her more than she gives you credit for that you’re not asking her to stay. But she doesn’t just want you, she wants you to want her, and since you seem to not want her she is leaving.

I don’t think anyone marries their perfect mate. In a world of 7 billion people, there is almost certainly someone who is more compatible with you than whoever you’re with. The reason we get married to less than the perfect match is because we’re not patient enough to swim through every water. We not Wyoming to go that far for it.  I marked the girl next store.

This morning my the lust of my heart did a search for its sinful pleasures. What is this if not a reminder that I never was righteous except with the rich righteousness imputed to me by Jesus? Maybe there is cause to mourn, a mourning for the sin of my soul, but let there be sounds of rejoicing, for the cause of morning never went away even while I first raised my voice towards heaven in praise for the grace of God. It’s by Jesus that we’re mage righteous, praise God, not by our staying away from sin. Yes keep praying and battling sin, never surrender, but don’t let it keep you from God. Be humbled and rejoice that you are forgiven.

## Reasonably Unreasonable                                            

 Jonathan Swift, proposing that the starving children of Ireland not only will barely scrape by their miserable lives during their young years, but will grow up to be thieves and criminal members of society. They also wreck the family’s lives by making the mother liable to beg for food to feed her children, at her heels. It is better, he proposes, to sell the children to the meet market. It would eliminate the burden of being raised by families who cannot support their young, which helps the one killed and the one living. To which an American would respond, “We are talking about people here!” Indeed we are, which is why we must not allow them to live such miserable lives. We must ask, what is best for these people? Is death really worse than the life of a cold, naked, hungry, begging, unloved child? Swift’s fundamental flaw is that he appeals to a morality which can only be vindicated by reason, and his reason for the rightness of sparing children a life of misery is contingent on a morality which condemns that kind of life. But where is such a morality grounded? After all, what is really wrong with a miserable life? In his writing, he is clear on his position. . . . What I’m saying is that he doesn’t get rid of an unreasoned morality, he only succeeds in throwing it back one step. For he gives no reason why he thinks it wrong to beat or kick a pregnant wife, or “the horrid practice of women murdering their bastard children.” Why is this wrong? Remember, reason is our only appeal here. There is no other authority to which this man appeals. And therefore if the rightness of killing yearling children depends on the wrongness of letting them live, one must show the wrongness of letting them live to be wrong, which cannot be done. Why is it wrong? Reasonably, because it hurts them. Why is hurt reasonably wrong? I.e., how does it follow from the premise of “Life hurts,” that “Therefore life is morally wrong?” Where is the link there? The link is in the hidden premise, “Whatever hurts is wrong.” The first premise can be shown to be true. The second premise, however, cannot. Whatever hurts is wrong. What makes it wrong to hurt?

His conclusion is that the implementation of this project will do more to solve Ireland’s complex social, political, and economic problems than any other measure that has been proposed.

The rightness of killing yearling children depends on the wrongness of letting them live (which he cites as the complex social, political, and economic problems their lives will cause), and the wrongness of letting them live depends on (all the hypocrites bow down to me!)

I discovered some really cool research on brainwave music synchronisation. When you are fully conscious and thinking hard your brain has between 7 and 24 pulses per second. This is called a beta brain state. In alpha brain state has between four and seven. Anyway in alpha brain state is less conscious but still aware of what’s going on around you. So certain isochronic tones in music can synchronize the pulses in your brain with the music influencing which state you are in. Higher brain states are better for cognitive functions, and lower brain states are better for sleeping and relaxation. Brainwave power music is the producer or creators of a whole bunch of music therapy sounds. They are very science oriented but also seem a little bit crazy, for instance they refer to astral projection, which is the belief that your spirit can leave your body while you’re sleeping and roam around the world.

Hey Aunt Judy! I don’t know if this will be useful to you or not, but last semester I discovered research on brainwave music synchronization. As I understand it, when you are wide awake and alert your brain has between 13 and 40 pulses per second. This is called a beta brain state. An alpha brain state has between 7 and 12, still conscious but more relaxed, theta brain state between 4 and 7, going into deeper relaxation, and finally a delta brain state having 0 to 4 pulses per second, the wave signal of the subconscious. Using this principle, researchers create isochronic tones in music to sync the pulses in your brain with the music, influencing which brain state you are in. Higher brain states are better for cognitive functions, and lower brain states are better for sleeping and relaxation. You can search on YouTube for Brainwave Power Music to access a multitude of music therapy sounds. Anyway, I’ve added some of their stuff to my iPod and it really helps me sleep well. It’s not for everybody, but if you’re interested here is a link to a playlist featured on their YouTube channel.

 but I’ve found that Brainpower Music produces effective sounds for helping me get to sleep. They

Binaural beats compose separate tones to each ear, such that, for example, the left ear receives a frequency of 130 pulses per second and the right ear receives a frequency of 135 pulses per second, causing the brain to mimic the difference resulting in a brain state of 5 pulses per second. This form of brainwave entrainment requires not only stereo audio, but also headphones to deliver the separate tones. They make special headphones for sleeping purposes so that it won’t be uncomfortable (http://brainwavepowermusic.com/other-products).

If you want to avoid the headphones, you could try monaural tones. These beats are combined into one sound and don’t require a left ear / right ear distinction.

Isochronic tones do not require the headphones either, as they are combined into one sound as well. What sets isochronic tones apart from monaural tones is that they produce a pulsing effect by switching on and off. From what I understand, this makes isochronic tones the most effective type of brainwave entrainment. However, since each have different advantages many tracks combine all three to make it as effective as possible.

I have never personally used headphones or listened to the whole track. I set my stereo system to go to sleep after an hour, and usually fall asleep long before then. I also have been reciting scripture as I’m going to sleep which no doubt helps with epinephrine and nor-epinephrine levels (stress hormones).

And that is an excellent question of whether or not it progresses downward from stage to the next. I have wondered that myself. If I had to guess I would say no because I don’t notice any difference in the music throughout the track. But in binaural beats (assuming the difference between the two ears is less than 20 Hz) I wouldn’t notice anyway since the audible human hearing range is 20-20,000 Hz. I suppose it would depend on the track as well. The playlist I linked you has well over 100 tracks, using a variety of the three brainwave entrainment forms.

But never mind all that, it’s for God to grant sleep. I’ve added you to my prayer list. :)

Cheating can be described as sleeping with a body that doesn’t belong to you. When you’re married, your partner’s body becomes one with yours and you own each other. If you’re single, don’t cheat on yourself with your boyfriend or girlfriend.

I wouldn’t recommend any Christians to watch deadpool. Can you say with honesty that seeing nudity does not cause you to sin in your mind?  If you are so sexually callus that seeing a naked body of the opposite sex does nothing to arouse you, there’s a problem. God designed the biochemistry of our brains to be turned on by naked bodies.

If you are given a rule that you cannot say, “Is this scary?” knowledge would say, “Is this frightful,” wisdom would recognize that’s really breaking the rule.

When somebody asks, “Why is it dark in here?” They aren’t asking a question from science. “Well it’s dark because those blinds are preventing enough light from transmitting through for us to see really well.” No, they are asking a question from philosophy. “Why did somebody close the blinds? What is the purpose for which it is dark in here?” Science has no “purpose” answers. It isn’t concerned with intentional states and intelligent causal agents, because there are no predictability rules constraining causal agents. We don’t always act or react in the same ways that physical laws do. There are patterns of behavior, mind you, but these are only observations of how people tend to act or react, they are never always true, so it isn’t a science.

Natural selection really isn’t anything to marvel at. If a pack of wolves move to a colder climate, they’re coats will become thicker. Their bodies are designed to adapt to climate changes. This is called adaptation or micro-evolution. If you spend time in the sun, your skin forms pigment cells to prevent sun burn. (Does this change the genetic information you pass along?) What else is new? The question I’m asking is, what environment would cause an eyeball to evolve from a lifeform without an eyeball? I can chemically understand variations in information that’s already in the organism, but we’re talking about an ear coming from some link between the first prokaryotic cell and the first organism with an ear. How in observation’s name would natural conditions cause an ear to come on the scene? Or a tongue? We’ve never seen completely new information evolve from any organism like that. If you have, please refer it to me. Nobody has yet to create a model of conditions that would cause natural selection to input a new trait completely foreign to its parent into the offspring. Modified: yes. Variety: yes. New: no.

You say, “Well eye balls formed so that we could see things in order to survive.” Okay, so you’re going to personify nature now? “It knew we needed eyes to survive.” Now we’ve got a personal force that guides life along its way. How did nature know we would be better with eyes? Eyes are not a response to a dangerous stimulus. Nobody I know can come up with a rational stimusul that would spur on the evolution of an eyeball.

You want to know how bad my lust capacities are? I’m watching a TV show during lunch, an episode from Arrow, and Malcom Merlin is dueling Nysa Al Gul for leadership of the League of Assassins. Before they begin, Malcom says, “In the interest of good taste, we’ll forgo the removal of the shirts.” Guess what I’m thinking about? Nyssa Al Gul without a shirt on. The show ends and I go on to do my accounting homework online. I’m at my computer now, and guess what thought returns to me. Nyssa Al Gul without a shirt on. “No, God, deliver me from this thought; I don’t want to sin against You. Lust is a deceit.” I do my accounting study problems, take the quiz, take the test, and now, two hours later I’m brain dead. A thought returns to me again. “I’ve never seen Nyssa Al Gul without a shirt on. I kind of want to.” “I wonder what would happen if I just google her name.” I google her name, and nothing explicit comes up. I google the actress’s name. “I wonder what would happen if I tag on ‘sex scene.’ It’s not really crossing the line, most sex scenes censor it so there’s nothing explicit. Who knows if she’s even been in one?” I google it. I go to videos. I click on one. “Oh look, there’s ten other women with masks on completely nude.” She’s chosen to have sex with another character in the clip, *and I watch*. It’s intimate and special. They make real conversation, she’s lying on him. Guess what just happened? I was enticed and carried away by my own lustful desires that were stimulated by a TV show I watched *3 hours ago* that had no nudity in it whatsoever. That’s how bad my lust capacities are. If yours are as bad as mine, this post you’re reading right now may easily be a trigger just like the show I watched. I imagine the words that pop out at you most are _nudity_, _shirtless_, and _sex_. You immediately have a visual connected to these words, like when I say _stop sign_. What am I going to do, you may ask, to make sure that those words don’t remain in your mind after you forget the point of this post? Well, there’s nothing like thoughts of death to kill your sex drive. Read “Death Be Not Proud.” This poem is like a cold shower. So is Ecclesiastes. Our main goal is to reduce certain chemicals in your system. Be aware, your sex drive is purely animalistic.

There’s a difference between beyond closed about your life and being locked. I sit down with somebody and I’m not going to spew out everything that’s happening with me. It’s just not how in wired. That’s not what’s on my brain. I’m more interested in talking about theology and science and philosophy and medical research, and I’m just as happy saying nothing at all. So when I’m sitting quietly in a room with you, and you think I’m closed just because I’m not automatically telling you what’s going on in my life, sure, maybe in closed, but the door is open. Ask me anything you like. I’m closed, not locked. My life events aren’t brimming out of me. I don’t need to vent my crap to you.

We’re supposed to honor the marriage bed. Honor means to elevate. We’re supposed to elevate sex. We are. One of the ways we honor the marriage bed is by recognizing it is the exclusive place for sex. Otherwise how is the marriage bed any better than casual sex with a harlot? … Now hold on Paul, doesn’t it make more sense to just have sex with different women whenever you get an itch and then just go straight back to the mission field? Then you don’t need to look after a family and you have more time to being the gospel to those who are perishing. What do you mean get married if we can’t control our sex drive? That doesn’t follow, Paul. Unless there is something intrinsically wrong with sleeping around with women you’re nor married to. … Marriage is not a covenant between two people, it’s a relationship between two people. When you get married, you don’t run around town with a piece of paper shouting out, “I’m married! I’m married! See, this paper says so.” No, you run around with your wife. You post photos on Facebook, you do things together, you share a life together. You become a union of one flesh.

There’s always going to be somebody more compatible with you than the person you marry. There’s what, 300 million people in America, and 7 billion people on the globe. You probably know a couple thousand at best. The reason you get married is not because the person you marry is the perfect fit, it’s because you’re not patient enough to find the closest fit. You’d have to search through 7 billion people. You’d be long dead before you find the right one, and even if you did manage to cross paths, you wouldn’t know it. You’d have to spend a lifetime with each person to deduce who’s the best match, and by that time you’ll already be caught up into heaven having wasting your life searching for the right person to marry. Don’t do that. Find a partner, get married, live for eternity, and die. Don’t spend your life looking around for the perfect match. You’re not making a covenant that lasts forever, just until death parts you. That’s only 60 years. It’s a flash in time. Don’t let charry-picking pressure you. That’s a burden nobody could carry, and it’s the wrong burden to carry in the first place. Pick up your cross and live for God.

And not only that, people change over time. Think of the Pocahontas Disney movies. Whoever was the right person for you twenty years ago may not be the perfect person for you twenty years later. If compatibility was the issue in marriage God wouldn’t have ordained it to be a life-long covenant. You would just go through partners like houses and cars. Find someone good until you find someone better. That’s not how marriage was designed. Or like clothes. Twenty years ago size 30 pants were your fit. Now it’s size 34. It doesn’t stay the same, it changes and you have to commit to whatever fits you. ? No. That’s not how it works in marriage.

James was not writing to Gentile Christians, he was writing to Jewish Christians. You say there is no difference? Galatians 2, there’s a difference. James says that it’s the word implanted, which is the law of liberty, which is the Law of Moses, that saves your soul. Paul said it’s by grace through faith that you have been saed, and this is not of yourselves (your works), it is the gift of God that no man may boast(…_who predestined you for works_.) James said you are justified by works, not faith alone. Paul said we maintain that a man is justified by faith alone apart from works. Don’t perform some rhetorical acrobatics to twist the scriptures and make them align. They say different things here. I am a student of Paul (being a Gentile), and Paul rebuked Peter in Galatians 2 for withdrawing from the Gentile uncleanness after the party of James had arrived. Paul said to Peter that he was not in step with the gospel that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ. Paul told Peter he was out of step with the gospel for refusing to eat unclean food. You know why he refused to eat the food? The text tells us why: he feared the party of James. It was James’ legalistic, squeaky-clean doctrine that produced hypocrisy in Peter. The doctrine of James caused Peter to walk out of step with the gospel. And we look at his writings as inherent? Inspired? The Bible never says that! It never makes the claim that the apostles’ words are infallible. We know they were not by Galatians 2! Paul’s words were inspired. Jesus appeared to him to make him His chosen instrument. That Bible says that. It says nothing about James’ credibility. It was 67 scholars that put James’ book in our canon. They almost left out Jude because it quoted Enoch. And we think this collection of books is inarguable? The bible doesn’t include the criteria the council used to create the canon. They had to have seen Jesus…that doesn’t mean they were infallible! They were fallible! James asserts twice in chapter five that they were in the last days and the coming of the Lord was near. . . . Well he was wrong about that. Even so, he himself admits that the Spirit in him is the same spirit in all of us who are chosen by God and called to be saints. Elijah was a man with a nature like ours. There isn’t anything special about having an apostolic Holy Spirit, it’s the same Holy Spirit in us. In fact, there’s really nothing special about the apostles at all. During their time with Jesus, which is what sets them apart from the rest of us, they were nothing special. They never got crazy for Jesus until after He had already gone away, after Pentecost. There is nothing more infallible with them than there is with us, except by the Word of Christ which appointed Paul as a chosen instrument. …1 Tim 3:16 …I’m sorry, did you see the word inherent in there? Maybe we could just read it again, I kind of missed it. Where are you getting that from? How are you getting inherent from useful? Where did the doctrine of inerrancy come from? Did the early church fathers believe the Bible is inerrant?

The notion that the bible is infallible is a notion concocted by the Catholic Church to maintain control over the people in the middle ages. You can’t question the authenticity of this book! Yes, you can, and you should. Jesus rose from the dead: I’ll construe Him as infallible. Paul was Jesus chosen instrument: I’ll construe him

I’m really not a feminist. Let me explain where I’m coming from. I think it’s racist to deny the difference between white and black men. I haven’t met a black man yet who was offended at being called a black man. If you say, “Don’t call him a black man!” That’s assuming there’s something derogatory or wrong with being black, and I don’t think there is, so I’ll acknowledge the differences in our skin color. The same applies to gender. There are differences between men and woman that would be sexist to deny. Woman have estrogen, men don’t. Men have 20 times the testosterone woman have. Man have vasopressin, women have oxytocin. Men have on average 30% more muscle mass than women. These are not bad differences, they are necessary differences. It is a man’s job to represent the fierce, brute, powerful side of God’s image, and it is the woman’s job to represent the meek, lamblike qualities of God. To try and equalize them are to say, “Let’s just fold the image of God in half. Who needs both sides?” It is sexist to deny the differences between men and women. Both have positions and roles to play in a family, in society, and in declaring the nature of our God, and both are necessary. Don’t water that down.

## 2016 Presidential Election                                            

You say, “What would you do with post-office presidential income?” It would go to the fatherless. The orphans. The widows. The people who’s biggest dream it is to go a day without being hungry. Bear the weight of this America: the reason people go hungry in this world is not because the amount of food in the world, but because the filthy, unequivocally rich people like us care more about green paper than the needs of other people. I am unapologetically outraged at this. Every human being on this planet should have access to clean water and enough food to keep them healthy. This is the lowest level on Maslow’s Hierarchy, it should be a human right. And we give 70% of our grain to cows so we can keep eating hamburgers. This madness needs to stop! This obliviousness needs to end! This blindness needs the hand of Jesus to open our eyes and see that we can stop world hunger today. There is more than enough food. There is enough grain on the planet to feed every human being 2 pounds per day.

The reason I don’t think I would make you happy as a leader is because my concerns and efforts are toward people, not just Americans. I care about the people in China as much as I care about Americans. I care about the people in Mexico as much as I care about Americans. I care about the hungry children in Uganda, the fatherless orphans Nigeria, the young girls who have been sex trafficked in India. My focus and empathy is for every person on this earth. I think the unalienable rights our country is founded on is a truth present in every human being on this planet not just the people who step on this soil with a piece of paper in their hand saying they belong here.

What makes fire? Is it really how air? A gas? It’s as if it comes from another dimension, fluctuating in and out of existence like energy in the quantum vacuum. Thermal energy is being taken from an object and turns into fire. But what is fire? What is a weight of fire? It’s density? What elements make it up?

There is a direct relationship between your experience with the gospel and how you get along with somebody else. When you realize the depth of your sin, the lowness of your integrity, that you deserve hell but have been forgiven by God, you won’t be offended by any offense. You can no longer play the game that some people are better than others. Your all sinners saved by grace deserving hell, so what’s the big deal about her feet by your head? Lay it aside in your heart. Put yourself beneath her. Pretend you are a lowly servant in medieval times and she is a wealthy master.

I think all of us at some point understand intuitively that law is placed under the arch of reason. My oldest sister hopped in the car one day while we are on vacation in Missouri, an judge of the law if there ever was one, and we were only crossing the street so she just lied down across the middle and side seat holding on to some stuff. When I rebuked her, she laughed and said she couldn’t get to the back (it would’ve been a hassle), and when I came up with a crashing scenario she said, “than it would be very much my own fault.” What you have to understand though, is that she is treating the law as something that is subject to reason, which I agree with, but I think she would hesitate to say it in so many words. So now whenever you’re going to rebuke someone, you can’t just say “it’s against the law.” That isn’t enough anymore. Once you have placed the law underneath reason, that’s for everybody. It is no longer sovereign, you have to appeal to something higher.

I’m concerned about the arrogance of my sister. She just asserts she is correct and doesn’t feel the need to give any reason. What kind of authority do you think your words carry? Dad: “this water taste worse than the tap water to me” Anna: no. Caleb: “according to the site sonic in Wyllie opens up at 10. Anna: that’s not correct.

Namaan would have done something hard to be saved, but something so easy seemed like foolishness to him, when all Elisha said was,  be dunked in water. All Jesus asks us to do is be baptized. You say,  what is baptism?  It’s an appeal to God for a good conscience.

I’m very skeptical of people whose ego claims Devine understanding of the Bible. Pastor Anderson is not a mature believer; he had not been humbled by God, he hasn’t been softened by God, and he is arrogant, asserting his doctrine is right and anyone who says something different is a blasphemous liar and false teacher. Slamming his hands against the table, his body language speaks clear volumes of infant Christian screams.

And so when a couple get a divorce people look at that and say, “yeah, that’s what God is offering me. If I screw up bad enough He’ll send me on my way. ‘I don’t like you anymore, depart from me you worker of iniquity.’” And that’s what a lot of people think about God in their subconscious, because that’s all they know, that’s all they’ve seen. And so they don’t have any concept of absolute love without condition, of “Yeah, you keep screwing up, you keep offending me and treating me awful, but I absolutely love you unconditionally and I’m not leaving.” Something I like to say is that it only takes one person in a marriage to make the bed. And by that I mean you don’t need both members to compromise their hearts to make it work. That’s ideal, but all you need to work through it is one person to be offended and not offend in return. All you need is one person to say, “I know half these dishes are hers, but I’ll wash them all anyway. I know I just had a hard day at work and she is yelling at me because I haven’t done so and so, but God had softened me and I do deserve to be reviled by Him for offending His infinite dignity, and if He hasn’t reviled me for that, but taken my offense on His own shoulder, I can take revilement from my wife against my dignify (that deserves far worse in the first place) on myself. Yeah, maybe she often overreacts, and treats be badly, and reviles me for things that weren’t my fault, and maybe I don’t deserve that, but I deserve a lot worse from a Holy God who forgave me, so yeah, anything she does to me, I’m going to say ‘I deserve worse.’” When people see that, they’ll have something to look to when they hear about the grace and mercy of God.

“If any man thinks ill of you, do not be angry with him; for you are worse than he thinks you to be.” ~ Spurgeon

From where I’m standing, I can’t imagine anything so bad between you two that you can’t work through it.  Isn’t they’re something in both of your souls that whispers,  “it’s not too late?” I’m sorry I said I wouldn’t say anything.

Man, what did you vow to her? When you make your words empty your done talking.  You say people change in twenty years, well then why have you lost hope?

Your greatest offence isn’t against each other, it’s to God. You made a promise on His name, in holy matrimony.  

How stupid do you think purple were back then? Like they didn’t have a word for bull shit?

We’ve disneyfied the Bible in this age. We’ve said it’s either all inerrant or is all a lie. Really? That’s out of step with the bible, with Solomon when he says avoid all extremes, with Jeremiah when he asks, “how can you say we have the law when the lying hands of the scribes handle it?” with Paul when he rebuked Peter for subscribing to the apostle James’ doctrine, with God when he asks Job,  “who is this who darkens council?” I’m convinced this sprang from a church obsessed with power and said,  “you can’t question us! If you question what I say about doctrine you question the bible and God!”

There’s a difference between being humble before the Lord and being insecure because you’re not before the Lord.

Psychology is not based on empirical observation, it’s based on qualitative tendencies. Any field of study absent of reoccurring laws is not science.

Adultery is a much bigger deal than the sting your partner might feel because you cheated of him or her.

When men depart and say goodbye, it’s common enough to stretch out your arm to the side slowly enough for the other guy to catch on and you’ll swing over to a handshake sendoff. But when I do that to a woman they think I’m going for a hug, and so instead of imitating me they’ll come in for an embrace. At that point I have two choices. I can freak out and say, “No, handshake! Handshake!” and there will be this awkward deal for her and me, awkward for her because she misread that I was doing, and awkward for me because she misread what I was doing and I bailed. It’s a whole lot easier if you just go for the hug.

Very few people I know who have a really good handle on the Bible just woke up one morning and decided, “You know what? Life is pretty great, I think I’ll just spend hours studying the Bible.” Most of the seekers I know seek because of a brokenness that sets in on the soul and cries out for something to help.

We were in Sunday school one day when our course material asked the question why, with the urgency of the gospel message and the promise that Christ will return with wrath, and in view of a world out there that is perishing, why we don’t go out and scatter the seed of the gospel, as it were. My immediate response was an experiential answer. One reason is because there is a shame in these kinds of confrontations. You know? You’re out there trying to respectfully defend the faith in gentleness, because Ephesians says it grieves the Holy Spirit when we use our words to unwholesomely without grace, so we’re not being hostile, or threatening them with hell, or tearing them down, but these atheists have no such rules. What inevitably happens is that the atheist comes to a point when he can’t refute us any longer, and so his only appeal left is a kind of lawyer’s trick where if you can’t attack the argument, you attack the person making the argument to try to invalidate what he says by attacking his character. And so when the atheist is logically defeated, almost every time they resort to personal debasements and insults. So there is this aspect of shame involved, but when they say things like, “You’re being dishonest. Isn’t there something in your religion about dishonesty?” That’s when you can say, “Yes, exactly right, that’s why I need grace. Let me tell you about Jesus.” There’s your way in. And every time I walk away praising God that I was counted worthy to suffer shame for the sake of the gospel. It’s so worth it. Another reason I think why we don’t do this is, and I’m sure you’ve heard this before, “I don’t know enough.” We look at the atheists and they seem so intellectual and we think, “Well I won’t be able to answer them, and if anything I might just make them more hardened to Christianity and ruin the chances of somebody else who might come along later to witness to them, so I better just leave it to the smart people.” But the truth is, in my experience, after studying all the arguments and science of it, I’m constantly having to stop myself from destroying these atheists and making them look like fools. Because when I first started out in apologetics, I was ready to take on people like Dawkins, and when I found was very few people in Texas were willing to disagree with me in the first place. Everybody here thinks evolution is stupid. And at the off chance that I did find an atheist willing to debate me, I made them look absolutely stupid. And when you make it an argument to be won, learn from my experience, it’s no longer an invitation to come to Jesus. And so the knowledge I acquired really became a handicap for me because it was too tempting to be domineering, and when you make it an argument, they never change their minds, and so now I constantly am having to lay aside everything I learned to let the Lord speak through me. Keep studying and all that, but don’t wait, because the emptier your mind is the your words, the more room there is to be filled with God’s words. An argument doesn’t persuade atheists, but an invitation will make them listen. Another reason is that the gospel message is an offensive word. We live in a relativistic culture where nobody wants to say anything bad about anybody else, and if you do you’re an intolerant bigot. It’s offensive to approach people with a message that says they are perishing because of their sin. “Oh by the way, you’re an abomination.” We want to get along with people, and without the Law to show them their sin nobody will come to Christ. As it says in Romans, “The end of the law is Christ for righteousness,” and in Galatians, “The law is a tutor that brings us to Christ.”

Christians, understand that the world will hate us, but not because we’ve done something to warrant their hate. The famous 1 Peter 3:15 verse says to offer your arguments in gentleness, not hostility, so that nobody will have any grounds for saying anything bad against you. Understand, friends, that it grieves God’s spirit when we ignore that command. In Ephesians it says don’t let any unwholesome word proceed from you lips except that which is useful for edification according to the need of the moment, that it will give grace to those who hear. Grace to those who hear. Not threats of hell, not personal debasements, but grace. We haven’t been sent out to scare people into Jesus, understand that in Romans it says it’s the kindness of God that leads men to repentance. His kindness. I wish we’d all remember that when we’re out on the field.

Don’t get me wrong, I love doing the dishes. It’s a really great time to memorize scripture if nobody is around, or if it’s loud I can put in some ear buds and listen to a sermon. But on nights when I’m tired and I walk in the door, and I look across the kitchen and the dishes have already been done, I am so thankful. It was as if the gates of heaven had opened and said, “Ethan, my son, this is your gift. Proceed now to your slumber.” “Thank you God! Thank you!” I mean it’s just a really great experience. That and that somebody has carried your burden on themselves.

It isn’t “waiting until,” it’s “waiting for.” #staychaste

God cannot be logically impossible. The Physical of our universe don’t apply to Him, but logic isn’t ontologically continent on our universe. It’s like abstract objects such as numbers; did God create numbers? If He is a triune God from eternity past, than numbers exist necessarily, not contingently, and the same with logic. It’s not like when we get out of here there will be different rules of logic and philosophy, those things are ontologically necessary. Therefore God cannot have knowledge of our future choices and our choices really be ours. It’s logically incompatible. Arminianism is a joke, and it waters down God to a magically arbtrary being who is whatever I think him to be without any reprucusions. No, there is a reality to God. And all throughout the gospels it is written, Jesus did this so that the prophesy would be fulfilled. It wasn’t that God looked into the future and saw what Jesus would do and prophesied it, he promised it. Prophesies are promises from an omnipotent God, not fortune telling of an omniscient God. This is my conviction. God hardened pharoes heart, and sometimes intervenes in our free will to fulfil prophesy or some other purpose toward His glory.

2 Kings 19:7

I’m not your judge, and you can thank God for that because I would make a terrible judge. But it would be a mistake not to fear that too because God will be a terrifying judge.

You can’t bring yourself to vote for Hillary or trump? God chose. We think our little democracy males it so our leaders are elected, and that power belongs to the people. No, no, no,  our president is appointed by God and power is always His. Figure out His will against your opinion and vote.

When we’re talking about the origin of the universe, science is basically useless. All science can do is measure how the universe works. But since the universe can’t cause itself, it must have been caused by something outside the constraints of our universe, and therefore it is a metaphysical appeal. Science is only useful in showing us that such an appeal is necessary by virtue of an increasing thermodynamic disorder in the universe, such that if the universe was infinite in the past we would have run out of energy by now. Practically, however, science can do nothing to show how the universe might’ve been caused.

Against you only … you don’t owe me anything, I’m a wicked vile simmer. Privilege vs right. From God, to God. Don’t like messing up, went to help out, broke a morror. My purpose for being there, my value brakes with the glass.

There’s this little matter of sexual immorality that God does not dig, and I find that when I follow his way, and have His words in me, my joy is made fuller than with anything else.

Dear Bethany, I beat you! ;) The Lord has finally counted me worthy to ascend into His sancuary. I can only imagine the glories that await us when we are caught up into His Kingdom at the ressurection. Do not weep when I am gone. The Lord gives and takes away, blessed be His name. This day death will part us, and you will be unbound from the union of flesh. Don’t get too excited, we’ll still share a spiritual oneness that transcends the oneness of the flesh in every way! Seek the Lord’s will in all that you do. I have prayed to the Lord that He might send you another man to comfort you, and to share this life with you. Go find someone else to share this life with. I’m sorry it couldn’t be me. What stings the most about death is losing you, but I know God is good in all that He does. I have so much more to say, but my hands grow weary from writing.  At least I got to say more than you did ;). I love you with all my heart. Grace be with you, always.  Ethan.

I get it, she’s playing the jealousy card, she wants me to fight for her. But that’s selfish, she wasn’t thinking about me, she just wanted to be honored by being fought for, without considering what it might make her partner feel. I don’t want to be with a person like that. What are men? Just brute animals that say, I want something, therefore I get something? The jealousy card operates on the premise that guys think in terms of what they want without considering what their partner wants, and that’s just not true. If you prefer somebody else, maybe he’ll step back and say, “I don’t want to waste my time.”

I had a girl tell me one time, “Guys don’t get insecure,” (when we were talking about her boyfriend), I said, “Is he a Christian?” She said, “Yeah. What does that have to do with anything?” I said, “A person who is saved is by definition someone who has said to God, ‘I can’t do it on my own, I need Christ. I want to be saved not because of what I do but because of what He did.’ The problem with the people in Matthew 7:21 to whom Jesus says, ‘Depart from me you workers of iniquity,’ is that they were secure in themselves. Do you remember their response to Jesus? ‘But look at our works! We cast demons out in your name.’ They thought they would commend themselves to God. Their problem is that they weren’t insecure. So don’t tell me guys inevitably find their security in themselves. If that’s true, no male is saved.” Don’t make the mistake of misplacing your security in yourself.

Do not think that her trap means she is attributing value to you. A hunter who lays a berma-ease tiger trap is not honoring the tiger. He us saying to the tiger, “you are not valuable to me alive. You are only valuable to me dead.” In the same way she is saying to you,  “you ate not valuable to me as a godly person. You are only valuable to me is a godless person.”which is the equivalent of spiritual death comma Adesa Adidas a deadness of much greater magnitude than that of the body. Then take you through some Bible verses because my device my advice won’t Empower you it’s the Holy Spirit who will Empower you so you need to listen to what he says in his word logical reasons don’t want to speak to the situation because temptation is a heart things not allowed to say not a mind thing do you need to rely on the Holy Spirit to change your heart

Dating methods are so laughable geologists in that respect are nothing more than forensic speculographist.

I used to be a very suspicious person. Whether it was somebody complementing me, and I would question their motives, or someone telling a story, and I would be skeptical of its validity, until I read in 1 Corinthians 13 that love believes all things. And I realized that it’s unloving to be suspicious of people. Jesus said, “You will be known by your love,” not your doctrine, not your music, but your love. So yes, I believed this man, because it’s the loving thing to do; it’s the Christian thing to do.

Perhaps the reason eyes decline with age is to testify about something. Maybe that as we get older we become set in our ways and our eyes become blurred. We don’t see things for what they are anymore, we see them with our prejudgments. When a professor walks in the room you make initial judgements: White, male, hick accent, and you begin to match him to your past experience with people of those characteristics. Whether you like it or not. It’s called profiling.

People keep being like, “You don’t understand. You need to save for retirement. The way you use your money will determine the next forty years of your life.” I’m like, “No you don’t understand, there are people out there whose biggest concern is their next meal. The way I spend my money shows me where my treasure is. Is it in God or in this illusion of security? It’s a false security anyway if my security is in this perishable paper. Like really? Let’s get real. God owns the world. If he gives it to me, that’s secondary. But my treasure is above.”

Is that question springing from estrogen or serotonin? Is estrogen asking that question or is it serotonin? Estrogen is the sex hormone, it means you’re just lagitamitely horny and want to bang. Seritonin is the mood hormone. It makes you want to be accepted, or be valuable to someone.

The most efficient thing is not always the most convenient thing (busses).

If you got rid of it I’d be enraged but I wouldn’t live any less a life because of it.

If you’re attracted to some guy, it’s just your body’s way of tricking you into reproducing. Everything in nature is set up to make more of itself. Even at the expense of dying. Isn’t that interesting?

…Because we can’t have a conversation if you’re not going to be honest with me, and you can’t be honest with me if you’re not honest with yourself. Don’t you find it interesting that you make “artful” pictures of naked women but not naked flamingos? The reason for that isn’t art, it’s sexuality. When you see a naked women, chemicals happen. I don’t care who you are, that’s psychology, that’s neuroscience. Your body gets dosed with dopamine, Oxytocin for women, vasopressin for men, serotonin, testosterone, estrogen if you’re a women. The reason you can enjoy the “art” of nudity is because of those chemicals. This doesn’t mean you’re going to get a boner. In fact, sexual novelty actually prevents that from happening because your body catches on and starts to regulate the amount of chemicals that’s released. It damages your chemical mechanisms to look at picture after picture after picture of naked people. But your amygdala still correlates those chemicals with naked women, so when you get the urge, and you especially will if your body is used to it, you will naturally go to nudity.

“That’s the way the culture was back then” isn’t an argument. Let’s be honest. “Well, in that culture murder was generally thought of as unacceptable.” Good for them. It was right in line with God’s word. But that doesn’t change with cultural change. If you think the truth of God hangs on cultural norms, you don’t really place any authority on the Bible at all. “I do not permit women to speak in Church.” That’s that. Now we’ve got people saying, “It’s perfectly fine for women to be pastors.” How did we fall this far from the ministry of Paul?

I am so thankful for James and Hebrews and John. In my generation, we learn the gospel before we learn the law. We learn that Jesus saves us from sin before we learn a chance to feel the hopelessness of trying to get out of sin on our own. But in Bible before you ever see Jesus preaching the gospel, you find him making sure these people know the law. The rich young ruler came to him, and Jesus threw the law at him. Why? Because it’s the law that brings people to Christ. It’s in the sheer hopelessness of trying to do it yourself that we find the gospel so attractive, and we come to Christ. If you have never experienced that kind of hopelessness, that kind of effort, your ultimate and complete affection will never be for God. So I am very thankful for the apostles who give people like me a passage to make people feel hopeless. Because I see a lot of Christians who are casual for God, or passionate for a superficial, surface level understanding of God (as Paul says, a zeal not in accordance with knowledge about God). But they all believe the Bible, so this is a doorway to get them where they need to be.

It’s easy to love God when other people are around. What about when you’re alone? Is your relationship with God really your relationship with God? Or when you’re alone, do you turn to sin? Because so many people can look like they are passionate, but when they close that door they bring up pornography on their phone or laptop. If your relationship with God is really yours, it wouldn’t be that way.

Don’t get stuck on the music, and the graphics, and the cool looking media, the cool designs, and the manipulative isochronic tones they play during prayers, and all these things that you depend on to experience the Holy Spirit. Because friends, using these stimuli to trigger an experience with God is like a man in bed with his wife who needs to look at porn to keep an erection. It’s idolatrous. Those things are empty. They’ll disappear. If you wire yourself to love God in those things you’ll lose affection for the actual God who isn’t in those thigns. The graphics can distract from the truth the words are trying to get across.

## Anger

“God is a righteous judge, And a God who has indignation every day.” ~ Psalm 7:11 are you really going to say to God, “No, no! Hate the sin, not the sinner!” and correct Him as _His_ counselor? “Do I not hate those who hate You, O Lord? And do I not loathe those who rise up against You? I hate them with the utmost hatred; They have become my enemies.” ~ Psalm 139:21 There is a difference between hating a personal enemy, and hating the Lord’s enemy. “Should you help the wicked and love those who hate the Lord and so bring wrath on yourself from the Lord?” ~ 2 Chronicles 19:2 “Be angry, and yet do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, and do not give the devil an opportunity.” ~ Ephesians 4:26-27 “Then the Spirit of God came upon Saul mightily when he heard these words, and he became very angry.” ~ 1 Samuel 11:6

Don’t let me teach. I don’t want to teach kids not to believe the Bible. But I don’t. And here’s why: Paul said to James, “You minister to Jews, I’ll minister to Gentiles.” So Paul and Peter are eating with the gentiles, unclean and gloriously justified. Then the party of James comes along, and Peter withdraws from them. You say why did Peter withdraw from the gentiles? He’s stepping back and saying, “I don’t do that. I don’t eat unclean food,” because he’s being influenced by James’ mere presence. And Paul rebukes him to his face and says the gospel is at stake Peter! You’re walking out of step with the gospel. So if Paul rebukes Peter just for being influenced by James, why do we think James’s book is a good candidate to include in our canon? God didn’t say to do that, 67 scholars 200 years after Christ did. And somewhat arbitrarily to. They came up with their own criteria that you don’t find anywhere in the Bible. I get it, scripture is God-breathed, pnuema. But guess what? So are we. Are we perfect? It doesn’t follow. And quite aside from that, the New Testament was not a part of Christian scripture until 200 years after Christ, so Paul couldn’t have possibly been tralking about himself and his cronies.

“‘Stole’ is such a harsh word. They would have donated those goods readily if they were compassionate. I consider it a tax on the greedy.” ~ Jolee Bindo

You’d make a lousy psychologist. I’m not confidant. Do you know why I’ve never asked a girl out ever in my life? I always say, “It’s because of 1 Corinthians 7.” But the truth is it’s because I’m a very insecure person. Why would anybody want me? I can’t give you anything. People say, “None of that matters, you marry for love.” Well if love is a feeling, those feelings can be duplicated. It’s pheromones and oxytocin; they’re very generic feelings there’s nothing special about any one person you feel that way about. If it’s a choice than you can choose anybody because love in that sense in unconditional. So really the only underlying basis for marriage that’s left is advantage. You marry for advantage, you marry because they can provide for you, because they have money, because they can give you something. But me? I’ve got nothing for anybody. If I did I’d give it to orphans and widows, and then there’d still be no reason to marry me. Don’t think that because I’m cocky, quick, and think I’m always right that I’m confidant.

I’m objective, and I appeal to reason, I have an open mind, but not so open that my brains fall out.

I think it’s time for some Bible verses. Lay aside the old self which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit, and be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and put on the new self which in the likeness of God is being created in righteousness and holiness of the truth. You forgot to die to yourself this morning, friend. What did Paul say? I die every day. As soon as you wake up you’ve got to put that old self to death, you’ve got to lay that carnal self aside, and every moment of the day because oh that carnal man will creep back in if you let him. Why do you think I didn’t watch dead pool? “Oh because I’m just too righteous to watch a movie like that”? No, it’s because my lust capacities are terrible. If I saw the nudity in that movie there’s no telling where that goes in my head. Once that seed is planted, once that domino falls, it’s a vicious cycle that’s hard to get out of. Opening myself to the smallest bit of corruption is selling myself to the same old master, and I don’t want to be a slave to him any longer.

Every fourth Sunday or so, I now submit to stay at home in solitude and pray. There is just nothing as refreshing and as restoring to my faith and walk as this time I spend at home without anybody here. I can clean and stop and remember the purposes of God.

One day these people are going to stand before God, a holy Judge, and they will have to give an account for why they chose to live a lifestyle that God has said is an abomination to Himself, so I will not do anything, _anything_ to encourage they’re everlasting death and torment. That’s hateful, that’s unloving, and I will have nothing to do with it. I care about gays. I have a very good friend who is gay and I pray for him every day. I don’t have to tack on, “This is just what I believe.” By virtue of me saying it, it’s obvious that’s what I believe.

## Carnal Christian Or Sinless Son?

You’d think that after all God was doing in and for Isreal during their exodus from Egypt that they would understand for sure that God was with them. He performed 10 signs in Egypt, nothing short of devine miracles. He was leading them by fire in the night and in a cloud during the day. He opened the red sea for them to pass on dry land. And yet in chapter 17, they were thirsty and began grumbling against Moses because they had no water. And in verse 7 it says they named the place “Test” and “Quarrel” because they tested the Lord saying, “Is the Lord really among us, or not?” When I read that it struck me that I do the very same thing all the time. I look at Todd White and the apostles and all the miracles they perform and the power of the Holy Spirit, and I look at myself, ordinary, normal, nothing special emanating from me, and I go, “Is the Holy Spirit really in me, or not?” But it’s not our place to test God, it’s our place to stand on the promises of God, that He has given us the promised Holy Spirit as the seal of our salvation, as the earnest of our inheritance, and He yearns jealously for the Spirit that He has made to dwell in us. It’s not about the power, like Simon in Acts chapter 8 who tried to buy the gift of God with his silver. He wanted the power and Peter rebuked him very harshly for it. What we do know is that God’s covenant has already been vindicated with signs and wonders, and we have only to believe.

Huh

Haha maybe that was a little too metaphorical. What I’m saying is that without having Jesus’ words abiding in us, there’s no real way to know Him truly and fully. There’s a lot of ideas and concepts and feelings about who Christ is, but the only way to experience the Holy Spirit is through the words He is speaking through the pages of the Bible. You said your relationship with Christ is good, but that you aren’t in His word. I’m not being mean, but don’t you understand that’s a contradiction? Snap chat has limited word count lol. Do you have sms or another texting app?

## Carnal Christian Or Sinless Son?

Maybe I like seasons of doubt and despair because it admits something is wrong and that leaves room for hope that there’s something better. Without doubting I’m a Christian, I inevitably see myself as someone incapable of enjoying God, and that is sick beyond measure. I want 1 John 3:6 and Matthew 7:21 to be talking about me, because that means maybe I can be saved, and salvation will free me from sin. This is a dark place to be.

Satan doesn’t cause me very much affliction in life. He’s tried that already, and I praised God for it so quickly and loudly that it went away in a moments time. Satan strategy with me isn’t affliction, because God gets glorified when I lean on Him and praise Him for my suffering. Because suffering is promised in the Bible so I get really nervous if I don’t suffer. But the way Satan works with me, is he gives me stuff. It’s awful. I have so much in this life it takes me away from my relationship with Christ. If you don’t want suffering, praise God for it. “God thank you for this suffering. You promise there will be suffering for those who are in Christ, thank you for showing me who I am. Thank you for uniting me with Christ in His suffering. It’s such an honor Lord. Thank you for chastising me with your rod and your staff, without it I’d be so lost. You are a merciful God, abounding in lovekindness and infinite in goodness. Thank you for these trials, God, because the testing of our faith produces endurance and perseverance. You’re so good to us.” I was almost disappointed when my suffering was taken away after an experience like that, until I began to praise God for relieving me. Satan loses either way. It’s a glorious framework.

Thank you for these trials because they purify my faith. My faith needs to be purified. Thank you for purifying my faith Lord Jesus. Burn away all the impurities.

## Carnal Christian Or Sinless Son?

Most of you probably think you’re going to heaven. Because that’s what the Bible says, the people to whom Jesus says, “I never knew you,” are the same people who say, “Yes you do; you know me.” In fact, you’re probably so certain about your salvation that what I’m saying doesn’t even phase you. You’re just sitting there in your security, “I’m a Christian. I’m saved.” The Bible says that’s the anthem of the many who come to Christ and call Him Lord but in reality their whole life was based on a delusion. Because man, that wide gate, that paradigm that says, “I’ve been going to Church, reading my Bible, and serving God for forty years,” is a well-crafted lie; it looks just like the real thing. All of these institutions, these gatherings of brothers so-called, are so normal that we don’t even think to question, “Is God really behind this?” If your church is normal, then it’s probably going to hell. Because Jesus said it’s the many who don’t know him, and only a few will enter in to His glory. Everybody thinks they know Him. “Yeah, I know Jesus. Northlake is a special church.” Really? Is that why we look so much like the early church? Expansive? Performing miracles? Preaching the word as we’re going? Living like our gospel message is the most urgent thing in the world? I’ve been to a lot of churches and every one of them thinks they’re special. Every one. But I read the Bible, and I go, “Man _that_ church was special. These building though? Filled with attenders? People who do church 2 or 3 times a week? I don’t see anything special.” I’ve gone to church every week for 20 years, and I can tell you all I’ve experienced is a social gathering. We talk about God in the classroom when the teacher is asking questions, but on our own we don’t encourage one another in the Lord. We talk about life, current news, what’s going on, blah, blah, blah, but in the end it’s just a bunch of small talk. And God-forbid you come down and depressed. They will look at you like you don’t belong here. It’s what I’ve experienced in my 20 years of doing this.

“Are you a Christian?” “I believe that about 2000 years ago, a man was born of a virgin, lived a perfect life, was killed, and rose again in three days. Now it’s recorded that a spear was plunged into His side and a mix of blood and water flowed out, so He was really dead. And if He could rise from the dead, I’m inclined to believe that what this man said was true, about being the Son of God. I think He was.”

At the end of the day, even if this is a delusion, I don’t want to wake up, because I remember what life was like without it, and it was miserable, and if this life is all I have, I want it to be filled with as much joy as I can fill it with. And this delusion, as you say it is, keeps me smiling in the midst of total loss and tradgedy.

It is such a futile discussion to say James wasn’t saying were saved by works but that if we’re saved then we will work, because it has the same implication about me. That’s what I’m  really asking. Am I saved? It’s so silly. Don’t argue doctrine, descern by the spirit.

You need the holy spirit to conquer sin. You say but I already have the holy spirit. That’s like saying I already have a car. You’ve got to get in the car and drive it to get anywhere. Why do you think rhe scriptures say to be filled with the spirit as a man is filled with wine? You’ve got to be in Him. Pray without ceasing throughout the day.

Praise God for this adversity that happened to me. Don’t ask him to change it just praise him.  It drives Satan crazy.  Haha. Silly Satan none of that matters to me

Good wants to give you the desires of your heart, but first he wants to be in your heart.

Some deep part of me has always wanted to walk with the Lord to make someone proud. I knew I was never going to meet Francis Chan, but I wanted to make him proud. Finally I ran into Todd White, and all I wanted was Jesus, and the reason is because he doesn’t preach condemnation, He preached good news. He already looks at you with value, he already thinks you’re worth something. I love John Piper, I needed his ministry for a season, but I always wanted to make him proud. I’ve finally decided, I don’t want to be smart, I just want to be my Fathers Son. I want to be holy like my Dad. I’m not throwing stones anymore, I’m going to write in the sand. This gospel has never been about telling people how bad they are, it’s about showing them how valuable they are. Heaven went bankrupt to purchase you, how dare we think we’re worthless. Jesus gave himself over to death and hades to get the Holy Spirit inside you. It’s like your sweet 16 Lamborghini y’all, it’s time to put the keys in the ignition and drive it.

Eisogetical song interpresations. High pitched: WHAT DOES EISOGETICAL MEAN?? It means to read your own agenda into a text. So for example when my girlfriend (a pillow, or a teddy bear) texts me, do you want it tonight? Exogesis would say, now what does that pronoun link to? What is she trying to say? And I might go back to her previous text that had said something about tacos for dinner. Eisogesis would say, “well culturally that normally means getting under the sheets! Woohoo!” but in the end she was talking about dinner.

I’ll look terrible! Ahh but God doesn’t look at you like men do, he looks at the heart. That’s all you need to be concerned about.

Today might’ve been an awful day. Right now I could have been in despair, empty, on my knees with spiritual vomit stuck in my throat. Today was the last day of finals, and therefore I was at my computer getting tired and silently frustrated at some problems that were taking too long. And I found myself praying the whole time, “God I’m being tempted right now, don’t let me fall into sin. I don’t want to go there anymore. In Jesus name let this temptation pass.” I didn’t know what was going on. I would be good for awhile longer, and then I would feel like going on the Internet and pleasing my eyes with beautiful women. My eyes were hungry and I couldn’t figure out why. I finally figured it out, it was because my body had grown used to looking at porn as an escape from frustration. I was being frustrated, so my body knew what to do. I kept relieving myself by retreated to my bed lest I completely wore my prefrontal lobes out and lost all control and rational guards. Do that if you get so frustrated that you’re tempted to sin. When I was resting I had a thought. If I had sinned, I would be even more frustrated right now, because that physics problem would still be there and now I would have a divine problem with it. But because I didn’t have a divine problem, I could thank God for his goodness and recognize that my physics problem isn’t a problem at all. Sin promises to recharge you, but it just leaves you with a mess. And you feel dirty. And you need to repent and wash yourself, but you don’t have time to do that because that’s the whole reason you went to sin in the first place.

I’d love to tell you that you can find eternal life by being a basically good person, but if that were true, you might never find Jesus and then you’d be stuck in eternity without anything to satisfy your soul, and that would be worse than ceasing to exist altogether.

During my senior year, I had questions that nobody could answer. I read the Bible for myself for the first time and things didn’t match up with everything I knew and believed. Even which translation, which books should be in the bible. I did a lot of study and nearly became a king James onliest because of the manuscript it’s translated from. Then I ran into an elder at my church, and he had answers for me. He knew exponentially what I had studied, and he put me to rest. I found someone that I could trust to have answers, and he became something special to me. Eventually along the course of time, I heard him answer some things in his discipleship class out of step with what I saw in the Bible (Rom 7 pre-Christian Paul, Gen 1 young earth creationism) and it was like I lost the one person in the universe that I thought I could trust to have answers. Then I looked back at everything he ever told me and I questioned it. Is codex sinaticus really reliable just because Blanchard said it was? I put him on a pedestal of more than human, and nobody can stand on that. I guess I just needed a rock, and anchor, someone I could believe, and I stopped believing in him. With everyone else I had a filter in things they would say to me. I would analyze it, be a skeptic, basically nothing was good at face value. Blanchard was the exception to that filter. I could believe whatever he said because he proved himself to be someone with answers so long ago, someone I could trust. But eventually even he disappointed me. Don’t ever put someone in the position that only God can fill. Mentors can still be mentors when they say something you disagree with.

Adultery is legal. It shouldn’t be done, but it isn’t punishable by U.S. law. Homosexuality should be thought of in the same way. I don’t advocate a form of law that illegalizes homosexuality, but to recognize homosexual union under the instutuion of marriage is another thing. I want to be as understanding and sympathetic as I can, because I have some very good friends who are gay, and I respect them. But when a woman looks at another woman with sexual love, a twinkle in her eye, wishing to become one flesh with her, that is gross and I will not compromise. I’m not condemning love, I’m condemning distorted love.

Christians, people who say they love Jesus, are not earnest for Him. I find a lot of zealous Christians, but like the Jews is a zeal without knowledge, because in their intereactions with people they are sarcastic and flippant, and use course jesting to laugh with each other, and are full of unconsideration which is againsy what the Bible says. “If you’re good at something, never do it for free.” Someone quoted the villain in Batman to me when I told them some things I was doing for some people, but immediately in just like, “Freely I’ve received so freely I give.” Christians need to be students of the Bible. Learn it. Soak it in. Let Jesus’ words abide in you. Let it ooze out of the pores of your skin. I believe God is calling you to lay aside some things of your personality to be renewed in the Spirit of your mind so you can be confirmed to the image of His Son.

The other day in Sunday School I mentioned a project that I was doing for somebody for free, and someone in my class said, “If you’re good at something, don’t do it for free.” Ha-ha! He quoted the villain in batman to me! But that was his advice, when Jesus says, “Freely you’ve received, now freely give.” Come on! We need to be people of the Bible, not people of batman! (Excited, smiling, not angry exclamation mark) And all of these pop culture wisdom. “Anger leads to the dark side!” Did you know the Bible says, “Be angry, yet do not sin”? It says that! “Don’t let the sun go down on your anger, and don’t give the devil an opportunity,” but be angry. Angry about what? Anger about sin. Not about people. Not about, “Oh you offended me,” or “Hey you treated me unfairly.” That’s not our battle. When somebody behaves in a way that contradicts God’s good nature, that isn’t the God-exalting, human-loving way to behave, it’s because _they_ are broken. And we should be broken for them not broken by them. But the reason Justin quoted batman to me is because that’s what he is filled with. Right? You become what you behold, and today in America we get conformed to pop culture because that’s what we behold. He’s seen it, he’s heard it, he thought it was wise, he let it speak to him. This pop culture wisdom is abiding in him. Why do I say that? Because it came forth from him. He spewed out batman in reaction (which means naturally. Reactions are natural. Pro-actions are decided.) in reaction to what I was doing. Jesus said, “Abide in me and my words in you.” But we’ve let our kids be filled with media and TV and the wisdom of the world instead. We’ve let ourselves be filled with that. What I hate most in the church today, is that I can spend all week studying the Bible, getting into the Word, memorizing scripture, and when I step in the door and watch how people interact and the jokes we make and the way we talk, … and talk, and talk, and never go. … it’s like nobody has a clue … that they can live higher than this. Nobody knows the golden words of God. Wisdom in the Bible can literally translate to knowledge applied, but you don’t see much of that in the majority of Christians I meet. Because we’re filled with the wrong things, and that needs to change.

Paul said let there be no divisions among you. We say, “Oh but we have to think about demographics and who people will connect best with. . .” No demographics. We’re a body.

Never ever let your ministry forgot it’s end purpose. It’s not about the graphics, the cool music, or basically the quality of the seed you’re tossing out there, it’s about understanding the will of the Lord and doing what He’s asked of us. It’s never been about getting praise from men. “Woah that’s wicked sick!” “Bro, you have so many views!” “Man, you’re so godly.” All of that is empty. People can’t lift you up because they were meant to lift God up. If you’re getting praise, you’ve missed the point. Don’t become the object of somebody’s worship, lest you become an idol. Remember Hared in Acts 12. Why do we want praise from people anyway? But can you imagine our Father in Heaven, the God of the universe, creator of everything, who put all the stars in their place and because of the strength of His power none of their hosts is missing, Him saying to you, “Well done”? That’s so much better. People are broken. They say nasty things but they can’t … todd white … It’s not people who satisfy us, it’s or Father in Heaven. Walk with Him, do what He wants you to do, and nothing else matters. Ministry is always about God and about people. Don’t complicate it. Heal the sick. Feed the hungry. Care for the orphan and the widow. Talk to your Dad. Do what’s necessary and sit at the feet of Jesus and listen to His words and be filled with them so that they abide in you and you can then discern the will of God and actually do it because you have the word as your sword for the fight, and the strength of the Holy Spirit because Jesus’ words are life and Spirit, so if they’re in you you’ve got the Spirit in you and nothing can stop you. That’s ministry. Always be a people person. You say, “but I don’t get along with people,” be renewed in the Spirit of your mind.” you say how? Be getting His word in you. Study. Be studious to show yourself approved. Not to preach yourself approved. Spread the seed and reap a harvest for the Kingdom. There will come a day when we can no longer do this. Is urgant, people are dying every day who don’t know Jesus. And just as bad, people are living everywhere who don’t know Jesus. But they’re  dead because they don’t have life. When you see a dead person walking around you should want to give them live. They’re everywhere! If you don’t see them, get out of the house. Sing to God and jave relationship with Him. Don’t just assume that it’s impossible to live life 100% God. Like, “well I need to be versatile and talk about other things” what else is there to talk about? Are you afraid ymthat when you worship God people are going to snap at you, “keep it down!” That’s pride, it needs to die. It’s not about doing witnessing, is about being one.  You don’t need toys to play with your kids. This life isn’t play time. You don’t need TV shows and games to spend time with your family. Be Christians together. The unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace is the strongest kind of family you will every know. Don’t get busy for God that you don’t love people. That’s what He’s called us to do. Love God and love people. I love the Bible the way I love my eyes, not because my eyes are beautiful but because through them I can see what’s beautiful.

While family is around watch sermons that you’ve already seen. Have them on in the background.

God loves you – a lot. He really does. And I believe he has a plan for you. A mission. I believe you’re chosen – by God, to know a good good Father. Did you know the Bible says all of creation groans and suffers the pains of childbirth until now. Life can feel like slavery to corroption but there’s freedom of glory. I’m telling you this because I loved my while life in church and nobody told me this. Nobody told me about Jesus, knowing Him, being loved by Him.

Stop. I’m supposed to hug you amd pray over you.

I’m sure that sounded really good in your head, but it didn’t make any sense to me at all.

Variations are limited. You won’t get a dog the size of Texas, or as small as a flea.

I’m young but I have the same Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead and He’s going to heal you.

“You have heard it said an eye for an eye.” There was a time that it was right for David to pray against his enemies, but Jesus came and said that time is passed. Love your enemies.

I can say I would rather be away from Garland and at home in Wylie, but that doesn’t at all imply that as soon as I leave Garland I’ll be in Wylie. There’s a city in between.

“ everytime the devil touches you he takes a risk. See here’s what happens the enemy says you know what you’re worthless, that’s his favorite ones you know what he’s totally worthless, he says you’re worthless, and most people say, oh God, and they just crumble Collin. What about when the enemy touches you you don’t rebuke him comma but you take that thought captive. Here’s what that looks like for me: he says you’re worthless as a father I thank you so much, I don’t turn, I need to boldly approach the throne because I live there. So he whispers that and what I say is this, father I thank you so much, you are amazing God, I am so worth the blood of Jesus, if it was only me Jesus would have came for me, God you are amazing thank you for you created me to be.

I don’t want to get married merely because I can’t control my lusts; I want Jesus to take care of that. And if Jesus has taken care of that Paul says there’s no reason to get married.

Righteousness in the OT means right standing with God. Keeping the 613 laws and 10 commandments isn’t equal to righteousness, but if you do them God would give you righteousness. So fast forward to Jesus, new covenant when you believe on Jesus, Righteousness is given to you, not power to do 613 laws and 10 commandments, but you skip all that and go straight to the throne of grave in Jesus name by His keeping of the laws and His right standing before God becomes ours.

## Health

When you run in the morning before breakfast, always run in your target zone. For me, it’s a heart rate between 120 and 150 bmp, which takes a really slow jog not to surpass. Remember that the body does not lose weight based on the distance you run or how fast you go; it loses weight based on your heart rate. It’s easy to remember because it rhymes. So my motto is either your body has done a fast, or you are going fast; never mix the two. I ended up about 1000 times more sweaty and still had my breath the first day I discovered this. “Doing it for 30-minutes first thing in the morning is the same as an hour-and-half later in the day. The body dips into your fat stores as the energy to keep going. You have to do the cardio in your target zone: 220 - your age = number That number is multiplied by .6 as well as by .75”

You can either eat food that looks good, or you can look good.

I love consistency. I drive on consistency. Without consistency I’m miserable. I cannot be consistent spending more money than I make.

God did not make sex to glorify our pleasure. He made sex pleasurable to glorify us. The pleasure is a bonus, not the intention. Sex is the act of becoming one flesh. When we talk about sexual origination, it’s not sharing a pocket book, or a house, or raising kids together that we’re talking. We’re talking about a desire to be intimately physical with a person of the same sex. And if you act on that desire, it makes the purpose of sex about fulfilling that desire instead of being fruitful and multiplying. Pleasure in sex is a good thing. We see that is Songs of Solomon. Sex binds two people’s soul together and that’s s good thing. Why is it wrong if it’s two people who have and same sex? I don’t know, but I have some ideas. Paul calls them dishonorable passions. Dishonorable why? Dishonorable to me or to God? I believe both. Because God designed sex to function between man and wife and we go against his design. That’s dishonoring. For example, I bought a very expensive i7 core processor, 5 TB, 32 GB memory with an amazing graphics card for a friend, and he used it as a TV stand in his room. Like what? Dude, this machine is worth so much more than that. It’s not a TV stand, it’s a computer. Is expensive. It has functionality. And you’re wrecking something very valuable when you use it that way. Right? That dishonored me. It lowered my spirits and made my gift equivilant  to something unimpressive. Sex is very precious as well. More so than a computer. A computer’s function can create all kinds of things, but the function of sex creates life. That’s not something to use as a paperweight. We should treasure it and keep it for its intended use.  It also dishonors you because you look stupid.

When we see boys acting anamalostic? Do we. Ot say, something is wrong with that? Kids having sex. It’s the wrong place. Explain why? We can’t,  ut most of you agree anyway. You know instinctively.

## What Does “Lord” mean?

Faith asked me, “How do you know if you’re a Christian.” After jumping around through a circus of verses, we noticed a theme of confessing Jesus as Lord. 1 Corinthians, Romans 10, even James. The demons believe in God, but they call Satan Lord instead of Jesus. She asked, “what does Lord mean.” I said, “It master or king. Like He’s in charge. It means when you wake up in the morning you don’t say,  hmm what do I feel like doing because I’m in charge. You say Lord what do you want me to do because you’re in charge. Disobedience is a thing in a household, but the master always keeps His authority. Discerning the will of God by the renewal of our mind through the words abiding in us. So when it’s between a cartoon and a sermon, “Who is Lord?” “Jesus.” “What does He want us to do?” or between Bible and playing, “What foes He want us to do?” Don’t just assume it’s the church answer. Really be transformed and discern His will. You’ll give up a lot, but l9ve is keeping commandments (James)

She insisted, “But how do you know you’re saved?” After explaining Ephesians 1:13 to her. I said, “You’re not. *Matt. 7:21* if you are sure you are saved that may very well be an indication that you’re not. Paul said to work out you’re salvation with fear and trembling. Not with Cavalier “I’m a Christian; I’m saved” attitude.” She said, “be sure but don’t be sure? Huh?” I retreated.

People who were shy when they were younger usually suffer from the same disease throughout life. See, the disease isn’t shyness,  that’s just the result. The disease is being afraid of how you look before people. The reason you don’t think you’re shy later in life is because you’ve realized that people praise outgoing outspoken full of yourself personalities more than humble reticent personalities, and you’d rather be a part of that, but the underlying motivation that drives that behavior is the same one that drove shyness: how you look in front of people. That was my experience anyway.

“We need to not just get this attitude of ‘Well that just can’t be right,’

When my little sister says, “You know how hick-ups make you grow?” as a starter to explain her theory of why it works out that way, I don’t say, “Mow stop right there. Hick-ups don’t make you grow, they’re an indicator of growth. You don’t grow because you hick-up, you hick-up because you grow.” I don’t care about the casual order of them, her point is that you can identify growth with hick-ups. In the same way it’s a strawman argument to say, “Works don’t save you, but if you don’t have them you’re not saved because faith produces works. The only person who is concerned about that question is someone who doesn’t have works. They don’t want to hear about the causal relationship, they want to know if they’re saved.

The reason I always struggled with my testimony was because I had nothing to testify. I never experienced the presence of God. I never experienced the power of God. I never experienced His healing or voice or anything out of the ordinary. But my experience of Christianity was some people in a room doing fruitless discussion. My testimony was about learning stuff. “After that I learned that salvation comes by faith alone apart from works.” Sure, most of my life revolved around doing stuff for ministry and I really tried to discern the will of God, but I was such a slave to sin. I was doing pornography, rotting away I side because of it, and I wanted to get out so bad but it wasn’t a matter of willpower. Willpower is like, “Oh, I don’t want that piece of cake over there, so I’m not going to eat it.” This was something different. I hated porn. But for a moment that hatred is numbed, usually when I’m frustrated with something I’m trying to accomplish, porn and sexual relief becomes attractive, body gets flooded with chemicals, the thinking part of my brain is already burned out, and my stomach, that is my appetite becomes my God. Because for a moment I forget with my heart, not always with my brain, but with my heart I forget the deep motivation I have to stay in the kindness and severity of God, to be pure in heart so I can see God, to abide in Christ and bear fruit, I forget Jesus. And then I hear testimonies of people who had drug and porn addiction all there lives and as soon as they come to Jesus, BAM, delivered. They said it wasn’t a twelve step process, it was one step into relationship with Jesus. My problem was that I already took that step. I don’t have another crisis experience left. I came to Jesus before I came to sin. I was baptized before I started masturbating. And once you’ve tasted the heavenly gift and been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, and then have fallen away, it is impossible to renew you again to repentance. So I look at the reality of faith in these people’s life, and my only hope is that I have never tasted the good word of God and the power of the age to come. Because the Writer says if I have, and fallen away, there’s no hope left for me. I’ve used up all the Jesus that I’m allowed to get.  Fallen away from what? From the good word. Another way to say that is the good news or the gospel that we get saved by Christ’s obedience, not our own. You can’t fall away from righteousness  (right standing with God) with faith in Jesus for it. Porn cannot take away you’re right standing with God that you got by grace alone through faith alone. If you want to taste the power of the age to come, tap into the Holy Spirit, you have Him. How fo you get Him in you more? Read. Jesus said His words are Spirit and life. Get His words in you and you become more filled.

If I were to say to you, “I know how you can grow hair on any part of your skin. Check this out: my underarm hair did not start growing until after I started applying deoderent every day. If you want to grow facial hair, put deoderent on it! You might be saying, ‘While one test isn’t very conclusive.’ But I examined 100 people and all of them only started growing arm pit hair after using deodorant. I predicted that result for all 100 people, and 100% of my prediction were accurate.” What would be the fallacy in my argument? I didn’t have positive and negative controls. My posititve control was using the deoderent and the result would be arm pit hair. But in order to conduct a scientific method of experimentation, you need a negative control, being someone who does not use deodorant, and they would have to subsequently see no arm pit hair. Then you would have a basis for your conclusions. But if that person grows arm pit hair without using deoderent, you know that your conclusion was fallacious.

Something that I’ve felt over the years is this sense of disunity in the body of Christ, where everybody is quick to try and weed out “fake Christians” from “real Christians.” It’s like in youth group if you said something you read in the Bible everybody would praise you, but when you step into big church you have to be very careful because someone is always going to disagree with the way you interpret any given passage. There’s so much disagreement about what everything means, and that leads to discensions and denominations, and people leaving church altogether because church is supposed to be this body, this oneness among believers that maybe isn’t being implemented today.

We live in an age where anybody with a phone can access lifetimes of Christian media in an instant. What if we started using this technology as instruments of the Holy Spirit, as instruments of growth? Podcasts, rightnow media, YouTube, are all ways of connecting the body of Christ in ways the early church could never have imagined. Why are we so disconected? Let’s change the game and … symbolism – electro-light. Instruments of the Lord, messengers of God, we have access to the ripest of preaching, the choice fruits of … Christian leaders in the faith to encourage you daily, John Piper, Todd White. Subscribe. Commit. Listen. Grow. Unite. Apply. Learn. Legacy of generations of gurus. Study. The pen of millennials. Change your life. A virtual academy of Christianity, to make disciples. Exalt. Equip. Engage.

I don’t want to argue.  .. I do. Argument is good and healthy.  When two ideas are opposed they should argue and may the best idea win. It’s how ideologies are refined. It’s how slavery was abolished and how tyranny is put under for. Sure, argument tears people apart. Argument on a personal level is bad. Don’t listen defensively. Argue on a professional level. I said nothing about the person of

Imagine all the people who have secretly liked you over the years… whoa O.o

I grew up in the most dangerous, unlikely place to be saved in the world. An American Christian home. See people are always sharing “their” testimony about how hard things got and then they found solace in God. That’s nice and cute and all, but don’t you find it interesting that you don’t find anything even tangent to that in the Bible? People don’t testify about how they “found” Jesus in the Bible, they testify about the resurrected Son of God who came to die and destroy death in as many as would believe on Him. I’ve never seen anybody come to Jesus because of a youth group, self-focused, agenda crafted story about what got you to say a prayer. “And ever since then I’ve been living for God.” Living for God? What a joke. You’re waking up in the morning, going to school, doing mostly what you like to do, pursuing your own pursuits, and, well lets cut this short and summerize with Jesus’ words, “eating, drinking, building,” and just living life.  Your testimony: somebody said something and over time you became depressed and didn’t want to wake up in the morning…on my comfortable bed, in a comfortable house, in a comfortable neighborhood, city, state, country. Ohh, poor baby. – this isn’t Christianity. God loves these people. It’s time you learned to as well.

This is a bad analogy but when my brothers and I go biking, we often take a route with this giant hill. We’re talking huge. But when we’re going up it, I try and go as fast as I can because that’s how you get up hills easier, low gear and high speed, but when we get to the top, I’m out of breath and I can barely go on. The interesting thing is, after coming back, when we go down the hill, at the bottom I am even more burned out then when I go up it. We’re talking I have tears running down my eyes, completely winded wondering if my lungs will keep on breathing because every gasp feels like my last one. The reason is because when I’m going up the hill my mentality is, “I can’t do this,” and, “If I don’t do this I’m not getting to the top.” Going down the hill we’re trying to break a speed record (38 mph for me so far), so in my head is, “YEEAAHHH. I can do this!” And no matter what, I’m getting to the bottom of that hill. Christianity is going down the hill. No matter what, you’re going to make it. You don’t live for Christ to make it to heaven, and if you don’t go hard enough you won’t make it to the top of the hill, you live for Christ to “break your speed record,” as it were. But if you are sealed with the Holy Spirit as the earnest of your salvation, either you’re going to heaven or the Holy Spirit is going to hell with you, and the latter isn’t going to happen.

A nuemonic device is a memory tool, such as using different color text to help the brain absorb the material factor, or using acronyms. Another device is to use humor when presenting to get people laughing, because when you start speaking a certain percentage of people aren’t listening yet. They’re not quite cued in. But if everybody starts laughing, those who weren’t paying attention: “What are they laughing about?”

Nearly every atheist I meet does not live like their worldview is true. The atheist worldview is inconsistent with their lifestyles. If we’re just stardust, a collection of chemicals and compounds that somehow react to produce conscious thought, we can’t talk about anything in terms of good or bad, but atheists use those words all the time. This has never been a useful argument for me because no atheist I know is willing to admit that morality, on their worldview, is nonsense. But if I’m star dust, and you’re stardust, what’s the big deal about me killing you? You’d still be stardust in a different state of being. You’re still part of the universe. You can’t say that it would be bad for me to kill you. Atheists generally concoct an ideal of morality that says whatever betters society is good, and whatever is bad for society is bad. But why? I mean truthfully speaking, the universe tends toward a state of thermodynamic disorder. Life is a rebellion against what the universe is trying to do. So if I kill you, I’m just helping the universe along its natural propensity. How can this be thought of as a bad thing? It’s natural. The universe is trying to tear you apart, why shouldn’t I help it along? Or again, if you don’t accept that, accept this: humankind may be the highest evolved creature on your worldview, but advances in society over time is bad for the earth we inhabit. We take its natural resources and turn it into thermal energy, helping entropy along its course. We cut down millions of trees every year in the name of society. We pollute the oceans and air for the betterment of society. What’s good for society is bad for the earth and everything in it, including society. The problem is that when we talk about good and bad, it has to be subjective in this worldview, which means you can’t say, “This is bad,” you have to say, “This is bad for. . .” But you can’t give me a reason not to do something that’s good for me and bad for you, because if I take morality to be subjective, the subject of morality must be me. The good of one thing is almost invariably opposed to the good of something else. I can’t be concerned with what’s good for cockroaches and disease. Or what’s good for you if it’s bad for me. What’s good for cancer is bad for me. But I think almost every atheist believes in things like compassion, but I haven’t heard any compelling argument that makes sense of such illogical behavior and feelings in the absence of a holy Creator and Judge of the universe.

What’s good for one thing is almost invariably opposed to the good of something else (if we suppose that a collection of stardust changing its chemical construct from organic matter to some other form is bad). Show me that it’s bad for chemicals to react in my brain in such a way that it produceious conscious thought opposed to the chemicals in your brain that produces conscious behavior. If I say, “You should die because you are homosexual,” which is a form of punishment I do not subscribe to under the new covenant of Jesus’s blood, but if I were to say it, and chemicals react in your brain to produce conscious thought that gets offended by that, show me that’s bad. It’s just chemicals. Why is it bad for a particular collection of chemicals and compounds to change into another form of stardust? The universe tends towards thermodynamic disorder, so if you get thrown into a fire, and the chemical collection we call your life or you, is transformed into thermal energy, the universe has just been aided in its inevitable direction of movement, which is good for entropy. Fire is good for entropy. Let everything burn if there is no one to answer to and no such thing as compassion. In fact your own natural tendency is toward death. It’s just nature. You dying is natural. How can that be thought of as bad?

The fruit of the Spirit in the life of the believer is not prescriptive, it’s descriptive.

Lifestyle Christianity doesn’t say, “Who do men say You are?,” But “Who do You say You are?”

I love Jesus, yes I do, for the Bible tells me to. His Holy Spirit to us belong, we will not be here for long.

I saw that movie, “Miracles From Heaven,” and near the end the the little girl that was dying saw a butterfly and climbed up a tree. She fell into a hole and lay there for 3 hours. After she was pulled out she told of her experience in the tree. She said she was out of her body, looking at it, and the scene portrayed the Holy Spirit as a butterfly flying around in there with her. And my heart went, “THAT’S HIM!!!” It was the most exciting thing I’ve seen in a movie ever in my life. The Holy Spirit is something I’ve sought for years and years. I’ve heard about Him in the Bible, I know Him and what He can do and who He is. But when the Holy Spirit was portrayed as that little butterfly, it somehow tangiblized Him in a way that lifted my spirits through the roof. It’s this feeling of, “He’s here! Everything is perfect now. There’s nothing to worry about anymore, He is right there, and He loves us. There’s nothing that can go wrong.” As she continued to relate her experience, she was caught up into paradise, a place only dreamed about in the purest of minds, but I couldn’t find Jesus there. And it was happy and beautiful, but I was sobbing to find Jesus there, and then she ascended to the sky, walking on clouds, and peeking through other clouds was the glory of God, and all was complete. He was there. Treasuring God in your mind is something different then treasuring Him with your heart. The truth is that butterfly, the Holy Spirit, is in the hearts of those who believe, right there with us all the time. He’s our comforter. And that’s nothing to be casual about. HE’S HERE!!! Everything is perfect! Just like that scene in the movie. The moment I saw that I knew that there is nothing else I want. I walked out of that movie and saw a woman limping out. I thought, “She came here with hope that she might know a miracle herself. I passed by three times with the conviction, “Go pray for her and let Jesus administer healing in her body right now.” I can surrender everything to God, and I don’t care how I look to anybody in the world -- except my family who was with me that night. There’s this one part of me that withholds me from the purpose of God, and it needs to die. The next day I prayed in the closet that she would be healed, because I know and related to God what I had read in Numbers that morning, that the power of God is not limited, and His power isn’t limited to the conventional ways people have healed by laying their hands on the sick. I believe God healed that woman. I can’t. But I have what that butterfly represented in me, on me, around me. They can’t see Him, but if they experience Him maybe their eyes will be opened. If you believe it, live like it.

Let’s talk about the top 3 reasons that you did (or are doing) this. (For decisions like moving out, or whatever else).

I’ve been cleaned! You can’t sear my conscience. Maybe you’ve never experienced the baptism from above. You see, Peter said baptism isn’t getting wet, you get wet all the time, but baptism is a clean conscience before God. I lived 17 years saved as a Christian without one. And I was miserable the whole time coming. But God washed me and sent me a comforter, and now I’m clean. How would that hit you to know that there’s no dirt in you at all anymore? People said, “You’re always going to be tempted.” Wrong. I have the Holy Spirit, He’s right here. He keeps me from defiling my mind like it was when I was a son of disobedience. It’s not a fight, it’s Jesus.

If it were the case that fossil’s evidence showed evolution to be true beyond the limitations we find today, the Smithsonian Natural Museum of History would be filled with these examples, but instead they’re not.

The world would be better without religion. - Okay so now we’re not talking about the science of it and coming to a conclusion that matches reality, we’re talking about, “What do I want to be true?” Since you asked me a distraction question, can I now ask you a distraction question? I just want to know; I’m not priming an argument here. Do you fear death?

I.e. I don’t believe that but that’s not the point of debate this evening so I won’t waste time arguing about it.

I’m a vegetable rights activist.

## Carnal Christian Or Sinless Son?

It comes down to what I believe happens when a person recieves the Holy Spirit. Do they continue to sin, or do they live holy? Jesus came for the sick, but he came to make them healthy. I’ve always been a believer in the reality of carnel Christianity, but something in me cries out hoping it isn’t true. It’s difficult to make James and 1 John fit into Paul, but it’s even harder to make Paul fit into James and John. There is something inside that holds on to hope that I don’t have the Holy Spirit, because if I do there’s no hope for me to get rid of my sin. My sin keeps me from enjoying fellowship with my Father. There’s no way around it for me. It happens like that every time. So I don’t want to stay on this earth if my sin stays with me. I just don’t have enough tears to last a whole life in sin. I hate it so much. Even apart from the wedge it draws between me and God, I have a very sensitive conscience, and it makes me feel dirty, insecure, weak, unwantabe, gross, and disgusting. I don’t want to live that way. I don’t want to live this way. This lust is a part of my whether I like it or not. I have the drive to look at naked girls, to hear their screams of pleasure even though I know they’re just acting, to watch them have sex with men. I don’t want these desires, but can’t get rid of them, and in 8 years of saying “that was the last time” the last time is yesterday, but another last time is on its way. In 8 years of strategies and fighting and misery and self-hatred,  have not conquered my own lust as my lord. It is my master. I will not hide the truth. I carry out what it wants, not what God wants. Who is lord of me? My lust is. Who will save me from this body of death? And then the answer comes: JESUS. But what isf he’s already saved me? Then salvation is not what I thought it would ve. I’ve got to be honest lest I end up in hell, I can’t say, “I know you,” the perishing think that so I fit into that criteria already. My experience with God could be a delusion, from the enemy. I need to examine the scriptures and they say no one who knows you continues to sin. I beieve that, and I do, so I’ve never seen you. I say this with tears.

You can make the Bible say anything you want it to by cherry-picking your versions.

I don’t believe there is an equation to get the Holy Spirit, as if belief plus the absolute value of baptism equals being indwelt by the Holy Spirit, or the derivative of belief to the power of one equals Holy Spirit in you. Your famous Ephesians 1:13 verse is *shocker* about the Ephesians. “In Him, *you* also, after listening to the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation—having also believed, you were sealed in Him with the Holy Spirit of promise, who is given as a pledge of our inheritance, with a view to the redemption of God’s own possession, to the praise of His glory.” The reason I say this isn’t a good basis for equation-type theology is because in that passage Paul says nothing about a standard way of receiving the Holy Spirit, or a normative expectation that you can plug into a calculator to evaluate if you’re saved or not, but rather he is looking at something that happened to these people in the past, not giving criteria for what would happen to people in the future. The entire greeting is tailored specifically for this group of people. For example, He addresses it “To the saints who are at Ephesus,” noting that they are faithful in Christ Jesus (v. 1), having love for all the saints (v. 15). He uses both “we” language and “you” language in this chapter, and verse 13 is “you” language.” But the main reason I interpret that verse as a historical account of this specific people instead of a doctrine of getting the Holy Spirit is because in the Book of Acts there is no standard way of receiving the Holy Spirit whatsoever. Take chapter 8, when the apostles came down to the believers at Samaria they saw that the Holy Spirit had not yet fallen upon any of them, so they began laying their hands on them, and they were receiving the Holy Spirit (v. 17). So now we have an equation that says belief plus baptism plus the laying on of apostles’ hands equals the Holy Spirit. Or in the next chapter, the man Saul (later Paul) received the Holy Spirit when Ananias laid hands on him and told him what God had sent him to do, before baptism. So now we’ve got another equation, belief plus the laying on of a disciple’s hands equals the Holy Spirit coming on you. Or in the next chapter after that, the Holy Spirit falls on an entire company of gentiles who were listening to Peter speaking about the gospel. So now we have another equation, the hearing of the gospel equals the Holy Spirit coming on you. Go through the book of Acts chapter by chapter on Bible gateway, and keyword search “Spirit” (Ctrl+F), and look for the passages that talk about the Spirit falling on someone, and just about every one of them is different. The Spirit comes on those whom He comes on, and if you have Him or not is not a question of looking in the review mirror, but looking in the wall mirror. It isn’t something you can approach with the scientific method, making prediction and testing with experimentation, with positive and negative control groups. But the way to know it is what Jesus said in Luke 6, you know a tree by its fruit. Everyone who is born of God does not continue to sin (1 John 3:6). Are you continuing in sin? Then work out your salvation with fear and trembling.

The reason I take Hebrews with a grain of salt is not because I’m just cherry picking what I like and rejecting what I don’t like. That would be to my own peril and not for profit. But it’s because the books were not vindicated by God with confirmation to show they were from him. Paul was vindicated. The gospels were vindicated. But the New Testament books were not considered scripture until the council of Hyppo declred them cannon 200 years later, somewhat arbitrarily, with a random criteria not grounded in the Bible anywhere. When Paul said that to Timothy, he was talking about the OT. When the Bureans examined the apostles words with sxripture, they weren’t comparing it with the apstles letters. That would be silly. The New Testament is not all vindicated.

The Christian life is not about thriving. If there is no resurrection we are to be pitied most among men. Why? Because we lived the most blessed life? No, because we’ve sacrificed, we’ve suffered for righteousness sake. I get really bothered by people teaching, “Do good get good.” Have you read the book of Job? That’s what his friends taught and God said they darkened council. If you’re going to be loyal to God, it’s 

They would give me scriptures, and I would give them scriptures in return to justify it, because you can make the Bible say whatever you want if you’re smart enough, and I was just brilliant. Pastors  couldn’t out debate me.

What doYou do? I lovepeople for a living man .

I would love to talk about why I left Northlake, but my reasons were not-hearted, and therefore I cannot explain it quickly.

God wants to take you to the island at DBU and do the intimate things people do there, which is make decisions. Decisions about how you are going to spend the rest of your life, and more importantly who you will be spending it for and with.

“Come with me.” I would but then I’d have to propose to you, and who would say no to this face? So then we’d get married and have kids and when God wants you out on the mission field you’d be stuck with our little goo goos at home. You may quote me.

The reason we we’re loyal to God is not so that w can get a raise at work, that’s demonic. The reason we’re loyal to God is so that we know Him better. That’s eternal life.

God, I am afflicted. Receive glory and honor forever! I don’t want this rash and itch gone, I just want the itch of lust and the rash of guilt gone. It is not my pain in the body that casts down my heart, but the sin which dwells in my body. For I am tempted as clouds passing over the sun, and when it comes I succumb to it. My inner person wastes away, and the seed which was planted in me becomes barren. Oh how miserable I am  on account of my sin! There is no profit under the sun which a man may attain from the lust of the eyes. I am a slave to that which I hate. Who will set me free from this body of death? Let me never be content with false knowledge, but saturate me in Your truth that I may know whether the Spirit was given to me. For I am blind and my teary eyes cannot see. Open my eyes! I don’t want comfort, I want the comforter. Even now I become tempted. Please put in me self-control, lest my mind becomes like that of an animal and I lose all sanity. I weep before you God, cleanse me and purify me. Wash me, and renew my mind. Make me a new creation, I so sick. I love you God, don’t withhold Yourself from me.

Scar was craftier than mufassa, but the mighty king was a wiser ruler than sxar ever was. The problem with scars rule is that he let tH hyinnas be joined with the pride. In the chuch today, we have let the hyinnas in.

The reason the question “what caused the universe?” isn’t absurd is because we can show that is doesn’t exist necessarily, but contingently. “What caused God?” on the other hand makes no sense to ask because God, if He exists, exists necessarily and does not depend on anything else.

Inverse operations like subtraction and division are simply prohibited in transfinite arithmetic.

When the rich young ruler asked Jesus how to get to heaven, Jesus responded with how to get to heaven with man, not God. He told him how to be complete in the law, not how to be forgiven under grace. I’ve heard people confuse that, but Jesus makes it obvious in the next verses when He says “With man it is impossible.” So forget that; the only hope you have is with God.

*retired leader, lost his love and left into soletude* we need you – what business have you with a dead man? Let the shadows reside in the darkness. - I can heal that –… so can I – why don’t you – the pain of the body eases the pain of the mind. It’s distracting.

I was dog sitting one time, and one of the dogs slipped on something and started limping. So I ran in there and said, “I thank you Lord in Jesus name that you would heal her leg, right now in Jesus name.” Nothing happened, I said it again, “I thank you for a brand new leg in Jesus name,” and it began to shake and stretch out, “more Lord Jesus,” and every time she ran by I said, “Thank You in Jesus name for healing her leg,” because she’s dog. I don’t have to worry about how I look in front of her. When healing didn’t come, no big deal, I’ll pray again.

I don’t believe music was meant to be enjoyed the way food is meant to be enjoyed, and then you glorify God because it’s good. Music is more expressive, an instrument to glorify God.

This thing is really hard to beat. Ever since I learned how twisted it was… and I remember exactly when that was, it was 7th grade, about a year after I started looking at pornography, I was in discipleship class and we read through Matthew 5, and I went, *jaw drops* “Lust is equal to adaltury? And you get thrown into hell because of it? I’m going to hell. I need to get rid of this. I will never look at another picture as long as I live.” That was it for me. I made the decision right there that I was never going to look at pornography ever again, and that’s when the battle started. Because soon afterward, guess what? I looked at pornography. “AHH! What did I do? Never again!” A year of _never agains_ passes by. I am depraved at this point. It turns into four years, eight years, I write songs to beat this thing, I memorize scripture to battle it, I put pseudo-tattoos of verses and mottos on my wrists so that I’ll see them when I’m tempted, I wear bracelets with verses so that I won’t forget, I make sermon jams, read articles, write articles, fast from my computer and phone, write prayers, prayed 5,000 times, tried different strategies, 7 step strategies, 12 step strategies, identify the triggers, write a deactivation sequence, YouTube channels, current research, confession; I’ve done everything I could think of to beat this and the last option I have is to blow my brains out, because that will finally get me to stop. But before I do that, there is one hope I have left up my sleeve. The hope that I have never tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come. That’s my hope. It’s a little backwards, isn’t it? Hoping that I’m not truly a Christian. But from my perspective, if I already had the Holy Spirit, and I’m still a slave to sin, I don’t have another savior to get me free from this. Jesus is the only One I know. So I would go to passages like 1 John 3:6 that says if you’ve seen God or know Him you don’t continue to sin. I plug myself into that flow of logic and come out with the conclusion that I have never seen or known God, which means I still have hope. I can get Jesus, and He will set me free. But then another problem comes up, because if I don’t have Jesus, I don’t know how to get Him. The Bible says believe. Confess Jesus as Lord, and believe in Your heart that God raised Him from the dead. Check and double-check. But I haven’t been saved. Eternal life is knowing God, John says I have never known God, therefore I don’t have eternal life. So where did I go wrong? I’m still sinning, I hate this thing, I’m an abomination to myself, I’m deplorable to myself, I’m in darkness, and the Bible says if I say I have fellowship with God and yet walk in darkness I lie and do not practice the truth.

*Compliment* “oh can’t a man keep a secret!” (mr. Howl)

I used to walk a different path. I tasted the world, and it tasted good like a piece of cake, but the more you eat the less you like it until it makes you sick.

Do you know what I see when I look at you? A butterfly in the dirt. I mean, have you ever thought about what it’s like to be a caterpillar?

I’m really not picky about the friends I choose. Peopl are like, “You need to be careful about the friends you choose.” And then they’ll quote a proverb. I’m like, “That sounds like an excuse to not be light in the darkness.” Like if it’s dark, and you walk in, it’s not dark anymore because you’re light. That’s what Jesus said, you’re the light of the world.

If the gospel was complicated it would be exclusive to the very inelegant, but Jesus said, “I praise You Father because you have withheld these things from the wise and revealed them to infants.”

I was purchased with the blood of Jesus

Satan does not need God’s permission to do evil, or to do you harm. Do you understand that the Bible says he’s the god of this world? And when he tempted Jesus in Matthew chapter 4 he reveals that authority over the world has been given to him. Satan is not on a leash, and God doesn’t just sit back and watch him do evil. He’s given Satan authority over this world.

Why does God allow anything that’s absent of Himself (anything that’s evil)? God must have an enormous respect for free will. But not in the sense where he sits back and says, “Wait no, let’s see what he does” like Crush on Finding Nemo. Don’t get it twisted, all the weights of the bag are His concern. We don’t worship a passive Father who doesn’t care. *Pause*. Jesus wept for Lazarus. He could’ve prevented it. Why did He allow something to happen that would grieve Himself? I believe it was because after the suffering comes glory. For a little while it hurts, but when  you’ve known the hurt, and Lazarus comes out of the grave, there’s something better than ever on the other side of the pain. God let the absence of His good nature, He let death claim Lazarus, because the world belongs to Satan. To sin. God allowed those pigs to be possessed by demons because their appointed time to be cast into the Abyss had not yet come. I believe it’s out of respect for His holy angels. Like David who wouldn’t touch the ballistic evil king Saul because He was anointed of God. The angels were made holier than any man. The angels were created with dignity. And just like God wouldn’t destroy the people of Canaan for 400 years until their sin was complete, so God is waiting now for the final judgment when death and hades and all that is evil will be cast into the lake of fire which was prepared for the fallen angels.

Lazarus – he was waiting for it to be complete, until the ressurection happened. In the beginning God was waiting for the word of God, because He cannot do anything without the word.

“Unrealistic list of expectation,” doesn’t sound like a conversation you need to be having with her, it is a conversation that Dad needs to have with her husband. Because as far as she’s concerned, he’s the head of the household and it’s her place to submit to him. And she is to honor him, not complain or speak evil of him. It’s his place to do a better job discerning what it means to love his wife the way Christ loved the church. The way Christ loved the church. How did He love the church? Conditionally? With great expectation? He said my burden is light and my yoke is easy. Come to me and find rest. Principles are good. We’re in a reprobate culture. But just understand it’s not all about this world. Sow eternal seeds in your kids, don’t worry about always keeping your house clean with 6 children. You do that by making your kids principled, not your wife.

No offense, but your prayers haven’t proven to be that effective in the past.

Dad: “This only has 700 hundred MB ram on it.” Anna: “Not even a gig!” Ethan: “Wow! That’s like a piece of history!” Dad: “I was going to say a piece of something else, but, you know…”

Hey do you guys know God? – yes – awesome that means a lot to me. Do you want to pray with me right now? – what about? – what do you need prayer for? Let’s just thank. Or . Who  cares? It’s our Father, and we can jump before that throne of grace right now.

If God can glorify us in heaven, why can’t he make us perfect on earth? I mean, we die and then suddenly we live without sin for eternity? What happens to free will on such a scenario? But if freewill can indeed coexist with no sin because of an act of God, why then does He not perform that act in us? Perhaps because only through Jesus we can be glorified, and as soon as we get saved we could be snatched up and taken to heaven, but if that happened there would be no diciples making disciples and the world would be left without hope.

Convenient that you left out clause 15.1, “Everyone has the right to freedom of conscience, religion, thought, belief and opinion.” Equality is a concept that people need to understand applies “before the law” (Clause 9.1). Not to bring up that the misquoted clause cited above reads, “The *state* may not unfairly discriminate…” What is unfair discrimination anyway? In my opinion it’s discrimination which judges a person by something not pertaining to the content of their character. So-called sexual orientation has to do with behavior, not a person. If you make a distinction between a child molester and the child he or she molested, so that you speak against child molestation, is that not fair? The reason I believe most of us will agree about the child molester is because the child molester crosses a moral line and separates himself from being a good person in society.

The problem is morality can’t be shown to be true or untrue apart from God, and therefore it falls under the characterization of a belief as far as the law is concerned. All pastor Anderson is doing is speaking his beliefs, or recognizing a distinction between people on either sides of a moral line. This hotel on the other hand is not only discriminating against Anderson’s belief which is protected under clause 9.4, and 15.1, his “freedom to receive or impart information or ideas” protected under clause 16.1 (b), but their also acting on it. It’s not just talk with Premier Hotel, it’s straight up injustice and unfair treatment. This decision was built on the grounds of sectarian views that violate the clause they used to justify themselves.

“If everyone pirated companies would go out of business!” “If everyone was single the humanity would die out, yet I notice you’re not married.”

Paul sAys you can dress up as a man, you can put youself in mens clothing but it doesn’t make you a man. Being a women is more than just your genetalia. It’s a certain role to play, a position, a personality, and you can step out of any of that but it doesn’t change who you are, it just puts you out of your place.

She’s a little shy. – oh well me too. See? We’re birds of a feather.

it’s been a couple of weeks since I’ve looked at porn. I have been progressively getting better, but I would not consider myself out of its influence yet.

You need to know that you are fearfully and wonderfully made. Not just hear, but know it. You are remarkable, that’s what my Bible says. God knew what he was doing when he fashioned you in your mother’s womb. It says He knows your frame. You’re a jewel. You’re worth more than gold. And these thoughts that challenge that worth are lies from the enemy. Jesus died for you. You were purchased at the highest price heaven could pay. For you. I want so badly for you to see that.

If God does not love them it is hardly likely that we will make it our business to love them. Especially is this the case when there is so much that is repulsive in the ungodliness and sinfulness of Christ-rejecters. 

What does hate have to do with love? In my experience, hate is perfectly compatible with love. They are not opposites. The true opposite of love is indifference, and God is never indifferent toward you.

How dare you people say these things in the name of love and acceptance. You hypocrites! Or don’t you realize you accept what is evil and reject what is good? Isaiah prophesied rightly about you when he said, “They will call good evil and evil good.” You masquerade as advocates of tolerance and peace and love, all the while hating and despising the good word of God. Is sodomy right? It is an abomination. I speak even if the adulterer and fornicator and pornicator and all forms of sexual impurity. I speak even of myself. The good news of God is that Jesus came out of love for us and hated for our iniquities and the worker of iniquities to save us. Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God. Such were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God. Do not reject this gospel for a gospel-so-called. Be washed and be justified and be sanctified.

I can’t afford to have my doctrine be about pushing an agenda. I just want to know about God. I know He’s beautiful. If it’s a question of “Does God hate?” That’s not a question about doctrine that’s a question about God.

We’ve taken the meaning of, “No one knows when Jesus will return” and reversed it. Jesus said, “Nobody knows” so that we wouldn’t go, “Okay, Jesus is returning in 30 years, I’ll spend 29 having a nice preppy life and the next year I’ll be sold out for the gospel.” Jesus meant, “No, always be prepared because you don’t know when I’m coming back. Act like it’s tonight.” But we’ve taken it as, “Well who knows when He’s coming back? Let’s eat, drink and be marry. Let’s build and trade and live life. Oh and I need to live for God so let’s all gather in a little church and talk about Him one or two days a week.” I tell you that I’ve spend 2 years of my life working on ministry resources, Sermon Jams, motion graphics, kinetic typography, static verse typography, songs, and all kinds of things “for Jesus.” What we need to understand is Jesus didn’t ask for those things. “Martha, Martha,” wake up and sit at the feet of Jesus for a moment so that you can stop spending so much time working on church growth strategies and cool events for the youth group and keeping up with the latest patterns of the world in technology so that we can look just like it. Discern the will of God. He wants us out there on the mission field living like the church that’s sold out for the gospel. We live together, we go together. It isn’t, “Well you need to work and support missionaries.” Stop it. The gospel isn’t, “I’m holding the rope and you’re climbing down the well.” It’s the good news of Jesus that’s the only hope for a lost and dying world. It’s the Bread from heaven that all creation is groaning for. Stop animating the gospel and start sharing it. The church needs to wake up. If you weren’t meant to be a witness than Jesus would’ve taken you up to heaven the minute you got saved. There’s a reason your still on this earth, and it’s not to wait around until you’re off it.

The farther away from the Greek we get the farther away we get from what Jesus actually said.

Hatred may not be in your vocabulary but it isn’t a word, it’s a treatment. It’s a feeling of despise for something somebody stands for. All that heated means you have communicated and expressed against this man.

“Many grown-ups talk that way, and there’s just no need for it. There are so many words to choose from in our language. It says a lot about you when you choose words that show respect for the feelings of others.” ~ Mamma Bear

“Well how do you like that smart phone in you pocket hmm? How do you like the car you’re driving hmm? It was scientists who invented that.” No, evolutionary biologists did not design my smart phone. Theoretical physicists did not design the car that I drive. Engineers did that.

Don’t be so concerned about how people perceive you. They called Jesus Beelzabub, they nailed Him to the cross. And Jesus said that they hated Him because He testified of they’re works that they’re works were evil.

Jesus is my treasure and love is my currency. I don’t work for money. Jesus paid it all. You can’t buy Jesus with silver and gold. You want to pay me? Go love someone. Give somebody Jesus. That’s love. I’m not an orphan. Go find one.

These will not enter into the kingdom of God. “Anybody can if you believe!” Can, perhaps, but will not. Jesus came so that the veil separating God and man would split. The only way to live like Jesus is to know Him and the Father. That's what Jesus accomplished on the cross. The veil split and now we can come before God. Jesus came so that whoever would believe on Him would not perish but have eternal life. May have. Not forced to have. Eternal life is knowing Jesus. You can believe in Jesus and go about your way and never know him. The reason you stop sinning is if you know Him. If you know Him, if you have eternal life, if you are abiding in Him and eternal lie is abiding in you, you will not continue to sin. There is no darkness is Him. He is light. They cannot coexist.

I don’t believe that the people who translated the NIV had in mind, “We will prepare the world to accept lucifer as the anti-Christ!” Well meaning people just take the manuscripts that were corrupted 200 years after Jesus and because they are the oldest that’s what they translate. So they leave out Acts 8:37, not because they have a catholic agenda, but because they’re translating a manuscript that was probably tampered with by people in the early church era who tampered with the scriptures. They did that back then, you know. Paul testified to it, warned against it, and said don’t circulate that heresy. Therefore, per the instructions of Paul, Codex Synaticus was thrown in a trash can (and therefore preserved because it wasn’t used) while the true texts were be read, copied, used, wearing from use, and more and more were being written which is why Errasmus had 5,000 manuscripts to work with instead of Codex Synaticus and Codex Vaticanus.

Have you ever noticed how people aren’t attracted to me? And I’m super good-looking so it’s weird. But the reason is because people think of me as a eunuch of sorts. Like a Jesus sort of figure. Or perhaps like Dr. Emil on Smallville.

I don’t believe Satan is scared of your Bible. We all think he’s going to come along and say, “Hath God said?” But more times than not he’s saying, “God hath said.” He’s not mainly concerned with putting a question mark where God put a period, I believe he’s more occupied by rearranging the meaning of God’s word. He just wants to tamper with it a little bit. And little by little our docrines begin to change.

A little bit a Greek is dangerous. If everybody could learn Greek and be fluent in it and read the text for themselves, that would be great. But people who’ve taken two semesters of the language isolate a word and think they know better than the brilliant scholars who took 7 years to translate the KJV? People who are on their first semester of Greek are the worst. “Oh I can’t believe they translated this that way!” Well, maybe they know more than you. The KJV was so incredibly well crafted, no one word went without careful examination. And we think we can just go to biblehub.com in the Greek section and go, “Oh look at that! The ESV got that one wrong! I’m going preach such a good sermon on this word.”

“Hey can I talk to you guys?” “Yeah.” “Awesome. Well listen up because I am at the head of cutting edge new shopping techniques. How many of you guys buy stuff? …like deodorant, soup, shampoo, energy drinks?” Hands “Well what if I told you that you could buy the same or better product for the same of cheaper price? Would you be interested in that?” “sure.” “Have any of you heard of Amway? So here’s what you need to know. With normal retail stores from the manufactur … but with Amway it ships straight to your home. Network marketing is the wave of the future. They carry tp of the line products at cheaper prices than anywhere else. How many of you want in? To know more about it?”

Or if you want to sign up and become an Amway distributor you can do that too, and you'll get a percentage of whatever you buy right back. And if you refer someone to Amway, you get a percentage of whatever they buy back as well. It's like . . . How many of you have onedrive? And if you refer someone you get a bonus 500mg right? Amway is like that, but you keep on getting the bonus for as long as they yse tge products. Sign 100 people up, most people pay – on their – bill, and you can retire.

Woe to you who come in the likeness of the Pharisees Your knowledge has become a curse to you. Or do you not recognize that out of Eden it was necessary for the body to be covered? And Moses when he went before God could not walk up est his skirt be seen by thise below. And why do you suppose it was written, “You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s wife, for it is your fathers nakedness”?

You know that song that says I’ll never know how much it cost it needs to be changed I need to know how much it cost because your costs determines R-value it would be a shame for you to go through life and not know your value

You wouldn’t ask me that if you knew who you were.

Hey man! I’m Ethan. I just wanted to tell you that God loves you. He really does, like, so much.

Your cost determines your value. You don’t pay more for something than what its worth. Heaven went bankrupt to purchase you.

We need to be so careful when we preach love, because it can be self-defeating. When you see somebody holding up a sign that says, “God hates fags,” and you rush over to condemn their stone-throwing, you yourself throw a stone at them with the weapon of “love.” People hate other people in the name of love. It really bothers me when I see this. Steven Anderson gets way more persecution for his stance on homosexuality than any gay person has gotten from him. Our job is to overcome good with evil, not become what we’re fighting. We’re just becoming a different flavor of the same poison.

Jesus said the way you know about the tree is by its fruit. That means one way that you can tell if somebody is preaching from God is if the works Jesus is in them. If His commandments are alive in them. I saw an article about Todd White, and it was written by very needy people, because they need Jesus. It broke me down to read the things they were saying in there. It didn’t make me mad, I was hurting for them. The article I read was a dialogue between them and a girl named Addy who was defending Todd White. After the first message, I thought, “Oh God help these people. They speak out arrogantly against your kids. Draw them to Yourself.” Because Addy’s first message was basically this: “Please think before you publish accusations like that because these are serious men who represent God so you're not only insulting them but you're also insulting God.” And their response was, “We’re proving false teachers aren’t men of God. Why can’t you see this? Because you’re false and the god you serve is Satan, father of liars, thieves, and murderers.” That’s not Christianity. That’s the boastful pride of life. And it’s not from the Father, but from the world. From one message that said, “Please be careful who you denounce,” they made the judgement that Addy serves Satan. She responded by asking how they came to that judgment and said, “You’re better than this.” They replied with scriptures that said false prophets would come with signs and wonders and finished with, “Just who are you, thinking you know better than Jesus and Paul? We’ve given proof from the Lord that Todd White is false; where is your proof that God is untrue? You have nothing.” They need to understand that signs and wonders do not automatically make you a false teacher. Jesus said they would accompany believers. But the main thing I keep seeing is this pattern of accusation and judgment that is not right judgment coming from these Christ proclaimers. In Addy’s defense she noted that his proof is what the Pharisees claimed about Jesus too in Matthew 12:24. Paul and Victor responded with first a proverb of “Whoever answers before listening is both foolish and shameful.” With the advice, “You need to read and understand all that’s provided before dismissing what it says.” Proceeding with more accusations against Todd White, “He also talks up love, but not repentance, the cross, or true holiness.” All untrue of the man. If they had seen even one of his conference videos they would know Todd is all about the cross and living in holiness. You can see the fruit of Christ in him, and he lives holy. That’s why his ministry is called Lifestyle Christianity, because it’s about Jesus 24/7 not just on Sunday. So apparently these men have violated their own advice to Addy by not “reading and understanding all that’s provided.” And have you noticed they’re u emphasis on repentance? This while letter started to make sense when I realized they might be a Lordship Salvationist. Have you noticed that the people who emphasize repentance are the ones who live the worst lives? It’s kind of ironic, because the Bible states over and over and over God hates pride and wants you humble, and when you correct someone do it in gentleness and patience so that it gives grace to those who hear. These men later on said this: “Here we are, Addy, answering you responsibly and giving you every opportunity to turn from your shallow, unexamined, satanic defense of man and yourself rather than identification with the Lord Jesus Christ by His cross. Love has been speaking to you. In return, you’ve been flippant and disrespectful to the Lord and His servants, not recognizing Him or His Presence. Not good at all. You need to sober up and repent, big time.” I was a little confounding when I read this paragraph. “Love has been speaking to you. In return, you’ve been flippant and disrespectful”? Addy was the one conducting herself in respect and gentleness and according to the commandments of Christ in the Bible. These men on the other hand made things personal and used all kinds of disrespectful, non-gentle, unloving, impatient words and applied them to Addy. They called her, “False, a servant of Satan, foolish and shameful,” asked, “Just who are you?” called her “shallow, unexamined, satanic, flippant, and disrespectful,” complained about her offense against them and said she needs to repent big time. My heart really goes out to these people, because they’re as blind as the Pharisees. They’re hypocrites is all they are. They don’t do what Jesus said, proclaiming to know God their deeds deny Him. And they think they’re not only saved but have the wisdom to discern from one sentence (untethered to doctrine) that a person is unsaved. They think they can quote a proverb at Addy, but a proverb in the mouth of a fool is like legs which are useless to the lame. The message goes on to call Addy “a silly girl, a captive of Babylon walking in the confusion of those who do their own religious thing outside of the cross.” The worst accusations they deliver against Addy even are still yet to come in the post. But the worst accusation of all is also yet to come, and it will be against these men on the last day unless they are born again from above. As it is, I believe they are children of Satin. I wish they knew Ephesians. I wish they knew the words of Christ. Because no one who is born of God continues to sin. And he missed the one criteria that he should have used to determine if Todd White is from God: “Anyone who confesses Jesus has come in the flesh is from God. Anyone who denies that Christ has come in the flesh is not from God.” You call someone “Father” when you do the things that they do. Satan is the accuser. They are full of accusation. Selah. I don’t want to judge someone to not be saved, because with the same measure of judgment you render unto other is will be rendered unto you. So if I say they are not saived because of XY and Z then if I fit into that category Jesus will put me under my own judgement, and that’s not okay.

I Don’t believe that false teachers by and large have an agenda to deceive people and turn them away from the Way. I believe that’s the devil’s agenda, and false teachers are deceived by him.

That’s your choice… if you want to make a bad one.

God took the most intimate relationship two people can share and used it to talk about how we will know Him when we finally see Him just as He is. I tell you just as the ring is only a picture of the marriage bed, so the marriage bed is only a picture of the glories we will have in Christ. It’s so much better. And if we would only see that, nothing would stand in our way.

Do you know? - Tell me

We are all watchman in some sense. We see the sword coming, the coming of Christ. Will you blow the trumpet or let them be taken away in iniquity.

If you don't do it from compassion don't do it at all. Be humble. Don't threaten with hell, warm of it. Don't be like, “I'm blowing my trumpet stupid! Get right!”

I was having a conversation with my little sister and she asked, “Do you really think demons are here?” I said “It's very likely.” I could tell she was terrified, and said, “It's okay, all demons want from you in America is to make you comfortable. They want you to love your food and you're toys and enjoy life.” She said, I thought demons are evil. I said they are. They want you to take you away from what God wants you to do. They want you to do what you want to do instead of what God wants you to do.

By the same standard with which you judge so to shall you be judged. I’m not the administer of this judgement, I’m the reciprocator of it.

It says Solomon did not withhold any pleasure from himself. All the wine he wanted, all the sex. He had 700 wives. If he slept with one per day it would take him two years to get through them. He had more wealth than anybody probably ever had. It says silver was as common as stone. Bill Gates was not up to his level. He climbed higher than any man and said it's all vanity. He went down that road so that we don't have to. Don't think that your pleasures are going to fulfil you.

            In my early years the only girls I knew were from Sunday School. By second grade there were about 10 guys and 1 girl, so she could pretty munch just pick and choose. And I thought that was how it is with every girl. You just line up and “Duck, duck, goose. I want you.” And if you were one of the rejects, learn to make your own sandwich.

David made the mistake of taking a census when God was telling him it’s not about the numbers, it’s about the One who is with you. So now, eisegetical or not, I’m going to learn from his mistake and not make it. I’m not going to look at my number of subscribers and views. It would drive me crazy anyway. All that does is make human praise your water, and you sip it and thirst again. But Jesus is the living water, and if you abide in Him you will never thirst again.

I made the mistake of putting questions where belief used to be. I looked at verses that pretty much say, “This is what a Christian looks like.” Sinless. I was not sinless, so carry over the 1, do the math and I’m not a Christian. But there’s another verse that says whoever believes in Him shall not die but have eternal life, so I do the math there and boom, I have Jesus, because knowing Him is eternal life and I believe on Jesus, so therefore I have eternal life. I don’t know what the sons of thunder meant with all of their glorification-on-earth sounding talk, but this I believe, that Jesus is Lord and God raised Him from the dead on the third day. Praise God! This is my confidence, not my repentance. I don’t know what Hebrews meant when the Writer wrote about Esau’s rejection by God, but what I do know is what Paul meant when he said we are saved by grace through faith, not of works lest any man should boast.

Watching sermons is not righteousness. At best it's the pursuit of righteousness.

Scientists have discovered that in your brain there is no difference between anxiety and excitement. The difference is how you interpret it. Stress is how you're interpreting what's happening to you.

If ever there is a situation where it would be appropriate to edify someone with God’s word, I guarantee you I won’t be doing in the mannerism and voice and tone of these raps. It will be in gentlness and patience giving grace to those who hear. All these raps are for is to get the words drilled into my head. And it’s not for everyone, and some people can’t help but get the tone drilled with it, so don’t listen to them if that’s you. Because God’s word is so pure and holy and amazing and I’d hate to water it down with a pretty font that makes you admire its design more than the God it points to.

Entropy means that energy exists in the form of heat, and heat expands, and when heat expands it becomes cold, and then you can’t use it for anything. So slowly our universe is running out of usable energy and that can serve as a measure of time. But A B-theory of time says that time itself depends of entropy, so that if you were to reverse entropy and put the universe into greater thermodynamic order, time would reverse as well.

When Paul said all scripture is God-breathed or God-inspired, he was not talking about the new testament. That wasn’t a part of the Christians canon until 2 centuries later when the counsel of Hippo declared it canon. If scripture were used to mean or include the New Testament, it would have been pretty foolish for the Bereans to examine what Paul was saying against the scriptures to see if what he was saying was true. “Paul said this, his epistle to the Romans said this. Yep, it pans out.” No, scripture is used to talk about the Jewish Bible, the Tanah. Paul, I believe is inspired of God because God said he would use him as his chosen instrument. As far as the other apostles, I see no reason to read them religiously with the view that they, though being human, were infallible. Sure, I agree, they did not follow clever tales, but were moved along in the Holy Spirit, and we also are today. Or do you not know that the same Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead is in you?

Not with this face. I'm happy with my face, but nevertheless all throughout my life a girl had never looked at me. I don't try to explain it. It doesn't bother me. All attraction is is your body's way of tricking you into reproducing. Everything in nature is set up to make more of itself. The fruit tastes good so that you drop the seed on the ground and another tree starts to grow.

I joke and laugh about it, but it’s not something to be taken lightly. Sexuality is a big, huge, huge, heavy deal to God. It’s not something to be just whatever about, and “Haha.”

“You can't tell but right now deep down I’m petrified.” ~ Agent Burke (White Collar)

“Oh good! Another opinion. Different viewpoints help you become more objective. This is good. And may the best argument win.”

Okay, so I've believed and have faith in Christ, but I'm not being sanctified, which likens me to the fig tree Christ cursed. What do I need to do or believe to have saving faith? Because I already believe, but the promises of fruit is not being fulfilled in my life, so what's left? This isn't mathematically adding up.

If you’re worried that you're going to hell, that's not as bad as the opposite problem. If you’re trembling that you might not be saved, your uncertainty keeps you up at night, that's not as bad as people who are certain they are going to heaven but when Jesus meets them on that final day, it's for the first time, and they hear “Depart from Me, I never knew you.” Probably most people who go to hell (and most people do go to hell) will go to hell shocked. Because the way is narrow, and everybody thinks they are right. Going to hell happens to people who've too easily believed what isn't true. Or too reluctantly lacked believing what is true. The atheist will be shocked his soul lingers on at all. The Muslim will be shocked Jesus really is God’s Son, and God is not at all who he thought He was.

A fish is only free when it's in the water. If the fish feels free to come out onto the land it will die, because it's made for the water. So what is freedom? Freedom is finding the right restrictions, it's not the absence of restrictions. (Tim Keller reading Charles Hummel)

“did you miss me?” in a way likened to the money one would send to missions. You don't miss it because you recognize this is the will of God.

I got some killer theology from a rapper you might have heard of called KB. It’s a song called, “Heart Song,” and in it there’s a girl that needs a heart transplant because hers is messed up. “Someone has to die with a good heart, then we’ll exchange it.” Because if you put another messed up heart in her chest it’s not going to allow her to live. It’ll maybe give her a little longer, put it’s going to stop beating soon too. You see, the blood of goats and bulls and rams could never wipe away the sins of you and I because they weren’t pure enough. The sin of the world is really messed up. We all need a heart doner, and there’s only one heart that’s never going to stop beating, and Jesus came down from heaven to give it to you.

When you sin unintentionally, and you are accused of it, do not draw attention to your ignorance to show yourself blameless, but repent. You finished the milk not realizing we didn't have more, and your sister accuses you and you say, “Oh was that the last of the milk?” and she says, “Faith purposely did not drink that last night so that she could have it for breakfast.” You don't say, “Oh I didn't know.” Or when you say that and she says, “You were sitting right there when this happened,” you don't say, “I didn't hear anything about it.” You repent. “Oh. Oops. Sorry.” If you can drive maybe you offer to go pick up some more. When she brings it up later, you say it again. “Yeah, sorry, I feel bad about that.”

People roll their eyes at the things that sear my conscience, thinking that there’s such a big difference between that and say adultery. And there is a big difference between that and adultery, but it's not so large that it separates me from you.

Paul makes a distinction between the spirit and the mind (or soul) in 1 Cor. 14:14-16. We often mis-identify spiritual gifts with gifts of the mind, or natural gifts we have. But spiritual gifts are those he lists in chapter 12.

You’re wearing pants today. Why? Because you chose to. Now probably you did not sit down this morning and have a debate in your head about whether you should wear pants or not wear pants. You automatically made that decision because the way you think. You were not born into this world with that way of thinking. You learned it. Choices are not a one-time thing, and once you choose to be a runner you are one. Choices result from the way you think. If you want to be successful at anything, you start the way you think.

I got a 20 out of 20 on the emotional intelligence test. People think that I’m not compassionate, but that’s not the case. Is he I have compassion and I can empathize with you, but I’m not going to sit there and stroke your feelings for you to be okay. Remember Joshua? Someone from Israel Get It Bad Thing his name was Aiken come and Joshua fell on his face weeping before the Lord just repenting from it period and God did not say oh it’s okay I forgive you, just try and do better in the future. He said get up! Exclamation mark. Get up and make it right. Dang! So many people are like oh Psalm 51 God wants us to have a contrite heart and just be broken all the time. No, God says arise this is your responsibility. Be strong and courageous!  Gird up your loins like a man! Can a man give birth like a woman? Then why do I see every man with his hands on his loins and a pale face? We’re not supposed to be wallowing in our sin on our face our whole lives. God wants us to get up and fight.

People who notice inconsistencies between what you say and what you do are tolling to live with. You can do things for their benefit because of something they haven't even said left. That's no way to live. Just be free.

I hate people commenting on changes in my hair or fashion. “It looks good.” I don't like people working out in their minds that I have improved somehow from a previous state of existence. They look at you strangely. I don't act charismatically with people who have context of who I am. They know everything about me, they have me profiled already, and if I behave in a way that’s inconsistent with that characterization they ask questions or make curious observations. “You’re looking joyful today.” Something in my psychology does not like that. But when I'm making a first impression, I am entirely out of character from my old way if behaving. I need to escape my family to become me. And when I do, I am me and I feel good. But in context it’s a slow movement of progression. I think maybe when I was younger it was hardwired in my brain by the way I psychoanalyzed everything that it wasn’t cool to care about things, and therefore if someone noticed I changed my hair they might think I cared. Looking after yourself was “girly,” so I had to be apathetic. And now, years later, that same thought-process is seared into my subconscious so that I act according to that nature without knowing why.

Paul said take every thought captive, make no provision for the flesh. I think we have a tendency to make a covenant with our thoughts so to speak, the covenant of Gibeon. It comes into our mind and we let it live there, and it becomes a snare to us. God wants it out, He wants it dead. When He says kill and Israel doesn’t kill, they get oppressed by it every time.

If you want to get married sometime in the future, Bethany, you won’t ask me that question. If you really want to know why I am not taking a helper unto myself, God can impart unto you the knowledge which he imparted unto me, but you will never look at a man the same way again. Choose now. Before you is marriage in ignorance, or the ministry of Paul with the knowledge of the hidden things of marriage. What is your choice?

Ziemlich Beste Freunde- HipHop Remix by Mariobeatz – When I would sit outside and pray the night away. When I would write on YouTube to defend Your name. When I was working out, singing TobyMac’s song, “Undeniable,” So thankful that it was true. Do You remember that? Do you remember when we were close? Do you remember when I sat outside on the porch and as I was praying I was a vision of a face in front of me and it dawned on me that I was praying to God, and my tongue became tied and I couldn’t say anything at all. Or is everything I’ve been through with you a delusion? I don’t want to get to the end of my life and hear those words, “I never knew you.” And I say, “But God, remember?” “But no. That wasn’t Me. Every time you rolled Your eyes up to heaven because someone said something stupid, I never smiled at you the way you thought.” I can’t hear those words. I can’t be like Job. I have to know You, I have to see You. Open my eyes and the curtains of the window of the Bible so that I can see the God it points to on the other side.

_Obergefell v. Hodges_ denied prurient interests, an appeal to a morbid, degrading and unhealthy interest in sex, as distinguished from a mere candid interest in sex.

I will not get married for the same reason that I do not watch TV. Relationships take time. A lot of time. So much time. The world doesn’t have time. The world is perishing. Even just friendships take time to sustain. You have to keep in touch on Facebook and texting and write messages apply time to think about what to say things to do together comma and fuse common interests and goals.

When friends ask you to do something, you normally say yes and get excited, right? That’s because it’s an opportunity to create another memory. With family, you live with them. You already have more memories than you can remember.

_Nobody should be so important to you that you have to win their admiration to feel good about yourself._

Genetic engineers more or less think that their smarter than natural selection. If you look at evolution, genetics automatically modify themselves. When you talk about GMO, everything is GMO, the difference is whether God / nature / whatever you want to call natural selection or intelligent humans modified it. We can make mistakes, true, but GMO doesn’t automatically mean bad.

Do I believe in evolution? I believe in the evolution that happens. – within geni, yes. I don’t believe apes and humans share a common ancestor. That appears to be nonsensical.

I’m not saying this to say you should expect to fail and sin your whole life. I’m saying this to say don’t wait for some giant epiphany to live righteously and godly. Victory is in your hands right now; you are a conqueror. Satan can’t shut you down. Now live like it. Claim the power of the name you proclaim. Don’t back off. Look at yourself as beast. We’re going to crush hell today. I really don’t even see myself as capable of being overcome. You can’t penetrate this armor. It’s from Christ. If it was mine you could get through, but it’s His. See yourself right now as impossible to crush.

Sit at a gate and wait for a passer-byer and say, “Turn aside,  friend, sit down here.”

The old patriarch Enoch wrote, “Contemplate all the events in the sky; how the lights in the sky do not change their courses, how each rises and sets in order, each at its proper time, and they do not transgress their law.” He goes on to point out that though the stars are mightier than mankind, they obey the laws God has set for them, while we are not bound by such constraints (i.e. we have freewill and should choose to obey).

Steven Anderson would say that if a Christian is homosexual they are lying about their beief in Jesus. He says the same thing about people who can understand the NIV translation of the Bible but can’t understand the KJV version of the Bible. That is fundamentally the same line of reasoning that lordship salvation tries to make period lordship salvation attempts to dismiss somebody is Christianity on the basis of an inconsistency with how they are living and what the bible promises in new believers.

If anyone has come to faced by reading the NIV translation of the Bible, in the Holy Spirit must be speaking through those words. Jesus the spirit they will not be forgiven. Pastor Anderson says the nive is the devil that is to say that the devil is speaking in the NIV translation and not the Holy Spirit. Which is in its Essence blaspheming the Holy Spirit. That’s a dangerous game. But everything else Pastor Anderson says cold water in the Bible so I can’t believe that he is about the base tomorrow, which is the only reason that I think he may perhaps be correct in his statements and why I should not follow the good wisdom of James White who makes perfect sense to me even when Pastor Anderson appeals less to my reasoning. If you say the devil is behind this book, not the Holy Spirit, when in fact the Holy Spirit actually is behind this book then you’re blaspheming the Holy Spirit. The test to see whether or not the holy spirit is behind this book is if someone can be saved by reading it. Because faith comes by hearing and hearing the word of Christ so if they get Faith by hearing the NIV than the NIV is the word of Christ not the word of the devil and that is what validates it.

My inner critic is louder than my inner child.

Who permitted you to speak, woman? If she will not repent and I will take it before the church and if they do not rebuke her and tell her out and lack of repentance, then the church is not then you do not judge righteously and Discerning God’s will for you yourself have said that it will of God is never contrary to the word of God

When it comes to the KJOests, there’s part of me that wants to say to it’s critics, “Don’t eat food sacrificed to idols if it causes your brothers to stumble.” You know its okay, and I know its okay, but Steven Anderson doesn’t, so don’t be arrogant and cause him to stumble in his conscience. But then there’s another part of me that wants to say, “Whoever blasphemes the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven.” God speaks through the Bible. Every time Hebrews quotes the OT the Writer says, “The Spirit is speaking.” And then there’s the whole God-breathed thing. So when somebody looks at words God is saying and says, “It’s the devil speaking!” They do exactly what the pharasees did to Jesus before he said the above quote about blaspheming the Holy Spirit. “He cast out demons by Beelzebub!” I think proponants of both sides of the argument need to be careful.

The word critical is derived from the Greek word kritikos, which means discernment.

Your prayers only work 30 percent of the time. Even straight up hope is enough to account for that.

I was reading about king Saul in 1 Samuel today, and two times it makes note that Saul was rejected by God. God told Saul to kill king Agog, but he took him prisoner. He told him to kill and destroy all the plunder, but they took what was valuable. So it says that Saul rejected God’s command, and God rejected Saul. Samuel was grieving for Saul after that. You see, a lot of us grieve for unbelievers and all the people who are going to hell. We listen to the books that paint this image of God being ever-so-compassionate and sorry for the people he sends to hell. “He let me feel a glimpse of the pain He feels for those going to hell, and I couldn’t take it.” But God looked at Samuel and Said, “Why are you grieving for Saul? For I have rejected him.” When I read that, I thought, “That’s exactly what He says in Jeremiah 16: do not enter a house of mourning for them.” Yet today we feel obligated to mourn for 50 dead homosexuals who got shot up at a bar. Romans 1 says that the reason a person is homosexual is because God has given them up to a debased mind. He has rejected them. And yet we mourn for the rejected of God. And I strongly do not believe God feels pain for the people He throws in hell. His wrath is satisfied by it. It says God desired to but Onan’s brother to death. He may not be everything the church has made him out to be; He’s much greater.

People depart from the faith because they were not of us. It morphs into an intellectual problem, but that only results from what’s called a cinfimation bias, where you only look at the evidence that supports your worldview and dismiss the evidence against it.  But it starts out when kids start reading the Bible for themselves and they see a mismatch between everything it says and everything the church does and teaches. These are the same questions I had when I was against the church is 2013. Ultimately, nobody leaves because of hypocrisy in the church. They went out with us, but they were not of us, for if they were of us, they would have remained with us. That’s the underlying reason people leave the church. You can’t blame it on bad teaching or bad strategies or inconsistencies. I remember when I first opened my Bible, I got really excited when I was reading a passage that I learned about in Sunday School, but 2 out of 3 times it meant something entirely different than what my Sunday School teacher used it to support. I can remember one time that a passage meant something exactly opposite of what my teacher had taught me, and at that point I lost it. My trust in the church completely crashed because it didn’t align with the Bible. And that’s what starts kids off the road your put them on. It starts with an emotional problem of seeing a mismatch between the Bible and the Church, and then it morphs into an intellectual problem because we want to be objective about it and reasonable, so we selectively collect evidence with a confirmation bias, and at that point it’s almost impossible to talk us out of it, because we’ve prepared for every argument under the sun. Even if you beat us, our faith in your faithlessness is unshakable. We resort to ad hominins because that’s the easiest way to argue with you. But we also gather good arguments, too. For me, it started with these kinds of things. The Bible says women shouldn’t speak in church. I haven’t found a church yet that follows the Bible on that one. Paul says for women to cover their heads in worship. It’s very rare for a church to do that. The Bible says go out into all the world and preach the gospel. Jesus said, follow me and I will make you fishers of men. I personally knew very few people growing up who exercised a faith that even resembled that commandment. The Bible says don’t mourn for reprobates, but we do. Jesus said there’s no excuse for divorce except sexual immorality, but the church is rampage with divorce. The church says, “Don’t hate,” but God’s hatred makes it clear that you can’t love the flowers without hating the weeds. I have 21 verses about the hatred of God. Kids disrespect their parents. Paul said let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth but for edification, giving grace, but we gossip and slander each other. The Bible says not to have fellowship with brothers-so-called who are living in sin, and they should be thrown out of the church, but we welcome them with open arms. The Bible says to confront sin in a brother privately, then with two friends, then before the church, then treat them as a pagan, but we say, “Don’t judge.” Yet we do judge, but not with right judgement. We judge with partiality (James), based on professions and what people are worth to us, but we don’t judge people for their sin. The Bible says the marriage bed should be elevated, but we lump all sex into one big pile of taboo. The Bible says to instruct your kids when you rise, when you walk by the way, when you sit, and when you lay down, but most families are doing well just to read a devotional and disperse once a night. The Bible says believers will lay their hands on the sick and the sick will recover, but we pray “for the hands of the doctors,” and 70% of the people we pray for die anyway. We’re like king Asa who trusted the physicians. The Bible says to greet each other with psalms and hymns and praises to God, but we say, “What’s up?” and then start complaining. The Bible says those who believe will have spiritual gifts, prophesying and words of knowledge and miracles, but we put our natural talents and interests in place of them and bring no fruit to fruition. The Bible says be wise with your time, redeeming it because the days are evil, but we watch TV and talk about trivial and dark things. The Bible says have nothing to do with the disgraceful deeds of darkness, but even expose them, yet we not only do them but give approval to those who practice them. The Bible says don’t lust, but 70% of the kids in youth group are hooked on pornography, and so are the adults. The Bible says only few should be teachers, but we appoint teachers left and right, whoever is willing, even if their doctrine is heresy. The Bible says exhort in doctrine, but we say, “To each his own interpretation.” The church sings, “I’ll stand, with arms high and heart abandoned,” at the very moment that their hands are at their sides or crossed. If they lied about the first part, which is easy, they probably lied about the last part, which is hard. The Bible says don’t live for today, kingdom first, put you mind on things above, but we’re worried about retirement. The Bible condemns casual living, eating drinking, building, trading, buying and selling type lifestyles, but that’s the norm. The Bible says God’s church should not be a house of merchandise, but every church that’s big enough sells books, sometimes even coffee and lunch. The Bible says make no image resembling anything under the earth, but we play with dolls in the children’s ministry. There comes a point that you back up and say, “Good grief, does the church do anything Jesus commanded?” “How can you call Him Lord when you don’t do what He says?” But without taking the time to ask why I’m forsaking the church, or even to listen to me when I try to speak, you say, “The Bible says don’t forsake the assembly,” to which my heart echoes the words of Micah 2, “I wish someone would close the gates of your assembly!” Parents just dismiss everything a child is going through in their time with the Bible, they don’t listen to us, and they expect us to do what the Bible says while they themselves aren’t living up to it or even trying to because they don’t know what’s in it. They’ve been indoctrinated, and we’re finally started to have questions, but you either don’t have the answers or don’t even hear us because we don’t have time between you quoting one isolated verse in Hebrews and telling us to go to church. “A stranger’s voice they will not follow.” And when they finally hear the voice of God in the Bible, no voice sounds more foreign than the words of the church. We realize you were just using church to indoctrinate us with, “Don’t lie, don’t steal,” blah, blah, blah. And yet we read that God told Samuel to deceive Saul when he went to anoint a new king. We even read that God Himself sent a Spirit to deceive 400 prophets against Elijah. Isaiah was sent to plug up the ears to 90% of Israel so that having eyes they would not see, and having ears they would not hear.” We just flippantly put in in a song, “It’s never okay to lie.” Nothing matches up, everything you told us was a lie, and we don’t trust you anymore. This is why you’re losing the youth.

“Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.”

You never approach an issue with the presupposition that its false. If it is false, you can afford to give it a fair consideration. I do with atheism, it’d be a shame if you didn’t share my objectivity.

God, there’s Ray Comfort, there’s Steven Anderson, there’s Todd White, and there’s the Gospel Coalition. They call each other false prophets, and they all fall on the Bible. I don’t know who is right, and I don’t know what is true. And there is also Lawrence Krauss. There are many teachers, but only one truth. Holy Spirit, be my Teacher, lest I come to believe the schemes of the evil one.

What if I can't understand Greek? It’s the shepherd’s voice. If I don't recognize it, it’s not because I'm not his sheep, it’s because those are words I don't understand. It sounds like a stranger’s voice to me because I speak English. What Anderson needs to realize is that God has spoken through many portions and in many ways. Whether it be the ESV, the NIV, the KJV, or whatever. My dad got saved reading the NIV. I do not believe anyone can be saved but by the word of God. You do the math.

I pulled out my phone to read the KJV for the first time while I was washing myself from a seminal emission, I was taking a bath. And at first I was thinking, “What in the world am I reading? This is worded so strangely.” But I pushed through it, and in only a few verses I started to understand it, and there was a glory in the words that wasn’t there for the NIV, the NASB. There was a weight in the words that I was experiencing for the first time. It was like my whole life I had been hearing echoes of the Word of God, and for the first time I was hearing the source, and it was clear, and amazing. All the other versions were open to interpretation in almost every verse, but the KJV was clear, which is something I had been taught to shy away from, because we can interpret it wrongly. But there just wasn’t room for that in the KJV. When I was reading it, it felt like there was a radiance emanating from the words likened to the radiance of the sun when you walk outside. Even if you close your eyes you can feel the radiance of the sun, and from this book I could feel the radiance of the glory of God. There is power in His word. That being said, I do have some intellectual problems with KJV onlyism that I’d like to sort out before advocating its arguments. God says come let us reason together, so I don’t want to neglect the command to use our logic, wearily.

It does absolutely no good for a man to incline his belief’s toward an untruth. As Pascal put it, “People almost invariably arrive at their beliefs not on the basis of proof but on the basis of what they find attractive.” Extremely intelligent people are often wrong not because they are stupid, but because they are intelligent enough to deceive themselves and make a falsehood appear reality.

You don’t marry for love. Love isn’t the end of a relationship, it’s the means of a relationship. You don’t choose someone because you have found love to already exist there. You find someone and choose to make love exist there. You choose to treat them and think about them in such a way that your inner self is drawn to them. And you can choose your thoughts, I know that’s not a popular idea, but Paul said take your thoughts captive.

Christianity isn't a hearsay. You don't just hear it and then say it.  If you haven't personally encountered the risen Savior, you are not qualified to testify that He has risen.

Thanks you – ah man, you don't need to thank me, we just thank Jesus. Give me your hand.

Brandon, the baby is much farther along in the process of mitosis than a zygote by the time anyone can identify they are pregnant. In 24 hours the zygote splits in to two cells. In 12 hours after that it splits into 4. By the time it reaches 64 cells you have everything that constitutes life, including unalienable rights. Especially the right to life. It would be hypocritical for me to advocate pro-life agendas, because in my heart I really don't care about these millions of children that are being murdered. It doesn't affect me in any way, and I'm somewhat unsympathetic to it. But you should know that your science is wrong. I don't care that many people die. I didn’t know them. 50000 people died today and I didn't shed a tear, but that didn't mean I've abandoned my sense of injustice.

When I had no Bible reading plan, just reading Genesis to Revolation, I read at a much faster pace than once per year. I tried the Discipleship Reading Plan twice, and both times it took me at least a year and a half to get through it, and I didn’t remember most of what I read. There’s something about squeezing spirituality into a time slot that doesn’t work. I had intended my Bible reading to be merely a foundation for the rest of the day. But for me, being in four places in one sitting disorients my attention and I lose it all. Where as if I’m reading through one narrative, it sticks a lot better and makes more sense. I also reference other passages and connect the dots, ironically, easier. For these reasons I do not believe I will continue using Bible reading plans, but just plan when to read and go all the way through. God can be found in all of it. Don’t feel pressured to get a little bit of gospel every day. I can read through mark in one day, or four months. I’ll take the one day. It’s a lot easier and more efficient. I’m not halting the Holy Spirit every 10 verses.

Just because someone doesn’t change their mind about an issue doesn’t mean they have confirmation bias. That would be silly to say. As we get older, many of us go through a “rebel” stage that we actually have the opposite problem. We look for evidence that opposes the belifs we were raised with and ignore evidence that confirms it.

Evidence is a tricky thing. Every time a shooting happens, people in favor of gun control interpret it in a way that supports their existing beliefs, while those who oppose gun control interpret it in a way that supports their current point of view.

Most religions begin because a people decide together who God is (the gods are not angry, Rob Bell). They set up gods and worship them. But the way that Christianity came about is not like any other religion. Because of the way Christianity began, it is not feasible that it could have survived if Jesus did not appear in the flesh. Even one of his own disciples was recorded as saying, as we would expect, “Unless I touch his hands, I will not believe.” Tommas not only, believed, but gave up his life after Jesus appeared to him. Jesus appeared to more than 500 brethren after he had been crucified. Now under normal circumstances you might expect a religion to just materialize out of nothing spectacular. But Christianity faced major persecution at its beginning. Their leader, Jesus, died, and persecution came to all his followers soon afterward. The Jews hunted Christians. Unless they really believed he was the Son of God, unless they had seen him with their own eyes, as Thomas said, there is every reason that Christianity should have dissipated right at its beginning, but it didn’t; it exploded. What started out as 500 men came to be more than 2 billion in 2,000 years. That’s an average of about 3,000 converts a day. “Hey, come be persecuted! Come die with us!” There’s no explination for the religion of Christianity except that Jesus really did rise from the dead.

I've been coming across a lot of atheists reveling in the fact that they don't make a positive assertion that God doesn't exist, but rather are skeptical that he does, therefore shifting the burden of proof on the theist because it's whoever makes a knowledge claim that bears the burden. This is silly. They also gloat that it is dishonest to say anything other than “I don't know.” Science doesn't stop at idk, it makes claims and then tries to falsify them. There’s nothing wrong with making claims. That's how science works. You operate on the basis of, “we'll discover the answer sometime in the future.” How convenient. It isn't logical to base your beliefs on what you don't know or what you think humanity will find out after your long dead. “I'm just not going to eat because in another 50 years we’ll discover that we actually don't need to.” Bad analogy, but you get the point.

“There's no reason for them to be like that.” Where do you draw the line between homosexuality and hate? Where do you get your morals? You just make them up as it suits you? Because we say the same thing about Sodomites. There's no reason for then to be like that. They are haters of God.

In Hebrews 10 the writer quotes a passage from numbers that’s making a distinction between a sin and ignorance and willful sin so he’s paralleling the sins of propane to Mosaic bar and being punished under the testimony of two or three Witnesses with the sin of trampling underfoot the son of God and despising His grace. Which also carries the parallel of a physical death versus a spiritual death. So when he says sinning willfully, that means you no longer have the excuse of ignorance. You have heard the Gospel of Jesus Christ and at that point either you rejected or you accept it, but you cannot plead ignorance.

To paraphrase Paul in 1 Corinthians 7, “Ain’t nobody got time for that!”

“That's not natural” sounds like bigotry, but I don't think it is. It's caning out the misuse of something that was designed for a bigger purpose. That's not what it’s for. God didn't make sex for your twisted pleasures, He made it to glorify Himself and to make babies. But all the reasons behind this logic are inferred. And that same logic is overturned by the Bible. What are breasts for? The most natural thing in the world is for a baby to be comforted by his mother’s breasts, they are for feeding babies. And yet Solomon repeatedly says things like, “May you be satisfied in her breasts. Your stature is like a palm and you breasts its clusters. I will climb up the tree and lay hold of the fruit.” Wait a minute Solomon, that's not what it’s for. Well, maybe using something God designed for another purpose isn't always a bad thing. Podcast 400, ask pastor John.

If you gather two people, one from a pastor in this land and another from a pastor in that land, their doctrines may very likely be different. But if you give someone the Bible in this land and another person the Bible in that land and you gather them together, and they really read it and believe it, they will probably have the same beliefs. There are many preachers, but there is only one Teacher. Don't put your pastor in the place of the Holy Spirit. I know it's cool to have all the names memorized for doctrines, but draw it out of your reading of the Bible first. “The doctrine of impitation.” that's great, but don't let it sidetrack you from the Bible as a whole. Just read what it says and don't worry about all these names.

Working for less than minimum wage is legal, it’s just not legally enforceable. The contract would be in pari delicto.

As jobs move to being replaced by machines, fewer people are going to need jobs for goods and services to be produced, and then government can be allowed to provide its citizens with a desent quality of life without destroying the economy due to lack of incentive to work. The problem is that there are jobs that are irreplaceable. We will always need experts. We will always need engineers and capital justice and all manner of people. But low-skill workers will be replaced because they can be replaced. So what do you do with undeeded members of society when the only jobs available are for experts? The government will need to provide for them. But then you have the same problem of “Why should I work then?”

1 Cor 7 only makes sense of there’s something wrong with burning passion and its sequent behavior.

Banning free speech because people have become very mean is the same as saying I want slavery back because there’s so much racism today. I just can’t cope with this logic.

I heard a feminist arguing recently about the differences between boys and girls on self-reflectiveness, saying that girls are more sensitive than boys in general and therefore should be treated accordingly. So she is not advocating for a gender equality, she recognizes a difference between the two genders and says hey they should be treated in conjunction to those differences.

I have observed recently that I do not do well in debates. I do not think on the spot. I write things out to learn what I think, and then I can talk about it. Not the other way around. So, if I haven’t previously thought about an idea that someone is going to present in an argument, I’m probably not going to do a very good job of it if you need it. It takes me a little while to consider what the other person is saying, because I don’t automatically rule it out and then just say you’re wrong.

I don’t ever impose doctrines on the Bible, I just look at it in light of other passages.

I wouldn’t use the them pronouns, and here’s why. I’m going to need a couple of minutes to explain, can you let me talk until I’m done? God created him or her fearfully and wonderfully. At the moment a person decides he is a girl, despite his genitalia, his X/Y chromosomes, his production of hormones like testosterone and vasopressin, the male dignity that you were created with, and this is the part you won’t resonate with but the most important one for me, the responsibility of bearing the side of the image of God that is represented by the character of men, not women, at that point you have decided that who you are, your created value and dignity and purpose that God has created with isn’t enough and you need to be something different to be wonderful. That’s a lie. Because I believe that you were wonderfully and fearfully made, and when you step away from that truth you say to God, “You made a mistake. I’m not going to be who you created me to be. You made me worthless, and I’m going to fix what you messed up.” It’s not true that you’re a woman. You say, “I have the mind of a woman.” What makes you a woman? Thinking like a woman? (Added pronouns to a dictionary doesn’t mean anything. The truth can’t be amended). For thousands of years people could know whether you’re a boy or a girl the minute you were born. That’s all going out the window, and it’s stupid. I don’t support the need for someone to have to lie to themselves for them to be okay. (People commit suicide for being called a certain pronoun. People commit suicide for murdering their spouse as well. Doesn’t mean we should pass legislation to lie to them and say, “Oh you actually did kill your wife, but you’ll commit suicide if you believe that, so we’ll say you didn’t.” That’s not an argument. If someone’s name is Collin, and he wants me to call him Brett, but I won’t because that’s not his name, it’s very much not my fault for his committing suicide. He could just not respond to Collin.)

Are you seriously going to give any credence to that?

The notion that “They can’t deny my testimony,” is absolutely absurd. You can stop the argument by saying, “Well he did this in my life,” but that isn’t a particularly useful way of having a conversation because you’re making yourself the final arbiter of truth, meaning no matter what they say you won’t listen to them. “But they can’t deny it!” Of course they can. The definition of anecdotal evidence is “not necessarily true or reliable, because based on personal accounts rather than facts or research.” You can shut them up doing that, but it isn’t going to persuade them you’re right. Mormons talk about their experiences with God with more tears than protestants. Please, please, please do not use your testimony as an argument that Jesus is true. It isn’t useful, it isn’t effective, it makes Christians look like people who base their beliefs on subjective internal experiences that you attribute to God without reason, and most importantly, faith comes by hearing and hearing the words of Christ, not the testimony of Christians. If “faith” comes by something other than the words of Christ, they can be talked out of it because they were talked into it. That’s not how it works. You sow the seed of the gospel and those who receive it get saved, and those who don’t are rejected by God because they rejected Him. It’s that simple. And we’re not to enter a house of morning for those rejected by God (Jeremiah 16), so don’t complicate things with your evangelistic strategies. It’s the word of God that gets people saved, and the surgery of the Holy Spirit taking out their heart of stone and putting in a heart of flesh. There’s no other way.

Today we’re going to be talking about this phrase Christians sometimes use, “Hate the sin, love the sinner.” We’re all familiar with it, right? How many of us have read that in the Bible? Oh, trick question, it’s not in the Bible. Anywhere. It’s actually a part of Hinduism propounded by Gandhi. First, we have to separate this idea that love and hate are polar to one another. That's actually not true, love and hate can coexist. Indifference is the opposite of them both. Psalm 5:5 and 11:5 says that God hates the workers of iniquity.

A brother whose stuck in sin is not supposed to be associated with the brethren therefore if you tell someone they need to go to church, even if they are stuck in sin, that's actually not biblical. He isn’t supposed to leaven the whole lump of dough. Therefore for a little while, until I conquer this sin, it is my duty to not go to church, lest a little bit of leaven leavens the whole lump of dough.

You have to let each other respond point-by-point if you’re going to do conversation in a rationale way.

Tell me you’ve never contemplated the idea that being dead would be better than living. In the end, something anchored you to the earth. I'm not sure I would have that. Fear, love, goals.

One of these days I am going to write a chronology of everything that I thoughts would help me stop PMO and give the different strategies names and learn them all to remember them at the same time. “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God”, the rest of Project Blink, 7 step approach, God’s punishment, reboot nation, NoFap, sight fast, NoEtbownen, getting so in love with God it just distracts you and sin loses its appeal. Literally hundrends of things have crossed my minds and hands, and some were partially effective. Fasting from phone, putting Chrome under start instead of on start menu. I’m going to collate everything into one document and simplify it.

Laws are not enforced by how they were intended, but how the reasonable person would interpret it. Would a fly on the wall that reads the law know what it meant? That’s the issue. So just because an officer chooses to enforce an ambiguous law with definite certainty of what’s meant by it, it by no means confirms that it was the right decision.

What kind of useless rhetoric is this? It’s like legalese, you’re not trying to help people understand a thought, you’re trying to mask it behind vocabulary. It takes you 200 words to say what an average person could say in 50. That’s not an efficient use of language. Cut down the word count. Say as much as you can with as few words as possible. If you need that many words to say something of substance, you may have vocabulary, but you don’t understand good linguistics.

The true test of learning the Bible is not how well you can quote it, but how it changes your behavior. I don’t need to remember every jot and tittle in Ephesians 4 and 5 for it to change my life in drastic measures. The words produce a heart change, and perspective change, so that when you forget the words, you don’t forget your perspective. Hearts do not change from loss of memory; they change from words. When your mind forgets the words, your heart retains them.

There’s too many words! There’s too many documents! I will never get ahead of my own thoughts. Written for a time never to be read again. No eye can perceive the abundance words my heart has put forth, let alone all the wisdom of knowledge of men. The wise King was right in his counsel, the king who said, “To the writing of books there is no end. When will this message mean more to me than it does now? It never will. I won’t remember what I mean by it. The world doesn’t need more thoughts; it needs to organize the ones we have. It is a task too great for the world. John Piper and DesiringGod has done an amazing Job, and even I do not use it all. I want to make videos, and I want them to be structured with the best theology and motivation the word has to offer. The sweetest honey will touch the lips of my mouth, and the sweetest song the ears of those who hear. What should I remember and what should I forget? What should I return to and what should I cast behind me? This is the struggle. I’m tired of putting my thoughts into categories. Where will this one go? Sometimes thoughts are unique, there’s no place for them. I wrote down all my prayers, but when did I learn them? When did I return to my work? For as soon as I was finished transcribing them I closed the book never to open it again. I have prayers today, why pray my thoughts which came out of me yesterday? There is no end. All rivers flow into the sea, yet the sea is never full. When will I learn which to discriminate between my ideas, which ones are valuable and which ones are worthless? I will waste my time reading this in the coming years. Either that, or I have wasted my time writing this at the present moment. 270 pages long, and there is no time to read all of it. When I began it was a mere few pages. It grew, and evolved, and increased, and not it is too great to be useful. All of my work is awash because the heap of it has become too numerous to ponder. My thoughts, obsolete because they are a needle in a haystack of needles. At length the man perceives it die away and fade into the light of common day. My gold has become petty because it is as common as stones. My words are so much more precious than a rare jewel, for words are life and consciousness, they spring only from the mind of a spirit given life by the breath of God, yet I would trade many words for a worthless stone to hang around my neck. For my words are in great supply, and are excessive. I do not know what to do with them all. I will begin, and one day, I will start a new document. My journal will be the place for my thoughts, and what is valuable will go to a higher place, a book of video ideas. And when it is organized and structured, then I will share it and feed a world that is already bursting at the seams. My mind is used up and worn out. It no longer functions the way it used to. Nothing is wise to me anymore, just as the cucumber becomes odious when you’ve tasted the grape. My words are long and drawn out and in the end say nothing, while they used to be short and concise and would say what many books could not. I’m tired. I want to be impressed again. I want to be excited about something new. I have ceased learning, for my behavior has ceased to change.

Sara, you are in the unique situation where death becomes tangible and real and close. And when it hits you that you won’t live forever you start to get perspective one things, and you have a close view of passing on from this mortal coil of ours. You start to think about what happens after you pass on. Heaven, hell, God, these are questions the Bible says are set in the minds of men. I want to ask you, are you ready? Or are there things that you want to sort out before you go? Because eternity is something very heavy. It’s not something to gamble away. Where do you think you’ll go?

If CO2 could be shown to be a contributing factor in climate change, then you would be able to make predictions about how it will affect future climate conditions. As it stands the ipcc can make no predictions whatsoever, and as it stands no credible evidence has been shown to link climate change with CO2 emissions Buy man made in the industrial revolution Aries. It is also worth mentioning that no one among the members of the ipcc have even asserted that the burning of fossil fuels leads to catastrophe.

After I graduate this semester I will get a job at Target or Fries or the the like. One reason is so that I can focus mandatory efforts on trading option derivatives. The underlying reason for college and education is to get money, but I do not need to follow traditional methods to achieve that. I won’t be roped into these things. But I WILL learn to evangalise, or else I’ve abandoned network marketing for nothing. I can’t afford to appear as though I have an agenda that’s rooted in the things Jesus told us to give up for his Kingdom. If I meet someone, I need to present Kingdom first, not business first, and I am not comfortable devolving from Kingdom to business, lest they come to be suspicious of me and God alike. This isn’t a Christian rule or even a rule of mine for all people; it is a rule of mine for me. Kingdom first and Kingdom in its purity without distraction. I can make money another way, and if not I’ll finally depend on my Father for my daily bread, and I will become even more zealous. (Suli Breaks, Prince EA, boyinaband, Propaganda, thinkorswim)

There are 3 major inhibitors of the accuracy of anecdotal evidence aside from misrepresentation: Encoding failure, storage decay, and retrival failure (Learning Framework, 305). Because of issue such as reconstruction error and how the brain recalls information, memory can often be incomplete and potentially innacurate, therefore unreliable.

The entire basis of our ability to process the world around us depends on our ability to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant sensory memory which then gets stores in working memory, and finally long-term memory. Our mind would get so bogged down it would not be able to function properly if it were not for this very crucial skill. Our forgetfulness is the basis of our everyday life. We would scarcely be able to put one foot in front of the other were it not for our forgetting 99.9% of the sensory memory that is constantly being interpreted by our brains (297-304).

Explicit vs. implicit knowledge (302, LF). Memorizing the Bible versus having an understanding of it that shapes the way you make decisions even if you can’t recall the specific information or wording. I call implicit knowledge working on your nature.

The Lord rebuke you, Dean! How could you, a man of God, do such a wicked thing? I say to you, it will be for you as it was for Balaam the son of Beor unless you repent.

I was just talking with my mom, trying to figure out a word or theory in psychology that describes a particular scenario where you try to do something gracious for someone else, and it ends up causing problems for them. For example, there’s a movie in the Love Comes Softly series where a little girl is helping care for the sick in her town. Then a doctor comes along and chews her out for spreading germs by using the same spoon to feed them with, something that she couldn’t have been expected to know in that day and age. So all of the work, service, and toil she has personally expended out of good-will has actually harmed the people. That has got to be a terrible feeling. Imagine if you ask her why she’s helping these folks. She isn’t being paid for it, she’s just trying to make a difference and give something to the world. And then someone says that her contributions to the world are a detriment. That’s got to suck. But it happens. I thought of it because this morning (11/7/16) I was reading in my Bible about Elisha and his servant in the company of some prophets. Now there was a drought, but Elisha sent someone to go gather some herbs to make a large pot of stew for all the prophets. Since there is a famine, you can’t be picky with your herbs, you just gather what you can, and it turns out this particular servant ends up gathering poisonous herbs, but nobody knows what it is, so they make stew out of it. Well, when the people eat it, they all get sick and say, “There’s death in the pot.” And it reminded me of this “try to do good, end up doing bad” scenario. Mom had thought I was just talking about that the other day, something that I had experienced of that nature, which perplexed me because nothing came to mind. To make my case, I asserted, “I don’t really do things for people for that reason.” She said, “Yeah, because of something that you experienced as a child,” trying to recall what I might have said to her the other day. “No,” I replied, “More from just observing other people. Like a big, giant present that someone pays lots of money for and it ends up we don’t even want it,” pointing out a crock-pot we verbally despised after the giftor had left, and implying on other generous things this person had given us that we didn’t want. This is when I realized that I don’t do nice things for people for fear of being despised for it. If I do dishes for someone else, I dread interactions because I do not expect gratitude at all. I expect, “Oh no, you didn’t do them as well as I would have. Look, you left this drink over here, etc.” I do not get caught off guard when I do nice things, so I mentally prepare for criticism. I also realized Anna operates in very much the same way. I’ve often noticed things like when she gets out of the shower and comes downstairs, I’ll enthusiastically say, “Oh I’m so thrilled!” Because she got out quickly enough for me to take a shower, and she’ll automatically start defending herself. “Hey, I was only in there for 12 minutes. And I cannot tell you how many times you went in there right as I was about to go in. Now we’re once even.” She’s not being rude, she’s just on the defensive, because she, I assume, like me, prepares for criticism and goes through it in her mind. Although I had legitimately just meant I was happy that she was quick. To infer upon another a third example, I will leave an allusion to a book called, “The sacred romance,” a paragraph where a child writes on daddy’s important business papers and says, “Look what I drew, daddy!” And then gets yelled at. There has to be a word for this. And I rarely cook for other people because what if they don’t like it? And they don’t tell me? If they tell me they don’t like it, then we’re cool. But if they say they like it, how do I know they aren’t just being nice? And this is something I’m working on because of a passage that I read that said, “Love believes all things.” So I try to not be suspicious of people when they praise me, but I’ll be honest, I really have to work at it.

There is so much preaching and teaching and thoughts out there, the world doesn’t really need me to tell them what one more person thinks. The trick is not coming up with new ideas, it’s sorting through the old ones. ______ starts with a plagerizing influence; the thoughts of one person replicating itself inside of you, so his thoughts become your thoughts. The porch Dallas did a sermon on choosing leaders. He meant choosing what you allow to influence you, because that’s what a leader does—he influences decisions. And that happens to us every day. Our job is to filter everything before us and keep what is good. If we can make it simpler, more compact, fewer words while saying more, do it. But don’t cut out meaning for the sake of shorter word count.

It is easier to surpress the first desire than to satisfy all that follow it. – Ben Franklin

When I say consumer drug-like music should be abandoned, I know that I have a very large audience automatically stepping back and saying, “Whoa now, I don’t trust this guy.” Because you require a very high degree of persuasive evidence to be compelled that something so ordinary, common, and massively consumed should be avoided. That’s the way I would definitely respond, and I did. And I think that’s a good thing. We shouldn’t believe every wind of doctrine; we should be anchored by a reasoned mind. It’s all over the Bible. Let us reason together; Paul cites skepticism as the reason men should be leaders instead of women, because women are more likely to receive new idea then men, and thereby be deceived as Eve was by the snake. And by Eve’s deception, so too Adam. So that’s why Paul says men should be the authorities, because we’re supposed to guard the congregation against myths “fit for women.” That, by the way, is due to the difference in hormone type and production levels in men and women, but we won’t get in to that. So it’s a good thing if you’re naturally skeptical about me saying, “Get rid of your ear buds.” I certainly spent hours of time listening to music. I loved all kinds, rock, rap, metal, modern praise, but it wasn’t until later that I developed an appreciation for classical and hymns. So if you’re there now, I was too. When I say, “Abstain from music… Music is bad more you… music is detrimental… music makes you dumber… music can have very dangerous influences on the gravity of your mood (that is, the central place you mood gravitates to, as in depression or anger)…” You’re response is going be, “What is this guy talking about? I like music! It doesn’t make me feel bad, it makes me feel good!” And that, is exactly the right response. That’s how science is done, it’s through observation and experience. You’re on the right track, you’re just wrong. When I say abstain from music, it’s analogous to when someone would say, “Abstain from gluten.” You’re thinking, “Abstain from gluten? What? Gluten doesn’t bother me! And it tastes good! I enjoy gluten. I’m not going to give it up because you say it’s bad.” But I’m here saying, “I know the way that you’re thinking. Gluten doesn’t give you a rash, it doesn’t give you any obvious illnesses, but let me tell you, when I gave it up, I was thinking more clearly, I was waking up in the morning with energy instead of being tired. It was like night and day, and I had no idea what gluten was doing to me.” That’s how it is with music. Probably, you’re immediate response is, “This guy is crazy—music does not have any ill effects on me. How dare he tell me to stop listening to 10,000 reasons!” Which I love that song, by the way. “I praise God with this music. I praise God for this music. Don’t tell me to stop listening to it.” Good, good. The reason this is good is because it means you are willing to listen to reason. You are willing to appeal to a sort of rationality that guards you against being deceived, which is good, but it’s good for my side of the argument too because that same rationality is what can identify when you are deceived. So let’s look at why I am saying music is by-and-large to be avoided. Before I get into the evidence for my thesis, I want to introduce some research that is going to raise your interest and curiosity. So this isn’t my evidence yet, this is just going to be to get you to raise the questions we will be examining. Dr. Masaru Emoto performed some experiments where he froze water at -30C while playing music to it. He then took pictures of the ice crystals under a photomicroscope and noticed the structures were very different depending on the music. This is intriguing. You might say, “Well, music is a longitudinal wave. It travels via vibrating particles in the air, so it makes sense that it would affect the structure of ice crystals as they freeze. There’s nothing intrinsic about it.” But we’re already getting interested. Some music produces beautiful structures, some music produces structure-less crystals. The question that follows is, “How or does this apply to the way our brains and bodies function?” How do neurons fire? Synapses pass electrical impulses. So could a vibration effect that? Well, obviously through our ears there is a process of transferring vibrations to meaningful electrical impulses in our brains that produces thoughts. Maybe. If you way “Potato,” I have identified that word through the vibrations that came into my ear and caused an electrical impulse to pass between synapses connecting my neurons which produced a thought, namely, “Potato.” So vibrations do effect the way our brain functions, the question is, is there anything intrinsically different about different sounds? We already know there is something extrinsically different between language, but is there a universal language what our brains connect by? One way of answering this is to look at brainwave entrainment therapy. There is something called the ____ feedback loop where your brain will adapt the number of synapses (cycles per second, which determines your brain state) that transfer an impulse in one second. This does not depend on your understanding of it, it’s something inherent to our biology, just like a 5 year old will get a boner in the presence of a naked women even though he doesn’t know what sex is. It’s something intrinsic that the body does regardless of extrinsic knowledge about it, like language. My mind does not automatically react to the word, “snifotioc,” because I have no idea what it means. My body, on the other hand, might. There’s might be something happening underneath my conscious mind that could influence something in my psychology. … So music produces opiates, damages the brain likened to that of a cocaine or porn addiction, and inhibits alpha brain functionality. That’s why music is highly addictive. Use it to praise. And then we’ll also talk about voices that should not exist outside of the bedroom. There’s a word for a woman’s groan that sets off all kinds of sex hormones in men which increases labedo, which has similar properties to many voices of women who sing in secular pop culture as well as in the praise team at church. It doesn’t belong there. Constrain your voice to sing loud but not sexy.

The next question, “What differentiates good music from bad music?” is for another youtuber. What I can tell you is that drums… I’m so sorry, I love drums, they get my hype, I’ve created over 120 songs with drums, I used to rap, I’m an artist… drums can set an easy mood at a party. “Boom, boom, boom, boom.” It’s like auditory bear. You can get music drunk and let loose from these songs. – I know what you’re thinking. “Music is life.” Don’t kill the messenger.

Women have a tendency to believe things more easily than men. It just means men don’t listen as eagerly as women. What else is new?

Jesus is out windshield wiper. … The truth is distorted. It isn’t wrong, it’s just blurry. It’s like driving in the rain without windshield wipers. There’s an aspect of truth in it, but it isn’t clear enough for you to drive home safely. You can maybe see the lights of the cars in from of you, but the lines on the roads begin to disappear and you lose your sense of the world. You can barely navigate through the bits and pieces of color darkly being broadcasted by the water rushing down your windshield. You have bits and pieces of the world, but you can’t tell where you are. You can’t read signs. All you can do it see the lights of other cars driving to and fro. But Jesus comes in and wipes off all the water and suddenly everything becomes clear for a moment. But then we mess up and sin to the point where it’s blurry again. What we need to understand is that Jesus is constantly making intersession for us. Once you put that windshield wiper on automatic, it does all the work. A lot of people think that the Christian life is life a windshield wiper that you have to continually push up to wipe away the rain. Jesus does all the work, but I’ve still got to push the knob up every time the rain gets too great for me to discern what’s in front of me. That’s not how it works. Christianity is an automatic setting. Once you make Jesus your savior, He doesn’t let the rain pile up. He keeps wiping it off again and again and again and again. As many times as the windshield requires. Once you believe on Jesus, He mediates for you continually. You don’t have to keep up with it. Just drive safely and get home.

There is a movie that came out in 2016 called Star Trek: Beyond, and it alludes to the story of a great hero, a man who fought for the federation valiantly, but at some point there came a time for peace. Eventually the hero became the main antagonist of the story, because for him, there was no place for peace. He was a soldier; he needed war. You see, there are two kinds of soldiers: soldiers that fight to protect or defend something, and soldiers that fight because it’s what they’re good at. For one of them, war is a means to an end. For the other, war is the end and the goal of their ambition. And so it is with those who are called by God. You see, Hebrews tell us that there will come a day when people will no longer say, “Know the Lord!” Because everyone will know the Lord. We won’t need sermons every week anymore; we won’t need evangelism and soul-winning anymore. None of that stuff is the goal here, it’s all a means to an end. But there are so many pastors and evangelist who have made what they do their identity, that I fear what will happen in the day when they can finally retire. They love the preaching, they love the praise from men, they love ministry and being compelling and being influential. They love all of the power. But is it for something, or do you just do it because it’s where you fit in? It’s what you’re good at? When the day comes that we no longer need you to preach and teach and evangelize, will you be happy that everyone is finally where they need to be, and our mission is over, or will you turn into an antagonist because you can’t bear the thought of living in a place where you aren’t recognized for your great wisdom and rhetoric? It’s Jesus. It’s always been about Jesus. And if it isn’t, then you’re not fighting for the end, you’re fighting for your own glory. Be sure that you have in mind when you preach a time when you will no longer be needed. Evangelism and preaching is a fight, not a home. It’s a war, not a way of life. Do you have Someone waiting for you when you get back?

People be like, what does the bible say about littering? You shouldn't need the Bible to make the case that littering is not okay. That isn't what the Bible was written for. It was written to restore broken humanity to God.

Why did you hate Christians? I’m going to surprise you. I started to hate Christians when I began to read the Bible for myself, and everything they taught me turned out to be wrong. We’re talking about maybe years of things and pages of reasons that I started to disrespect Christians, but the underlying reason is that from my perspective, the whole church functioned on the premise of breaking God’s first commandment: “Don’t make for yourself a graven image.” That is, don’t make a God to suit yourself, either with your hands or with your mind. When I started reading the Bible for myself, I started looking back at 16 years of things the church had taught me, and I realized a very great portion of those Sunday School lessons twisted the Bible on its head to make it say whatever they wanted it to say. They were performing hermeneutical acrobatics to make the Bible conform to their own agendas of, “Don’t do this, don’t do this, don’t do that.” That’s when the battle started. You can call it hypocrisy if you want, but the main point is I discovered a very stark contrast between what the Bible says and what the church taught me growing up. I’m not mad at the church! They’re hurting, and broken. I’m not mad, but it’s time we take the spirit of ugly off of Jesus’ bride. He says we are to present the bride holy and blameless and without blemish. The church is blemished now, but Christ still loves her and He’s never leaving her, so neither will I. But we can, and I believe this, we can remove the blemishes from Christ’s bride. We can.

I mean, we’re talking about years of things that slowly built up my disrespect for Christians.

Christianity is not, it not about being this perfect person. Christianity is about admitting that you’re not perfect and that’s why you need Jesus. I’m going to tell you something now that was hidden from all of humanity for 4,000 years. They didn’t know this, but 2,000 years ago this mystery was entrusted to the apostles and the Christians. Are you ready? The law was never intended to make you holy. The law was not given through Moses so we could keep it and live “good” lives. The law was given to show us our sin, to get us to a point where we fall on our knees and cry out, “I need a savior! Wretched man that I am!” The apostle Paul said, “The law is a tutor is bring us to Christ.” Or again, the end (or the goal) of the law, is Christ for righteousness. Not Ethan for righteousness. Christ for righteousness.

You want to talk about hypocrisy? I’m the foremost of them all. In fact, the closer I get to God, the more I see the depth of my sin.

I just propagated an argument that in psychology, there is a word for when you think you dreamt something and then it happens. I asked Faith to be sure to tell be next time she dreams a 10 second dream, because she said they almost always happen. She continued to point out that she only remembers it when it actually happens. To which I replied, “There’s a word for that in phsychology, I forget what it is. It’s basically a mirage but in your mind,” to which faith cut me off (and I was hoping she would), “What’s a mirage?” “A mirage is when you something that isn’t there.” Looking over at mom, I continued, “Mirages aren’t delusions. If I’m walking in the desert, I might see a town that’s actually miles away because the image is being displaced by the refractions of the light through the atmosphere. Mirages have been photographed. You really see them, but they aren’t there. In psychology, you can displace a sensory memory to another time with other circumstances because of the way the brain organizes and stores memory in working and long-term. It can err. It’s like a mirage of memory. You see it in one place but it’s actually in another place. My intellect and quickness is returning to me. The Lord is pruning the sin out of my life and being gracious to my petition. Let His faithfulness never cease to bring glory unto His name.

I have a very deep respect and love for business, but it isn’t for me for two reasons. I’m not an entrepreneur because I don’t have any product or service ideas. I also don’t like the inconsistency of being a small business owner. You can’t depend on a paycheck, you depend of the markets for what you’re selling. I don’t want to sell something to someone if they don’t need it, of I’m wasting my time. There’s a man who makes these glass sculptures in the fire, and it is truly remarkable, but I have absolutely no want or desire to purchase one, especially not for $200. It’s not worth it; I don’t even want one. I don’t think the world needs that. Business isn’t about making money; it’s about making a future. Traditionally, people have defined business as an organization that’s goal is profits, but recently people have started talking about a triple-bottom-line, where business aren’t just concerned with profits, but the averment and community as well. I also don’t want to me a “distributor” for somebody else’s product. I think Amway and Young Living prices are outrageous, and I don’t think their products are cutting edge and necessary. A wake-up light excites me, and I’ll tell people, “Hey, you should check out this new amazing product!” And they’ll buy it many times, but I don’t think I should be paid for that. That’s nonsense to me, I’m not working with my hands, I’m not producing anything good. I also don’t want to start my conversations with, “Buy my product.” I don’t think they need essential oils, I believe Jesus wants to heal them and through an act of faith, faith multiply’s. Business can get in the way of His kingdom. I know a lot of people think business can be a great tool of evangelism because once you rope them in you can share the gospel and they can be saved, and if that works for you, great, but I cannot do it that way without violating my conscience. People need to know I don’t have an agenda. That’s important for me. So network marketing is out.

“Ethan, did you get 100?” “I don't know, she didn't post it yet.” “Oh, she said she did.” “Oh sure enough, she just posted it like right now.” “You got 100… you don't have to show me.” And he got out in like 5 minutes; I wanted to kill him.” “Really?” “And then he got 100 on our accounting test! I'm selling you out.” “Oops. That was actually because of him, I took one of his questions.” As I'm walking out the door, Anwar shakes his head, “Man.” I hear as I'm leaving,  “Yeah he's a smart guy.”

“If a skydiver’s parachute doesn’t open the cause of death is not high impact, it’s the heart attack you have because you know you’re going to die. The body follows the brains lead.” ~ Chloe Sullivan

Pastor Anderson is a kind, loving, upright man, and I have come to respect him in the highest order. People are throwing around the word hate so frequently that word has lost all meaning. Leftists are hypocrites. You can't love the flowers without hating the weeds. And I stand by a hated for sin that Jesus came with. I formerly decided after watching a couple of sermons that Anderson was a very immature Christian with a short temper and a bad attitude. But he is not ignorant of the Bible nor in rebellion against it. After watching many of his sermons, I deeply respect the man.

Communism is not equality. It isn’t. Communism has such a nasty, distorted taint on it though, when I say it, doesn’t it? How about let’s call it community-ism? That’s what it means. It’s not a bad word. Or how about society-ism instead of socialism? It’s all aiming at the same common good. I don’t believe people are racist, and I don’t believe people are sexist, homophobic, or any of that nonsense. Let’s put these catchphrase, buzzwords out of our vocabulary and have meaningful conversations about what we’re trying to do, and how we’re trying to do it. If in school, say third grade, you have a black kid who has great parents, they’re raising him to be a hardworking, civilized member of society, and he works really hard on a class assignment, and his paper is really good, but then comes along a white kid who spent the night graffitiing his neighborhood and barely spent any time on the assignment, if the teacher gives them equal grades, that is not equality in the deepest, fullest, purest sense of the word. She is not treating the students equally, she’s treating them unequally, because she is giving a higher work-to-reward ratio to the white kid than the black kid, and that’s not okay. The word wages literally means you are getting payment that you earned for your work. -- In the Bible there’s a story of men that worked all day and men that worked for only an hour, and the guy at the top paid them all the same wage. – I do not believe that in America today, anyone is racist. When you throw the word racist around to talk about a police man who shot a black criminal who was threatning his life, or to talk about a Remark Milo Yanopolis made about a black woman looking like a man, and she did, because she had a man’s haircut, or to talk about Donald Trump questioning the impartiality of a Mexican judge regarding the issue of building a wall, given his heritage, it dishonors the thousands upon thousands of people who suffered, who were beaten, raped, whipped, enslaved, and murdered at the hands of racism. Racism does not exist today. I firmly believe that. It is conceivable that there are instances where a person may not be hired because of his ethnicity, her gender, but that is a far, far cry from racism. And even those instances, I believe, are few now and decreasing in number. This is not something that needs attention, and it’s not something that you can prove about someone. If you didn’t get the job, don’t blame it on the employer being racist. Did he tell you? Probably not. And in the absence of a confession, you are actually being unfair to him by assuming his reasons for not hiring you was his preference for a particular ethnicity. Here’s what racism is at its worst today: a black man is walking on the street, and a woman avoids walking that way for fear of him. That is the result of what psychologist call profiling, and it is not inherent to our human nature, it’s learned. So if you want people to stop avoiding black scary-looking men on the street, stop giving them a reason to, because the only reason they are scared of you is because of prior experience they have had with people who share the same characteristics as you. Immediately your subconscious says makes note of, “White, male, middle-aged, hick,” and begins to identify you with other people they know who share those qualities. That’s called profiling, not racism. If making notice of the variances in the behavior between a range of demographics is racist, we are truly a pathetic, self-entitled, irresponsible, unwilling to accept ourselves, unwilling to change ourselves generation. And we are dishonoring the people who have been strung up to a tree after being raped and beaten, and then battered to death because of racism. People still treat other people poorly today, and these kinds of crimes still happen, but they are not legal anymore. It is not okay for a while male to rape a black women. Blacks have the right to education, and many of you excel at it, we share busses and water fountains, and schools, and churches, and even families, and you’re going to tell me that we’re racist? Wake up to the progress humanity has accumulatedly evolved to over time.

I believe the LGBT lifestyle is sinful, wrong, and should not be accepted by society, but I do not think it should be enforced against with the sword, for two main reasons: 1. I disagree with pastor Anderson that LGBT people cannot be saved; I think they can be, because Paul said, “Such were some of you, but you were washed.” 2. I disagree with Rob Bell about Jesus’ model prayer of bringing God’s kingdom to the earth, I believe Christ’s kingdom is not of this world, and our job isn’t to assimilate and make the world righteous, it’s to get to world to Christ.

Partiality is to give different work the same treatment. Partiality is to give the same work different treatment. Partiality is not giving the same work the same treatment, but unfortunately we don’t understand that people have different jobs, use different skills, shoot for different levels of aspirations, and work different hours.

How many of you guys memorize scripture on a daily basis? Wow! That’s pretty good for a bunch of 6th graders. How many of have a smart phone? You need to get on your parents for that. For those of you who have them, type in google play right now, “Scripture Typer.” We are going to create a group with some verses. And we’re going to memorize in the KJV. Here’s why: … Look guys, Jesus said, “These things I have spoken unto you that my joy may be in ye and that your joy may be full.” Whose joy is full in here tonight? Then start to read your Bible.

Guys, I want to talk about something that we didn’t plan for or anything, but I think it’s really crucial that we talk about it. How many of you guys know what pornography is? I was about your age, maybe a little older, when I found out what it was, and you need to be prepared for it. I’m not going to ask your parents permission here, so keep it on the covert. I’m okay with getting in to trouble, because this is what the Spirit has laid on my heart for you guys. You are at an age when hormones are really wacked, you are super susceptible. But you have to stay pure. Here’s what happens to your brain. It’s worse than a coke addiction, and when you try to say no, it will be much harder a year from now than when you resist the first, initial inclination to look at a naked girl online. God made us a certain way that’s attracted, and these two things will meet before you are mature enough to say no: …. I was really late. Here’s why it’s wrong. Yeah, we’re going to get uncomfortable here, guys. We’re going to go down deep, because God’s word has a depth that if we miss it, we’ve missed out. I want you guys to leave here on fire for Jesus. Let’s do that.

How many of you love God with everything? What I’m going to teach you right now is not legalism. Okay, someone go to this verse, I want it to be your verse for understanding sin and grace. “Everything is permissible for me, but not everything is beneficial to me.” Why would I want to look like the world … Todd White (s16e11) Do you really want to know what God wants from you? (Francis Chan—look up) So we are going to nail this thing. We do not need to be watching TV and listening to music. Even worship songs. Check this out: … Hebrews says that Esau traded his birthright for a single meal, and afterwards found no place for repentance though he sought it with tears. Proverbs says that all who go to her house never return to the paths of life. I am in the business of strengthening your mind right now to prevent you from wasting years of your life, and maybe even preventing you from hell, because this thing is like a portal for despair, and after that disbelief. It happens, I’ve seen it happen. We need to avoid it, and if you have already looked at porn you need to come talk to me right now. When I was your age, I would have hidden it, because I thought I could deal with it myself. And I did, but it took 8 years, and hopefully you will have the wisdom to take a shortcut, because I did not have the boldness in 7th grade to tell anybody. We will have a confession time, and if this is an issue, I want you to tell me, or Brett. Okay?

I’m just going to prepare you right now, because I know my parents didn’t prepare me, a lot of parents never prepare their children, so if I’m messing up your parents’ parenting strategies, they shouldn’t have sent you here, to be taught by a college student. The Bible says few should be teachers, if they aren’t okay with my teaching, that’s their fault for appointing me a teacher. Even after I said no, twice. Did I tell you guys? I randomly got an email one day out of nowhere that said, “Dear Ethan, thank you for registering for D-Now.” Haha! Come on now! Who does that? My sister just filled in my information and signed me up to be a teacher, so it’s her fault. But we’re going to talk about this thing. If they aren’t okay with it, don’t bring me back next year, because this thing needs to be hammered.

Do thoughts require language? If in the absence of language, do thoughts require images? If in the absence of images, do thoughts require feelings? Can a person stop a steady stream of thoughts for an hour?

There should be a program that analyzes music and shows you what a aprticular song does to your brain. Something like an audio react that analyzes the wavelenths in real-time, but rather something that shows how water would react to it, and how the brain reacts to it. That would be useful.

## Marginal product of labor

Marginal product of labor decreases with additional workers. [[Fixed, Variable, and Marginal Cost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBQVaRnHqLs&index=44&list=PLAEA5E9ACA1508F92)]. Average fixed cost per unit produced goes down with additional employees, but average units produced per employee, or marginal product of labor, goes down with increasing employees. Pretty much as the number of employees increases, efficiency decreases because of factors such as . Average variable costs, on the other hand, goes down. As you add more employees, it costs you a little bit more per variable unit cost because they have to coordinate with each other, they have to plan a little bit more, it’s not all in one person’s head. And this is actually a real phenomenon that happens in companies. The more people you add on to a project, obviously they can do more work, but there’s going to be more coordination, there’s going to be more meetings, more interruptions, so each person’s individual productivity is going to go down.

Probably about 90% of the things that I say, people grasp one dimension of it, but they don’t know that there’s a deeper meaning behind it. I don’t explain it to them because, as I put it many years ago, when you plant a seed, don’t dig it up every day to see if there’s any growth.

People say they’re stronger together, but the truth is marginal product of labor decreases as employees have to coordinate with each other, plan more, there’s going to be more interruptions, etc. (So as an aggregate measure of all Christian’s impact on the world, we’re stronger alone). “Stronger together” is just a marriage cliché that people use to make it sound cute. You want my advice? Stay single. You’ll get more out of life. Maximize your marginal impact on the world by going it solo. #1corinthians7

Yes there needs to be a foundation of unconditional love, but that’s not exclusive between man and wife. Unconditional love is not the love you’re talking about when you say, “I love you” in a marriage. It’s not just a choice. There are feelings, and there are affections. Unconditional is what anchors the marriage when those things fizzle in and out, but a marriage without them is no marriage at all.

Hate protestors are hypocrites. That’s all they are. They’re hypocrites. That’s not a word that’s used enough when talking about liberals. They have their big signs that read, “I am NOT protesting the lection / I’m protesting HATE / I’m protesting TRUMP.” What’s clear to me is that they hate Trump. Their own signs are Characterizing Trump by his so-called hate. If I was into their name-calling game, I’d say “That’s miseophobic!” (fear of hatred). You cannot lump all hatred into one word and say it’s absolutely bad. I mean, define hate. Give me a definition, and I’ll show you that either you hate Trump by your own definition, or that Trump doesn’t fit into your definition. You don’t even know the man, you don’t have a ready definition for hate, but you’re willing to label him as the embodiment of hatred. That’s pathetic. It’s self-defeating to hate hatred, because now you have to hate yourself for your own hate, unless you admit that not all hatred is bad, in which case you should burn your slogans that generalize all hatred into one word, “I’m protesting HATE.” Hatred of what? Hatred of good? Hatred of evil? The latter is a good, pure, and holy hatred. The first is what protesters do by and large. Is hatred a feeling or a verb? No matter which way you spin it, hate protesters have it. And that’s why I say they’re hypocrites. It’s a double standard. They hate the people that they say hate other people.

And for those of you who say, “I don’t hate the person, I hate his hatred!” You can’t separate the sin from the sinner. I mean, what are you saying? You don’t hate his body, you just hate all of his thoughts? People aren’t their body’s; it’s the internal mental states that determine who a person is. Or in the words of Batman’s girlfriend, “It’s what we do that defines us.” Let me show you why this is biblical. Matthew 10:28 Jesus said this: “Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.” Jesus is reasoning on the premise that you are not your body. You are something beyond that: your soul. Or again: “It is not what enters into the mouth that defiles the man, but what proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man.” He’s saying sin isn’t characterized by physicality, by your body, it’s characterized by the internal mental states of a person, which is who you are. If you hate somebody’s sin, you hate them too. “God hates everyday the workers of iniquity.” Don’t tell me hatred is all equal. The sad thing is, your hated for the hatred of evil justifies the evil, gives a safe space for evil, and you hate what is good. You love what is evil and hate what is good (hatred of evil). Isaiah prophesied rightly of you, “They will call good evil and evil good; substitute darkness for light and light for darkness, bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!”

When I hear a person shouting at the top of their lungs in protest, as if they were an animal (a dog barking at a stranger), their dignity is so tarnished by that, it is inconceivable to me to consider that person a human being. What has happened to their minds that they would just bombard other people with their thoughts without letting them talk? America has this thing called free-speech, which is what you hide behind, but when you don’t let the other person talk, it really isn’t free speech at all, is it? Your mind has become so debased, self-entitled, hypocritical, unwilling to be civil, there’s nothing I can describe you as except an animal. I mean, have you ever seen a protester change their mind during a protest? They aren’t interesting in having a discussion. They came there with their minds made up, they’re closed minded, and they are not willing to listen to anybody. That’s revolting, and it makes me sick to think that there are people like that in the world, who are so closed minded and ideologically-bigoted that they refuse every invitation to have a discussion, and instead they just yell at the top of their lungs, “[HATE SPEECH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANgl54duC0A).” It’s irrational, it’s irritating, it’s anti-democratic, and I have more respect for a lion than for you. Thank the founding fathers the first Amendment only applies to government, so I can through you out of private events.

Do not forget Reader’s Rabbit, Jump Start Second Grade, Chips Challenge, Dos Games, Lasor Age, Sim City, Rollar Coaster Tycoon, and the myriads of other games that laid the foundation of my learning and the learning of my brothers and sisters. We competed, we played these for hours, and we were committed to beating each other. We didn’t think of them as learning, we were just playing. But without a doubt, they helped forge my brain development immensely, maybe more than anything else, including school. Don’t give your kids the more “advanced” games like Knights of the Old Republic until they’ve played this foundational games first. They are so important, and I had all but forgotten what a computer meant to me before I bought a laptop and began exploring all that it could do. It’s almost a safe place for me, a place of reminecnece, of all the amazing things we did as children on computers. This experiences will dimish from society unless we preserve them; and we should preserve them. “Call of Duty” is no substitute, Smash Bros U does not replace the 64 version, and New Mario Bros should be postponed until after they’ve played Super Mario Bros. This is history, and this is so important for the brain development of future generations. The simple must precede the complex. I have spoken. - Background pictures used to be simple colors or patters, not memory verses and pictures. - Find the setup EXE, run in compatibility mode with the OS the game was made for, and check the 620 x 480 resolution checkbox to make it full screen. For jumpstart 2nd Grade, refer [here](http://blog.ryankempt.com/2013/12/64-bit-windows-unsupported-16-bit.html).

It makes very little sense to withhold the internet from students doing a lab or taking a test, because they will always have this resource available to help them along in life, but instead we sometimes let them have a textbook, which they almost assuredly will not use in looking for solutions to problems in life. Education needs to be rethought; ut has things backwards.

I want to make my videos not only visual and auditory, but interactive (kinesthetic), like Kent Hovind or the dating couch that invited the viewer to identify rows of triangles and squares. Color like pragur. Logic like Piper. Graphics like Education Portal or Kham Academy. Organization like dana Mosely. Professional like James series (Chan), and funny.

There are good, healthy relationships that need to be cut off because they influence you to be unwise with your time. There’s dilly-dally small talk, TV, all good things, but you ought to be doing something eternal.

It seems to me that the human eye is evolved to look at subtractive primary colors, not additive primary colors. You don't look at the sun, you shouldn't look at lights. We all know what eye strain is if you've been looking at a plasma screen too long. I want to know what effects this shift from subtractive light to additive light has on the brain, if any.

If morality depends on a subjective good (i.e. good _for_ someone and maybe not for someone else), than there is a crucial things we must determine. If we assume the worst possible misery for collective humanity is bad, we’re lumping all of humanity into one group, which overlooks the concept of punishment. It overlooks the concept of dignity, and the displacement of it thereof. Is it right to seek the well being of Hitler? Not if it causes two or more people harm. What about a theif? What about a peeping Tom? There needs to be an understanding of the self-denigration of one’s own humanity that causes you to not seek their well being, and in so doing terms like “collective humanity” becomes obsolete, because you really should be asking what’s good for “collective _good_ humanity,” or the collection of people who’s well being will conjointly build up the well being of others. So now he have to factor in some measure of goodness, or dignity. Adolf Hitler tarnished his dignity by causing harm to two or more people. It was bad _for_ more people than it was good for. Even the Bible doesn’t use objective language when talking about morality. God says things like, “You’ve done what is right _in my sight_,” or, “The Lord has brought this evil on you.” Well, the Lord can’t be objectively evil, but the Bible itself says God caused evil to a person, so it must be a subjective usage of the word. Why would the objectivity of the good nature of God make evil right in a subjective sense? That is, even if it is objectively right for me to be killed, why should I look at it as being right? It isn’t right for me, it’s right for whoever wants me dead. But I digress. There has to be something of value in a person for his well being to matter or contribute toward the collective good of humanity.

I think a Designer is necessary to explain us. If evolution were true, I would expect to see other highly intelligent evolved specious, but we don’t. There is no close second to our innovation, communication, and it’s not just about what we’re familiar with. It’s obvious when you look at human society, tehre is something that sets us way apart from any other specious on planet earth. Our civilization is unique, but if evolution were true, we ought to find other evolved creatures to match or at least come close to our intelligence. The truth is, even if we did find the “missing link,” because that missing link has evolved further than frogs or geraffs or monkeys or wherever it came from, we should expect the antecedent primitive specious to die, not the advanced specious to die. If natural selection helped specious survive, it’s strange none did between primate and human. We are so far advanced, that screams, “Special!” Image of God-special.

What makes homosexuality wrong or not wrong does not depend on whether it is a learned behavior or something you are born with, which I don’t believe, but I’ll grant it to you without argument because I think that’s an irrelevant conversation. Maybe you’ve tried to suppress your affections toward other members of your sex and failed, and at some point you decided, “If I can’t stop these feelings, God’s okay with it.” I can’t stop my feelings to have sex with women, but that in no sense justifies fornication, and in no sense, justifies lust. There is a biological reason for attraction, and it makes me very curious what causes homosexual attraction in the brain. From an evolutionary standpoint, attraction is the biological means of reproducing. The man sees the woman, he gets excited, and babies happen. There are indicators of fertility, estrogen can be correlated to the curve of a woman’s hips, testosterone obviously has a lot of consequences (lower voice, strength, leadership, longer nose). Attraction is innate to our biology, and it’s perplexing to think about why a person’s biology would sexually orient them to the same sex. That’s obviously not for survival; it’ll make you extinct. One thought I had, is that it says in Romans 1 the reason a person is gay is because God has rejected them and given them over to a debased mind. Maybe it’s God’s way of making sure reprobates can’t have children. The God-haters will die out if they are attracted to a con-creative relationship. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JJM0ewta0I) is of a gay man coming out to his conservative Christian dad. You can hear the wavering in his voice as he gets this off his chest. Just listen to him. The first thing I immediately think of is to say, “I do not hate you. But it’s for that reason that I am not going to lie to you about the weight of that confession. I believe in heaven and hell.” But my conscience will not let me say, “I don’t hate you,” not because it would be a lie, but because I have this nagging question mark in the back of my head that wonders if God wants me to hate those that He hates, and if God hates them. Because he says don’t enter a house of mourning. He says His soul hates the workers of iniquity. He destroyed these. But that would mean he hates me too, right? Because I’m still a worker of iniquity even if I’m not gay? So what does this mean? Anderson has really messed me up. I just don’t know anymore. --- By and large, the reason I think the way I think about gay people has nothing to do with my time reading the Bible. There are 8 verses about homosexuality in the Bible, out of 31,102. I have never picked up my Bible and come out thinking, “Man, God just really hates gay people and wants us to hate them too.” Never once. The reasing I believe what I believe about gay people if from so-called homophobobes that scrubbed the Bible to find verses that support their anti-gay people agenda. And they found 8. But they aren’t as clear as they make it seem. In Genesis Sodom and Gomorrah went after “strange flesh.” That word is hestros, not homo. It would seem they may be talking about Nephlym, especially in light of the book of Jashur. Leviticus 18:22 pretty much puts it on par with bestiality, calling it an abomination. But given it’s context I never came out of reading Leviticus 18 thinking about Homos. I was thinking about the verses that talk about hetrosexual sin, becacuse those are the ones that apply to me, so maybe it was just a bypassing of my personal mind because it didn’t stick out to me as important. Kinds of like, “Do not murder.” Milo Yiannopoulos. I would hate to see him be put to death at the hands of a righteous government, but if it is right, so be it. I have great respect for him, and I don’t really think of him as gay.

 Jesus wasn’t anti-rich. This is what happens when atheists race through the Bible to cherry-pick passages eisegetically to use against Christians. There are entire colleges and volumes upon volumes of scholarly work, hundreds of years gone into the interpretation of the Bible, and you’re just going to come along with one cursory reading of it, wave your arm over it and you think that makes you qualified to tell me what’s in the Bible. That’s fine if you also provide the specific examples and let me show you that you’re reading it eisegetically, but when you just tell me your conclusions without references, I have the complete privilege to say, “Nope, you’re wrong,” without providing references. You’re going to fire like 20 very deep issues in 1 minute, and you think you’ve done the Bible justice? These are not things to just wave your hand over and breeze past. Write on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhD_JmYNqoY) and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGL5eRw7rXU) (~~2:14:00~~).

It is easier to keep on cheating then to start cheating, and if I moved out I would eat healthier, because I would only buy healthy ingredients and healthy food. When you're shopping, you apply more thought to your decision, where as when you grab a chocolate as your walking by, that's an impulse. – lolly pop, makes her tired but given as a remedy to tiredness. Hypoglycemia. Skeptical doctors write note to give her sugar to give her energy. Drug tolerence. Need an escape, drug makes you feel rotten, need an escape from drug-wrought rottenness, do more drugs to escape it. Vicious cycle.

When most people talk to my mom,  it's a recap of tgeir day, or maybe they want advice about an upcoming decision, but usually it’s just talking about stuff in there life. When I talk to my mom it’s always a recap of my recent thoughts on things. Psychology, science, medicine, philosophy, God; the only time I talk about my experiences is when it’s connected to one of those things. I'm not interested in the conversation I had with my friends about a project we’re working on, I don't expect my mom to be. I'm interested in gaining insight into parts of life and reasoning that forges the future of our understanding about things. It's innovative. I want to talk about applied kinesiology and water and research. Life events are generally pretty inglorious, undeserving of attention and conversation. Why should we waste our time talking about mundane everyday life? That's silly to me, and I like my mom because she incorporates a point to her stories during our conversations. It's not long winded boringness, it’s using life experiences to confirm or reject hypotheses. I love it.

When people rant off a slew of “immoral” things God did, I just say, “God’s judgement was upon them, and Jesus who came will come again, and he will come with judgement.” I don't need to defend God. If there is a good dynamic for me to have a conversation, of course I’m going togive an answer, but if they are just ranting off slews of twisted passages, logic is out of their grasp, because that form of argumentation is never used by someone who is interested in listening.

Saying someone doesn't have the Holy Spirit because he doesn't understand the KJV is like saying someone doesn't have the Spirit because he didn't understand Greek, or spanish, or another translation. In 400 years, the English language has morphed significantly. Good grief, if you watch a movie from the 1990’s vs. now you can see that people talked a lot differently 20 years ago even. Language is dynamic, and God's word isn't in the same sense. It isn’t about the words they use, but how they're strung together. Yet, if I read aloud from the KJV, 6th graders can tell me what it’s saying. My brother makes a mockery of this translation, and I really need to not be infected by his thinking.

Caleb does not get to tell me that he has trouble learning things. He's a smart guy. He has learned all kinds of car things, mechanic things, autocad things. The problem is not his capacity to learn, the problem is his disinterest in the things of God.

After you tell a story, a parable, ask the kids, “Someone give me the punch line.” 99 times out of 100, they know exactly where you're going.

One of the questions church leaders ask is how they can get people interested in living for God. How can you get them “on fire,” so to speak? One approach is to tell them they are not saved if they maintain lukewarm affiliation with God. But really though, I shouldn't need to destabilize a person's salvation to get their minds set on God. Then again, fear is the beginning of wisdom. But why wouldn't we just want to live that way? Why wouldn't we want to love completely sold out? Todd White attraction is awesome, but here’s the reason: because you have to take up your cross, and you still treasure the things of the world more than the things of heaven. There's a psychological reason for this, it’s called loss aversion. You can rationalize that future rewards outweigh present rewards, but it impacts the human psyche little. If it didn't, you would want to take up your cross. You works want to … look, just number your days,  that you might gain a heart of wisdom.

Most people can listen up to 400 words a second. Most lectures and sermons are spoken at about 150 words per minute. This difference leaves our mind with plenty of time to wander. Therefore, increasing the playback speed is not only a time-saver, but an attention maintainer (PSYC).

I subtitled my Learning Theory paper, “The Perils of Cramming.” This is an example of a subtitle that belongs to a paper which demonstrates the subtitle, rather than explains the subtitle.

I’ll probably kill myself. And I say that with a smile. It’s not a big deal to me, and people want to make it a big deal. “Life is but a cheap price for a worm to part with.” The reason people want to make it a big deal is because we all automatically attribute more dignity to a human than to a worm. If I squish a worm, nobody really cares. Maybe there’s one person in a crowd, but it still isn’t that big of a deal to them. But if you could get inside my mind and understand my perception of myself, and the thoughts I have for myself were your thoughts, it wouldn’t be a big deal for me to die, because my dignity is less than a worm’s in my own sight. I’ve made myself that way by participating in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, things that are disgraceful even to speak of. When I look into the mirror, I see eyes full of disgust. If I killed myself, you’d say, “Oh but you had so much value, and worth, and dignity.” But if my thoughts were your thoughts, you’d just walk by and say, “Huh, a squished worm.” It’s because I keep my deeds hidden that my thoughts are not shared by you. Don’t pretend like you are in a better position to judge my dignity than I am. Don’t you dare pretend that preventing suicide is automatically an obligation, and that you know the difference between a dead worm and a dead man. You’re not in the position to know what’s in a man’s heart. Only he knows that. And that’s why his life matters so little to him, and apparently so much to you. If only you knew, then you would understand. If only you knew the thoughts as your own, not just perceived my thoughts with the mind, but felt them with your heart, adopted them with your soul, you would know that my life being thrown away is something that can be talked about with stoic eyes. It doesn’t have to be a buzz kill. Save that for people who are worth it. – This isn’t because of Christianity. It’s because of a lack thereof. If I had a relationship with Christ, there’s no way I would kill myself. The Bible says Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee. But I don’t have peace because my eyes aren’t set on Him because it’s the pure in heart to see him and my heart isn’t pure. It isn’t because of Christianity that I see myself as dirt, it’s because of sin. Christianity is my only hope to not see myself as less valuable than a worm. Here’s why: you don’t pay more for something than it’s worth, and heaven went bankrupt to purchase me. That’s Christianity. The reason my dignity is so tarnished in my own sight is because of a lack of Christianity. My heart just doesn’t believe it. I know the facts in my head, the history of Jesus, I believe what he said is True, I believe the Bible, but my heart cannot cope with the truth my mind agrees with. I love God with my strength and mind, but my heart and soul can’t fathom what God says about me, and love believes all things, so I guess I’m lacking in two parts. I know it, but I don’t feel it. And my feelings betray my knowledge, just as when I know studying is good for me, but I don’t feel it. My uncles has no feeling in his right hand. The nerves got fried and he lost all feeling. So when his hand is on fire, he doesn’t feel a thing, but he can see it with his eyes, and his actions follow his knowledge, not his feelings. “MY HAND IS ON FIRE, YEE HAH.” He’s going to take care of it. But my knowledge for one reason or another stays behind my feelings. I feel my hand burning though I can see there is no fire. And I will rush to the water to put it out, to ease the pain even thought I know there is no fire on it. This irrational feeling takes precedents over my knowledge. It is when your tongue believes something spicy is hot. You tongue literally gets confused, and emulates the sensation of heat. It’s a false feeling, and you know it’s incorrect, but you’re going to put water on it anyway. Mint makes water taste much colder. It doesn’t actually make it colder, your brain just gets confused. It feels things that aren’t true in reality. So do I. So do I.

No, I am not for equality between men and woman. There are differences between men and woman, and if you don't conduct your treatment of both to accommodate for those differences than we’re not being fair. Women have 35% less muscle mass. I don't think it’s somehow wrong to have an understanding I  society that if you’re going to hit anyone, and you shouldn't, but of you do, you do not hit a woman. Women have less testosterone, more estrogen. I don’t think it's wrong for a woman to say, “I don't want a man checking me for breast cancer.” That's modesty. But you have to admit, when you acknowledge the differences between men and women, and make subsequent decisions based on that acknowledgement, it is not treating them equally. It’s right, but it's not equal. Women should hear they are beautiful, men should hear they are conquerors; that's what the science suggests, and I try to align my beliefs with facts, not feelings. I don't think women should have urinals in their bathrooms. It's not equal the way it is, it's tailored to our differences, and that's the way it should be. Legislation should treat men and women the same, because you need to evaluate every person on their own basis, but it’s okay for people to make initial assumptions based on gender.

I’ve never had somebody say, “O wow, you’ve changed my mind. I want to become a Christian.” But I have had a lot of conversations with atheitsts about theism, and you can tell when somebody is sort of considering what you’re saying, they get it and it’s going to keep them up at night, versus people that just squint their eyes with skepticism and throw you to the side. What I’ve found is that it’s helpful not to present my arguments from the top down, like, “Here’s the cosmological argument for the existence of God. Premise 1:…” Because then I’m making myself out to be someone with answers. People are more responsive and considerate of someone with questions. You give them a question, and manipulate it in a way that evinces your line of reasoning. “What qualities would that thing have to have?” (Sirat Education, agnostic conversation).

There are differences between men and women and if we don’t treat them in a manner that accommodates for those differences we are doing them a disservice.

If God, then… Fill in the blank. We are arriving at an age of such technological advancement, God is not only being dismissed as God, but forgotten as well. In almost every respect, I resonate with those who do not agree with the assumption that there was or is a God. If there is research that can put human genetics in the hands of men, I would be as Saul and hold the coats of the men who are doing it, giving hardy approval. Can we create bullet proof skin by harnessing the genetic information in a spider that creates its web? Can we eliminate the genes in our DNA that cause allergies and intolerances? Can we make ourselves impervious to disease? Research is advancing and it isn’t slowing down. What we once thought was impossible, it seems is unlimited. Can we create an artificial eco system on other planets? Some are saying it is unethical to clone humans, combining the human embryo with optimal animal genetics in the name of evolution. I say let’s do it! So what if there are some mistakes? A child crying, dying. They have allegedly added human genes to cows. Can we make the ultimate evolutionary end game? Our primitive genetics will be nothing in comparison to the species we may create. Smarter, stronger, healthier, immune. Why wouldn’t we do this? In everything we are doing, God is forgotten. We do not even inquire of him, because there is not a respected man who hears from him. Who at some point in their life haven’t called out to God and been let down? “God didn’t answer me.” “If God does exist, then he isn’t interested in me.” We tried to reach out, but we didn’t hear anything. But what if it’s true? What if God actually exists, and the Bible is the actual words of God Almighty? What if all of our silly little advancements in science are laughable to Him? He created all of this, the universe, us, all the intelligence behind it. He put us here to watch over everything. To rule the planet and keep it straight. But we’re more interested in using the animals we were meant to watch over to advance our own genetics. Is cloning okay with God? It seems so obvious that God was an invention of man to enforce their own agendas. It seems like God is a superstition. But I don’t believe that. The whole world is moving in that direction. We all have to provide reasons for our beliefs. There is no such thing as an appeal to authority anymore. It is always an appeal to science and logic and reasoning. And I am totally on board with that. It’s called civility. The problem arises when that reasoning and logic is confronted by what the Bible teaches. And those who uphold the Bible, or are upheld by the Bible, say such things as, “Lean not on your own understanding,” to disqualify what makes sense to us and them. This is where conversations are futile, because their understanding of the Bible teaches them to close their ears and disregard what others are saying. But Jesus came to open ears, not to close them. I don’t think it’s wrong to listen. Maybe it is. But it seems so right to me. It seems like homosexuals and fornicators and liars and all manner of sinners should not be put to death or avoided. I legitimately like people, but under Steven Anderson’s yoke, I am not allowed to. I just so confused. There are people that I would like to see dead. Arrogant, violent, cursing men who will not hear you. Those who have shut the door to reason and civility. The word of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing. Do I believe this book or not? If I do, what else could matter? When people say God appeared to them, I don’t believe them. And it’s because they don’t seem like honest people to me. And because God has never appeared to me. If God is real, why doesn’t he appear? None of this represents me. But for a moment, just a moment, I am writing honestly. Soon, I will remember the answers to these questions. I’ve asked them before, and I’ve probably written down the way I resolved it in my head. But I’ve forgotten.

I think it’s hilarious when people get upset over pastors who preach hard against sin. Let me just explain where I’m coming from. I don’t know if you’ve seen the biggest loser, but the trainers on that show are constantly getting in the contestants’ faces, shouting at them, yelling at them to go harder, “How bad do you want it?!” “Bad!” Because that’s how trainer’s dot heir job. They have to be loud, hard, and ruthless to be effective. Tell me again what scripture is useful for? *Training* is righteousness? But we want our pastors to just stand quietly by the pulpit, present various interpretations of a passage, and let the audience decide which interpretation is right. And if we disagree, that’s aye-okay. To each his own… Imagine if Bob Harper and Jillian Michaels trained that way. “Well, if you get on that treadmill you might lose some way, but who really knows, there’s a lot of theories going around.” That’s not how you get people to lose weight! Why are we surprised when it’s not how you get people to lose sin? You might be able to persuade someone to walk easefully on the treadmill that way, but you are not going to get them to push to their limits or fight hard enough to make any progress. And yet we have more tolerance for body trainers than for spirit trainers. We give them leeway to yell at us, but not our pastors. It’s ridiculous. We need hard preachers, not compromising preachers. And doctrinal preaching, not shallow preaching.

I’m pretty bad with syntax, and brevity has never been my strong suit.

There are times when honesty is less virtuous than lying through your teeth to protect the dignity of another person.

“Porn isn’t a sin.” Really? Can you separate lust from pornography? Is lust a sin? You have your answer.

I have heard this very silly argument that says the reason men work harder at jobs and less hard raising the children is because the culture isn't set up to encourage men to share the load. As if men are the product of culture, when in fact it is quite the opposite. Culture is the product of men.

The KJV was a very good translation. God promised to preserve His word, but newer translations are based on newer developments (dead sea scrolls) and outlier early manuscripts (Alexandrian). Now if the KJV was a preserved translation from manuscripts that God had preserved until that time, and newer translations are departing from it based on the newer Greek, there is a strong argument that these newer translations are the preservation of God’s word. If it departs on one point, it is no longer preserved. The KJV has been refined 7 times.

The reason I won’t subscribe to KJVO hangs on two if’s that I think maybe are true, but I'm not willing to gamble on it. If other translations are the word of God, and if attributing the word of God to the devil is blasphemy, than KJVO is blasphemy. Not to mention the Bible says there is no truth in the devil, but there is truth in the NIV. Now, whoever blasphemes the Son of God will be forgiven, and Jesus is the word, but it is so dishonoring I'm not willing to risk it. KJVO hangs on to ifs.

I find hate speech altogether more tolerable than protest.

A lot of people get weirded out when you start talking about people in terms of, “Oh he’s a prophet,” or, “He’s false prophet.” Like, “Prophet? Really? Isn’t that kind of a thing of Bible times?” And it comes from a misunderstanding of prophesy. What you need to know is that prophets are not fortune teller. Prophesy isn’t a forecast of future events. When prophets prophesy, they are telling of the promises of God. Prophesy is always treated as a promise, not a crystal ball. A prophet came to Hezekiah and said, “Set your house in order, because you’re going to die.” That’s a prophesy. But when Hezekiah wept before God, God gave him another 15 years. If prophesy was foreknowledge, that would make God’s foreknowledge fallible. So much for his crystal ball. But foreknowledge doesn’t exist. It’s philosophically incompatible with A-theory of time, with freedom of the will, and myriads of other things. Prophesy isn’t foreknowledge, it’s promises. So if you go out into the world and tell of the promises of God, then you’re a prophet. If you are wrong about what you are saying, you’re a false prophet. It starts to make sense why Jesus called David a prophet. “Prophet? David never said anything about future events!” But he constantly proclaimed the promises of God. People like Ray Comfort take the promises of God and flip it on its head. He’s a false prophet. “If you don’t work out your salvation, than by deductive reasoning your not a saved Christian… if it walks like a duck…” He doesn’t say anything about the gospel, about believing on Jesus Christ. He’s stuck on deductive reasoning which is false. Let your faith lie not in the reasining of men.

Sometimes prophecies treated as commands from the Lord, I can see you hurt. CrossFit just messenger. Or another example is with Nana. Jonah didn’t include and unless you repent Claus and his message. It was a promise but it did not turn out that way.

“Did you buy such an such?” “Well, the way I figure it, there’s a reason they call me a dependent.”

Caleb can’t provide any imput on this problem, but somehow when he came along, I figured it out. It wasn’t because he knew anything about quantity variance, it was that I had to explain it to him, and in doing that I unlocked something that I hadn’t seen before. 55 cents per pound.

Here’s the paradox. Any girl that’s stupid enough to want to share a life with me, is too stupid for me to want to share a life with.

Christians want to say, they can’t deny my testimony, but of course they can. The ability to deny your testimony is the reason that people like Richard Dawkins can write best selling books like The God Delusion. It’s a simple matter of holding empirical evidence above anecdotal evidence, which every single person on this Earth who is fair does. Anecdotal evidence and hearsay are worth very little in a court of law for the very reason that you can deny somebody’s testimony.

What are you doing man, putting that silly talk in your mouth? Just be pure. Lewd jesting—it has no place with the sons of God. Let’s cast it off. Put off the old self which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit. We’re being corrupted. It’s not getting better, it’s getting worse. You’ve got to put it off.

Nobody knows they are pregnant the day after they had sex. Stop saying “it’s 5 cells.” By 48 hours tge zigot will have completed the stage of mitosis that firms all 64 cells of a fetus. Nobody has an abortion on a zygote, that's just nonsense. – A house with no one in it is still a house.

Don't give me that rape dilemma. If someone ran up to a stranger and shoved their baby in her hands and ran off, would you for one second rationalize, “She didn’t ask for that. Just kill it.” We’re talking about life. We can’t have a discussion about murder without two elements: in order to say something is murder, you have to define that life is. And in order to say the murder is wrong, you have to establish the dignity of the one being murdered. The reason abortion videos change people’s mind is that when they see the pictures of what’s happening, they see dignity in the fetus. When you understand life, human life, you understand dignity. If it’s a cockroach, not so much. The question isn’t only about life, but of dignity. Whether she likes it or not, that baby is in her hands now, and she can either hand it off to someone else, or keep it.  But not kill it.

It would be nice to have my minitor and keyboard in my room with my actual computer in the hallway, because of the noise. They should make a system that connects a monitor to your computer over network or something like that.

God punishes the sinner, not the sin.

You can get closer to the bunny in cold weather then when it’s warm.

Paul said “Everything is permissible for me, but not everything is beneficial.” If you understand this verse you will win at life. Here’s the decision rule: do what’s beneficial, and don’t do what’s not beneficial. You say “What about permission?” What is permission? Permission means I can do something without getting punished. Right? It makes the person who gave me permission responsible for what I do, so that if there is punishment involved it goes to the person who gave me permission. If your dad gets angry because you ate the last piece of cake, you say, “Well mom said I could.” And your clear. That’s what permission does. It clears you of the wrath of your father for screwing him over with that piece of cake. So permission means I can do something without getting punishment. That does not mean that there aren’t consequences for what you do. Lets say you are allergic to strawberry pie, and if you eat it you’ll get punished. Mom says, “Son, you have my permission to eat strawberry pie.” Do you get all excited? “For real? Thanks mom!” You’re not going to get punished for eating the pie. Woo hoo! Guess what? You’re going to be miserable if you eat it. Because your still allergic to it. Permission makes punishment go away, it does not make consequences go away. So what Paul is saying is, “Look, the punishment is all on Jesus. You don’t have to worry about that. What you’ve got to watch out for is that strawberry pie that your allergic too. Because that’s not beneficial.” Look, sin is never beneficial to you, even if you don’t get punished. (It makes you depressed, if makes you angry, you hate yourself, and down the road you’re going to look back at what you did and regret it. You say, “Well I just robbed a bank last month and now I’m a million air. What do you mean that’s not beneficial if I don’t get punished?” Guess what? God’s wrath is not against you for that, but there are still consequences. When you live a life of sin, you forfeit closeness with God. Jesus said the pure in heart see God. If you’re looking at a woman with lust for her, you’re not going to be punished for that, but you forfeit 20/20 vision to see God. And you know what? The consequence of sin is your joy. You have a million dollars in the bank, but you do not have joy. And you know what? The world is passing away! You’re going to lose that money when you die, and all of your bigger barns are going to be burned up, and when you get to heaven you’ll be as one just escaping the fire. You’ll have nothing to show for all your years on earth, nothing that mattered in your whole life. That’s the consequence of living a life of sin and vanity.) When you sin, there are intrinsic consequences for what you did. Sexual sins, for example, do harm to your body and your ability to share a life with someone. Paul said you sin against your own body. How many people know what operant conditioning is? It’s when kids can’t see the intrinsic consequences or value of doing things, so we apply extrinsic consequences or rewards to them. Extrinsic consequence is punishment. When you’re little, you don’t see the danger of playing in the street. So mom and dad say, “You will be punished for playing in the street.” I promise, that spanking had nothing to do with doing what you did. It’s totally external to the danger of it. And usually punishment is set up to protect you from what you can’t see that the person who punishes you can see. But punishment is eliminated at the fulfilment of the law when Jesus died. So the question is not, “Do I have permission to do this?” The question is, “Is this beneficial?” Understand consequences, and do what’s beneficial. That’s how to play this game.

Homeschoolers are weird. – Mmm. Right. - …not me. – No I was just agreeing with you. – No I’m just kidding, I’m about as weird as they comes. Why would I want what the world has when I can have what Jesus offers? The world is sad and depressed, and they have their little spurts of short pleasures and happiness, but they don’t have joy. Not to mention the world is passing away. The Bible says, “Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee, because he trusteth in thee.” But if your mind isn’t stayed on God because you don’t trust Him, you don’t have peace, you never will. That verse tells me the world doesn’t have peace. I don’t want what the world has. Jesus said, “These things I have spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.” Is your joy full? If the answer is no, read. But the world can’t receive the words of Jesus because their heart is the wrong soil. And if you can’t receive the words of Jesus, you don’t have joy, and you never will. All the world can have is this short, miserable, little moment of shallow happiness. Why would I want they when I can have the fullness of joy? And when I say joy, a lot of people think I mean content. Like, “Well, even though I got in a car accident, I know God’s in control and everything will work out in the end.” No, that’s not what joy is. Picture someone rejoicing. Like there is a feeling inside that just overflows automatically, they can’t help but praise God. Joy is the intensity of God’s goodness being made manifest in our hearts and in our bones that we don’t have a choice but to smile and sing and rejoice over it. The joy of the world isn’t as deep, or intense, or as full as the joy of God, and the joy of the world is passing away but the joy of God is everlasting, it never fades.

Discrimination based on an immutable characteristic is what’s not okay. Discrimination in and of itself is not a bad thing, it’s actually a bit of a blurry word. If I have an employee, one working 20 hours, 1 working 40 hours, doing the same thing, and at the end of the day I give both of them a check for the same amount, I’m showing partiality because I’m not discriminating between the number of hours they worked. Discrimination has sort of become a buzzword in the last few decades to mean the unjust, prejudicial treatment of people based on an immutable characteristic, but the word actually just means “Recognition and understanding of the difference between one thing and another.” That kind of discrimination is essential in a functioning economy. You don’t discriminate based on immutable characteristics, but in a civil society you must discriminate based on behavioral characteristics. If you commit murder, we will treat you differently than if you are a law abiding citizen. That’s discrimination, but it’s fair discrimination. So the issue here isn’t discrimination, it’s injustice. And a lot of people have been and continue to be treated unjustly. But when we’re talking about homosexuality, that isn’t an immutable characteristic, it’s a behavioral one. Nobody is saying we should ban feelings, and if you are attracted to the same gender you should be ostracized. We’re not talking about feelings, we’re talking about the behaviors that arise conjointly with those feelings. You can choose to either act on them or not act on them, the same as nobody is banning anger against another person, what we have laws against is acting on that anger in s gross way like murder or battery. And that’s what we ought to be doing with homosexuality; I’m not saying we should punish people for heart crimes; that would be impossible, and you can’t have the government deciding what’s in another person’s heart in a functioning society. But what we should have laws against is acting on those feelings in a gross way like a man sleeping with another man, as a man sleeps with a woman. It’s disgusting, it’s an abomination, and no human being should be given the allowance to subject himself to such an undignified animalistic behavior. Dignity is what gives us human rights, and when you forfeit that dignity, you forfeit your humanity. Murderers lose their right to pursue happiness, and so should homosexuals. Thank you.

_Its privileged position means that the AV has taken on a symbolic value. Just as everyone loves old English churches, but fewer and fewer go to worship, we cherish the AV, but hardly anyone reads it. A copy of the AV is what every household has, along with a dusty volume of the complete works of Shakespeare._

_This is why the AV is the non-Christian’s version of choice. It allows them to enjoy the language without having to obey the thing. Because, deep down, we want a God with a big white beard and a nice line in Jacobean poetry. We don’t want a God who talks in the language of tradesman’s Greek; a God who sounds like a shopkeeper or a housewife or even a carpenter; we want a God who sounds old and ancient and mysterious. The logical conclusion of this is the mind-bogglingly stupid statement of Charles Allen Dinsmore, who declared the AV to be ‘a finer and nobler literature than the Scriptures in their original tongues.’ As the Cambridge History of the Bible puts it, the AV’s text ‘acquired a sanctity properly ascribable only to the unmediated voice of God.’_

_Why do we love the King James Bible? Why did it come to dominate our culture?_

_Because it sounds better than the original_

Pastor Anderson’s final conviction is that the newer translations “sounded like the voice of a stranger” and that they were “watered down.” I am entirely convinced that Anderson’s conviction, which I can fully relate with, is based on nothing diviner than the eloquent use of Jacabean language in the AV. Steven Anderson shares my frustration to hear the Word of God sound so dumbed-down, but maybe it is we who have frustrated God by “sprucing it up.” This is a book that is confounding to the wise yet revealed to infants, but we have confounded the infants while wise men preach without end.

Pastor Anderson has this day lost my respect and my ear, though I still count him very wise and full of zeal, even as the Pharisees to whom Jesus said, “Whoever blasphemes the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven.” And even as the Spirit spake, pastor Anderson said, “The voice of the devil!” Yea, this man is a blasphemer. I have been deceived by his words which were as smooth as oil to me, though as harsh as iron. God is with us. I pray deeply for you, pastor. You filled my heart with hate, and though I am grateful to know more, I cling to the love of God and his hatred, which he is slow to.

Anderson played on my frustration with the conventional ways of not living for God in the church. With nobody taking the Bible seriously, he did. But in the end, this man would throw me out of his church and disrespect me for believing God in His word. The NASB. The ESV. I refute the tyrant King James.

“You should be a pastor!” “You should be a teacher!” I know what you’re saying, and I take your kindness to heart, I really do, but I say this with the utmost serious ponderence, I am not cut out to be a pastor. I don’t have the inner capacity to be a pastor. When you are given a pulpit, and you have an audience that cheers you on, and affirms your every word, and praises you, there are very severe and subtle temptations to take glory. There was one summer that I spent only 5 days at home; it was my senior year after graduation, and I took trip after trip after trip, whether it was camp, mission trip, DFW Vida Nueva #3, senior retreat, a fireworks job, etc, I remember coming back to Sunday school and my teacher saying, “I think you pretty much took the summer off, Ethan.” But while I was away, I was preaching and praying and taking charge of my words everywhere I went. One example, during Vida Nueva, we had groups that would talk about certain discussions, and we were around a table, and as soon as they ended the prayer, I took charge of my table and initiated everything. I was asking the questions, giving my input, getting the other guys involved, and eventually somebody to the side spoke up, and I looked over and it has a 40 year old man, and that’s when I discovered he was supposed to be the leader. There was actually two leaders, him and an alumni who was training, but I just took over before even realizing it. That’s my arrogance. Our prayer cha pulled me aside and sais, “I can tell God has great things in store for you, but maybe you should ask that quiet kid some questions instead answering them all yourself.” Okay, when we had presentations, everybody looked at me and I marched on those stages and had the audience cheering for our team on the fly. Even at my home church the congregation was loud and interactive during my graduation speech, (which was amazing), but they never did that for our pastor. Everywhere I went there was excitement and synergy, and people clapping and cheering and affirming me, and I think it was because of my age and charisma at that point, and people were telling me, “You should be a pastor!” “You have a gift for speaking!” “You really know your Bible!” “You are a great mentor! Thanks for talking to him.” “You’re making a difference.” but my head got so puffed up … when I went home, my relationship with everybody was good except for one person. My oldest sister. “How arrogant do you think you are to come in my room and try to clean things up? Get off your high horse!” I was just trying to help her. She had a bad day and I crossed a line sorting through her things. But she saw something, underneath my stage humility, there was something deadly. Nobody else ever told my I was prideful. But I went into my room and got on my knees before God and I took her accusations seriously, and that’s when I began to identify the subtlety of pride. And I treated my Bible like a little fortune cookie back then and opened it up saying, “Spirit speak your word to me. Give me instruction.” And I opened it to a place in Psalms that David says, “Put a guard over the door of my mouth.” And there was another place that said, “In a man’s heart he plans his course, but his every step belongs to the Lord.” And I flipped to a passage in James that said, “Only a few should be teachers.” So I finally said, “Okay God. Your will be done.” In my heart I wanted to be a pastor, I wanted to be a teacher, or a speaker, or in some position where I could be recognized for my wisdom. That’s wacked out and twisted, and God said, “No. I will not yield my glory to another.” My heart doesn’t have the capacity to be a pastor, because it is so tainted with pride and selfish praise-seeking tendencies that God slapped me in the face at the end of one summer and I listened, and I will continue to listen. I won’t ignore God. I cannot be in that position of pastor.

I would put a ring on the finger of the person that can tell me what I mean. “Are you serious?” You bet I am. It’s not about finding the perfect person, the “one” that God destined to be with you. I’m not a Calvinist. It’s about finding someone you like and making it work. You compromise, you sharpen one another. Look, everybody loves to say that “People don’t change.” “You can’t change anyone.” That is a lie. People absolutely change. They do. I have had so many people that I have a 10 minute conversation with, an hour long conversation, and they call me _years later_ to tell me, “Bro you changed my life that day.” “I haven’t been doing pornography in over a year.” “You were really right about me. It took awhile, but my family is on good terms with me now.” “God has changed my life ever since you had me read my Bible. I addicted to it now.” And it’s not that in one conversation a light switch just flipped on and “BOOM—changed.” But the direction of their life, the trajectory they are on changes in a moment. Words change people. Jesus is the word and he lives in me, and when you encounter Word, watch out. Everything changes. … This is going to offend you, but I believe it is not a woman’s place to retaliate against her male boss, or husband, or whoever. She is to be respectful. And this is because I believe God when he says that men should rule over the women. I believe Paul when he says that women should be silent in the church. And that’s why this is so offensive to the world, because everybody today is an egalitarian or a feminist; nobody is a complementarian. But I am, because I stand on the Bible. So if women can’t criticize her husband, then men have an _incredible_ burden to make sure that they don’t offend their wives. They have to conduct themselves in a way that Christ would conduct himself toward the church, and that is a major responsibility. If you can’t tell us, we have to be really good at figuring it out ourselves. And most of the time it’s not hard. As soon as you walk away from a conversation that you stepped out of line, you know you stepped out of line. You don’t need your wife to tell you. But sometimes what we do need is a slap in the face to obey our conscience. And therefore I believe men have a duty to each other to constantly be sharpening each other, and edifying each other, and rebuking each other when we’re out of line. Because if women can’t keep men in check, men HAVE to do that job, or else women will step up and fill the gap, and do a man’s job for them because we aren’t. The reason there’s this big thing about equality isn’t for the sake of equality; it’s because men weren’t doing their jobs, so women had to step up and do it for them. The way I go against feminism is not by debating people, I just act like a man and do what we’re supposed to do. If men weren’t such jerks to their female counterparts, I don’t think this movement would have ever happened. Men need to act like men and be decent human beings again. That’s the way I fight it, because if we address the issue from the other end, and get women to submit to their husbands when they’re still being jerks, that doesn’t solve much in the world. That makes it worse. But when you have men, and I believe this is true, when you have men being men, women want to submit to them. I see this all the time in good healthy relationships. Women do submit to their husbands and their happy to when their husbands are treating them right. God said her desire shall be for her husband. Women desire to submit to men. They do. I believe that. The problem is, although men are over woman, according to the Bible women are still over the beast of the field, which is what most of these men act like. No woman has the desire to submit to that. If you want to bring “male superiority” back, be men. Otherwise leave it alone. So get the chemical reaction right. If women submit to bad men, bed men stay bad men. But if bad men are made good men, women submit to them. It’s simple. But not in the real world…just my imagination.

Do you know how many times a day I say, “I made a covenant with mine eyes, why then should I think upon a maid?” “I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes, I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.”? My lust capacities are zero. I need to constantly have God there, “Wack, wack.” His rod and his staff. You say, “Well that’s a good thing. If you’re going to get married, you ought to be a person who fights.” And I agree about that, but each one of those verses is preceded by a moment that I see someone and I like it. And that’s not healthy for a marriage. You see what I’m getting at?

I had a friend who was convicted about his music collection. There was a lot of dark and and sensual music that has incited a lot of sin in his life, and he finally decided, “You know what? I’m going to stop listening to this stuff.” So he went out and bought some cardboard boxes, and he put all his CD’s in them and tapped them and put them in storage. And he told about it, and I said, “That’s great that you’re cutting ties with the things that were causing sin in your life. But if it causes you to sin, why put them in storage? Why not throw them away?” And he said, “Do you know how much money I spent on these CD’s?” We’re talking about a huge collection, hundreds of dollars worth. He said, “I don’t want to have to pay for it all again in case I back slide.” I said, “Listen, those CD’s were expensive, but your holiness was more expensive. Which one are you going to waste? You can have one or the other. You can’t cling to both. And if you keep you sin boxed up in storage, you are making provisions to return to it again. You can’t be doubleminded. You’re either all in, or not at all. You can’t afford to be lukewarm in this life.” And you know what he did? He burned them in this old broken grill he had out back. He didn’t even sell it, because he said, “You know what? You’re right. I’m all in.” And as we were burning them, we sang, “I have decided to follow Jesus. No turning back, no turning back.”

One two, Jesus loves you / Three, four, He is the door, / Five, six, He was crucifix, / Seven, eight, God made a way, / Nine, ten, God saves. Amen!

“Circle of Life.” Whoo! Ladies and gentlemen. That TV screen that we’re all watching is trying to tell us how segregated we are, and how separate we are, and how different we are, and how divided we are. But today you all were a part a something so beautiful; it’s called unity. And no difference in black, white, blue or green, rich, poor, left, right, can break that. We are all a part of something amazing called humanity. When God looked down from Heaven in Genesis 10, he said, “Nothing will be impossible for them as one people.” But they were wicked people, so he divided them. 4000 years later, there was a man named Jesus, he was the Son of God, and one of the last things he said was a prayer to his Father, and he said, “I pray that they might be one, even as we are one.” There is something holy and good and right about all of our voices lifted up as one people, in all of our diversity and differences and culture and individual beauty and talents, that even if you’re not a Christian you can feel it. Let’s not buy in to this notion that we have to be divided. We are the most extrodinary specious on planet earth. Give yourselves a round of applause.

Whatever it is you marry _for_, your marriage will depend of _that_. If you marry for advantage, you’ll divorce for lack of it. If you marry for love, you’ll divorce for lack of it. This topic is very dangerous for _this class_, because it can lead us to cast our thoughts upon a fantasy marriage that isn’t a reality in our life. Because we all have that one person in mind. Right? Maybe it changes from week to week, but you have someone that you have an invisible conversation with when you’re getting ready for work or whatever else. And what can happen is you devote your thoughts to another marriage, a fantasy, that isn’t your true spouse. It’s like a form of pre-adultery. It is breaking wed-lock be virtue of dispersing your heart to many fantasies. And we want to avoid that. So now that we understand caution (we will be cautious), I said it’s a dangerous topic, but it’s also a necessary topic. We need to be prepared with a right understanding of marriage, whether it’s preparing for your future marriage, or your going to be single, but you know married people, and men have a duty to keep each other in line, and women also, so even if you are so Christ-centered and Bible saturated and kingdom-oriented that you don’t plan on splitting your devotion to God with devotion to a partner (and that is a noble thing, a holy thing, a pure and righteous commitment), you still should have a right understanding of marriage, lest you are given the allowance to let the world imprint it’s view of marriage on you that’s distorted and selfish and unholy. So in Matthew 6 Jesus gives us some sound reasoning, where he said build your house on the rock. Don’t build it on the sand. Why? Because sand is changing all the time, right? It isn’t a firm foundation, and if that which the house depends on shifts, the house falls down. So right there from Matthew 6 we see that whatever marriage depends on, it should be constant and unchanging. I watched Cinderella, and at the end his father says to Kit, his son, “Kit, you must not marry for advantage, you must marry for love.” And I walked awayf rom that movie thinking, “Yeah, because if you marry for advantage, you’ll divorce for lack of it.” And then I watched it a second time, and my neighbors were getting a divorce, and it was because they didn’t love each other anymore. And I thought, “You know what? Don’t marry for love either, because if you marry for love, you’ll divorce for lack of it.” And you’re saying, “Oh but love is unconditional. It’s a rock. Agape.” Blah, blah blah. But wait, that love is for everybody, not just married people. 1 Corinthians 13 applies to everyone, not just your spouse. And you don’t marry someone because you love them unconditionally. I hope not. Then we would just get married to anyone, without conditions. Unconditionally means, “It isn’t because of who you are that I love you, but because of who I am.” Not because of who you are. That takes every condition off the table. That’s not why we get married, and that is a terrible foundation for marriage, because it doesn’t rule out anyone, but God abominates unconditional marriage. For example, you shall not lie with a man as with a woman. That’s a condition from God. Different genders. Agape has nothing to do with marriage, and it’s not the foundation of it. People don’t get married to people they love unconditionally, they get married for people they love sexually. It is a kind of love that depends of the sexual attraction between two genders. (Hopefully two genders, anyway. If there’s some wonky gender dysphoria or twisted evolutionary problem with your brain so that you are attracted to the same gender, God might have given you up to a debased mind. A reprobate mind.) It depends on a romanticism that has it’s roots not in logical cognition or choices we make to love someone, but in a real, hormonal bond that exists because you are attracted to each other, and if you were different genders, you wouldn’t be. So it’s sexual attraction. That can’t be your foundation for marriage either. Here’s why: That kind of love fluctuates in and out. And there can be seasons of fluctuations. Little arguments that you absolve before the sun goes down, most people can deal with. But when there comes seasons of hardness of heart, and bitterness of soul, if your marriage depends on that love, it depends on shifting sands, because it is not constant. If you marry for sexual attraction, you will divorce for lack of it. And there will be a lack of it in the course of 60 years. Charm is deceitful, and beauty is fleeting, says Bathsheba. So what’s the secret? Look for a girl dressed in scarlet. That is, you have to look for people who are clothed with salvation, and qualities that get better with time instead of absolving with time. That’s just a little pro tip from Solomon’s mom, but it’s not the foundation. So what is the foundation?

Somebody go to Genesis 1, and someone else go to Daniel. Does anybody have a Hebrew interlinear? Read that Hebrew word for us. What’s its definition? And now read the one in Daniel. What’s it’s definition? Hmm… So In Genesis, it says, “side.” Interesting… Why do you think I’m pointing that out? I want you to think about Jesus. What animal does God use to describe him? A lamb, right? God uses the most vulnerable animal on the planet to talk about his son. Somebody turn to Isaiah. He calls him the lion of Judah. Lion, lamb. Same person. In God there is a meekness and gentleness and softness, and in the same God there is a fierceness and terror and strength. - What do you think image means? Physical manifestation? A wax imprint? A functional attribute? – I submit to you that when God took a side of Adam and created eve, he took away the feminine attributes that are necessary to fully display the image of God. God created Adam in his image, and then he split that image in two, so that now they both represent one half of the character of God. Lion, lamb. So there is a way in which marriage allows you to more fully represent the image of God, and it’s beautiful and holy, and when it happens, life comes out of it. Because that’s who God is. So that’s reason number one.

I saw that in my heart one summer, and I went before God and said, “God, I don’t mean to mistreat your word as though it were a fortune cookie, but I need to know what you want me to do, whether I should pursue this course of teaching and being heard, or if I should cease from it.” And I opened my book to the Psalm that said, “Put a guard over the door of your mouth.” And I said, “Okay. Now that I’ve been so bold to speak one time, do not get angry, but peradventure that it was a coincidence, confirm your charge once more.” And I turned over to a passage in James that said, “Few should be teachers.” And that is where my eyes immediately snapped to. It isn’t like I was in that general area and came across it. So I said, “Okay God. I will obey you.” So now I don’t teach so that I’m not this arrogant jerk that thinks he knows everything.

I have a general schedule for every week that’s my template, and then I make little modifications every night for the next day, so that I always have something planned for the day that I’m in. If you want to tap into my time, tell me before I make my nightly schedule modifications for the next day. I try to be flexible, but if you want to ensure I’ll have time for your project, tell me at least a day in advance.

“Easy Believism” is the Lordship Salvationists way of trying to make our doctrine sound foolish, but actually I like it. Because Jesus said my burden is light an the way is easy. When these people draw emphasis to the fact that believing is too “easy” to be enough for salvation, it only makes their false doctrine of “hard repentism” contrast even more sharply as the lie that it is. “You don’t have to work to get saved, but if you don’t work you’re not saved.” Isn’t that just saying the same thing? But I get it. The Lordship Salvationist will say, “The causal relationship between works and salvation are reversed. Works don’t save you. Belief leads to salvation, and once you have salvation you start to work because now you have the Holy Spirit.” And so they think they can use this quasi-mathematical formula to figure out if people are saved. It’s really like a syllogism: (1) whosoever believes on the Lord Jesus is saved. (2) Whosoever is saved receives the Holy Spirit. (3) Whosoever receives the Holy Spirit is born again. (4) Whosoever is born of God doesn’t make a practice of sinning. (5) You committed fornication this week. (5) Committing fornication is a sin. (6) Therefore, you are not saved. (7) Therefore, you do not believe on the Lord Jesus.

(7) necessarily follows from premises (1) and (6), and (6) necessarily follows from premises (4) and a generalized version of (5) whereby you make a practice of sinning. If all the premises are true, the conclusions necessarily follow, right? So are any of the premise false? The problem I have with the Lordship salvationists string of logic is premise (4). “Whosoever is born of God doesn’t make a “practice” of sinning. A “practice” of sinning? What does that means? “Well, they don’t do a habitual sin, like being a drunkard or looking at pornography or living a promiscuous life.” “So they can do little one-time isolated sins? Like lying? Or steeling a pen?” “Yeah—whoever is born of God is still going to have some sin. Just not habitual repeated sinning.” That’s a cool interpretation. The problem I have with it is that it’s false. Whoever is born of God cannot commit sin period. Not even the little one-time isolated incidents. It is very interesting that the exact same word, same verb tense that the ESV translators rendered, “practice,” in 1 John 3 in order to convey a sense of habitual repeatedness was translated by the 47 scholars who translated the King James Version as “commit.” I Guess they were all wrong. There’s also the minor point that the ESV translators translated it normal in every other instance where the word is used. I guess they were wrong in all of those passages too. No, because the fact is that whoever is born of God cannot commit any sin. And even if you think “practice of sinning” is a good translation, it doesn’t matter, because in verse 9 John says, “And he cannot sin, because he is born of God.” Jesus said no good tree brings forth corrupt fruit. The doctrine that the Lordship Salvationists overlook is the doctrine of the new man vs. the old man. Jesus said of those born of woman, no one is greater than John the Baptist; but the least in the Kingdom Of God is greater than him. Are you really going to tell me that you, being an hair of the kingdom, live your life is a greater way than John the Baptist? Because according to Jesus, if you’re kingdom bound, than you are. That’s a misunderstanding of 1 John 3. No one born of God commits sin, and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. He says it again in Chapter 5. As a Bible believing Christian, you can’t escape that. So now if we’ve established that no one born of God commits sin, and we all have sin, how is anybody saved? The answer is in Romans 7, verses 17 and 20: “As it is, it is no more I that do it, but sin living in me.” When you sin, it isn’t your new man who is born of God, it is your fleshy old man who is being corrupted according to the lusts of deceit. So what is John saying in Chapter 3? He’s saying that we have hope. Verse 4. And that one day we will be like unto him, because we will see him just as he is. … The problem is the inductive glue between with premise (4) and (6). It doesn’t follow that because you are saved, you will stop sinning. The confusion is implanted in what I mean when I say **_you_** will still sin. As an entity, you are the collective body of soul, body, and spirit. This is the doctrine of dualism. There are two basic advocates of dualism: dualists and trichotimists. The dualist believes that your person is made up of your body and spirit (brain and soul), while the trichotomist also makes a distinction between the soul and the spirit, as well as the body. Generally “dualism” is used loosely to talk about the distinction between the mind and the brain, so somebody who says, “I am a dualist,” may very well be a trichotomist. Even if you are a trichotomist, it would not be inappropriate to use dualist language. According to the trichotomist, you are comprised of three very distinct elements of personhood: body, soul, and spirit. And all of these parts interact with each other to produce **decisions**. At the core of what makes you, well, you, is the decisions you make. And when John says, “He that is without out sin deceives himself and the truth is not in him,” the pronoun “he” is linked to a “you” that is comprised of all these elements. Because you as an entity will never be without sin until the redemption of your body. But when John goes on to talk about “He that is born of God,” he does not at all mean “you” in the same sense, hence the clarification “Born of God.” Because before you were born again, you still had a body, a soul, and a dead spirit. And when you were born again, your body didn’t die, your soul didn’t die, but your spirit was finally birthed by the sperm of God’s word. Your Spirit was inside the womb, dead for all intents and purposes, and God made you alive. That part of you, this new man, this new spirit, cannot sin, because he is born of God. So there a many different ways you can talk about “you.”: As the 3 elements of your person (the combined interaction between all three parts that produce **net** decisions), the old man (the **gross** sum of your sinful nature’s influence on your net decisions), and the new man (the gross sum of your holy nature’s influence on your net decisions). Your soul (conscience), whatever it is grounded in, is produced by all three elements. Does the spirit think? Does the brain think? These are difficult questions for us to know, but I speculate that your soul is your conscience (the part of “you” that processes thoughts, words, etc), and your two natures (body and spirit) are at enmity with each other, both influencing what your soul thinks about. Think about it, every thought you have is preceded by an urge or a feeling or something else. What kinds of things did you think about before you could talk or understand language? In Module ___ I have created a decision model that attempts to quantify what causes us to make decisions. What causes us to think? Even the young child has a natural impulse of promiscuity. He will get an erection when confronted with a sexual stimulus, even before he has any knowledge about intercourse. If you hit your hand, you might think, “Ouch!” So we see that the body can cause us to have thoughts. Or, if you’re laying in bed pondering the mysteries of the universe, you might think something philosophical, “Why do I exist?” What causes that thought? Your limbic system might light up, “Cookie!” But then your prefrontal lobes take over, “Now wait a minute, we’ll be better off if we eat a carrot.” Your thoughts are very heavily influence by the brain, and chemicals in the brain, but that’s just one part. There is also the Spirit. There’s also things we think about that simply cannot be ultimately reducible to the brain. … The point is that it doesn’t follow necessarily that you (as a three-part entity with two natures) will stop sinning because you add on a holy nature to a previously existing entity that still has a sinful nature. What does follow is that when we shed our sinful nature (by dying) we will no longer sin. But until that time, whatever is born of God cannot sin (the new man) and whatever is born of flesh cannot please God (the old man), and you (as a three-part entity whose individual components contribute to your net decision threshold) will sometimes live pleasing to God (when you walk in the spirit) and sometimes sin (when you walk in the flesh). You will walk by the spirit when the gross influence of your spirit is greater than the gross influence of your flesh, producing a net decision pleasing to God. You will walk by the flesh when the gross influence of your flesh outweighs the gross influence of you spirit, resulting in a net decision of sin. So it simply is not the case that because one part of your being cannot sin, that the net sum of your thoughts and decisions will never result in sin.

“Well then, should I go on sinning?” No. In Romans 6, Paul doesn’t actually create a list of pros and cons. “One the one hand, sin will result in more grace, and it feels good. But on the other hand, God will punish us on this earth for it.” No, he say, “By no means,” and then goes on to talk about putting our old self to death. Did you know you can do that? Put your old sinful nature to death? Yep. You can. Paul gives us many strategies to help us make our spirit the dominant nature in the entity that is “you.” He says, “Don’t leave it to chance, where some days your flesh is dominant, and some days your spirit is dominant. Make no provision for the flesh!” There are ways to starve the old sinful nature so that it’s power slowly diminishes, and is reinstated to the spirit. But realize that your sinful nature is like a weed, whereas your new nature needs to be nourished constantly to keep it growing, your old nature just grows automatically, and the reason is because it has no roots. Jesus said man cannot live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. Your old nature, though, doesn’t need bread to grow. It doesn’t need water and sunlight, and the goldy-lock conditions to grow; it springs up like a weed and overtakes you, but the good thing about it is that because it grows without roots, it’s easy to kill it. Your sinful decisions are not grounded in deep thought, and ponderous, and weighing out pros and cons. It springs up out of impulses and urges and moments that you act before thinking. And that’s why when you’re rooted in the Bible and in God’s word, over time your new nature is much stronger than your flesh. Because you are grounded on the rock of Christ, deep though, deep convictions, deep faith; nothing can move you! But it will never happen if your don’t nourish it. Your new nature needs bread to grow. Milk and meet. So don’t neglect your daily bread, and sitting at the feet of Jesus to hear his word and grow in faith daily, because if you don’t, you will live in the flesh. It may as well be a coin toss, and let me tell you something: the coin is weighted to land sin-up. So Romans 6 isn’t Paul saying, “Here’s why you shouldn’t sin:” It’s really him saying, “Bro, here’s how not to sin: reckon your flesh dead.” It’s him saying, “Don’t you recognize that that sinful impulse that is in you isn’t really you? He died to you! By virtue of you being united with Christ, you have excommunicated your sinful nature. You’re at war with one another! Don’t give him the smallest chance to get the upper hand, because he will make you a slave to him if you don’t take steps to get the upper hand. Should you sin? No way! It’s not even your desires—it’s sin that’s living in you. It’s like asking if you should let your home be infested with cockroaches. At one point, you were living in cockroaches, but then you died to them, you excommunicated them, you made them your enemy, you made a decision to say, “I’m not going to just let you crawl all over me and be happy about it, I’m going to kill you,” but they are still in your house, and here are strategies to dwindle their numbers. That’s the way I read Romans 6. “You’re dead to sin.” It’s like saying to a wayward son, “You’re dead to me.” “Should I let him in?” Paul’s reminding you, “He’s dead to you. That’s why you shouldn’t let him in. Even though God’s grace will increase if you do, don’t do it.” Jesus came to cause division, to make people dead to themselves. He came to bring a sword. Don’t go to bed without blood on it.

, they translated normally in every other instance where it is used.

 First of all, the 47 scholars to translated the King James Version rendered it “doth not commit sin,” not “does not make a practice of sinning.” John Goes on to say in verse 9,

“But wait a minute, John said just two chapters ago that if we say we’re without sin we deceive ourselves and the truth in not in us.” “Well,

My answer is no, none of the premises are false. However, premise 4 is misunderstood, and because it is misunderstood, (6) does not follow.

A lot of people accuse Lordship salvationists of compromising with a works salvation doctrine, but they will be the first to tell you that is not true. “Lordship salvation,” interestingly enough, has very little to do with soteriology. It is actually concerned with identifying who _is_ saved, rather than how to _get_ saved. As far as getting saved, the lordship salvationists are identical to easy believism, so I don't think saying they are a twisted version of salvation by works is a fair criticism. I do think it is a very dangerous false doctrine, though, because it dances very closely with people doubting their salvation when they are saved. When I was struggling with assurance of salvation, if there was anything that was an obstacle to my faith, it was lordship salvation, not God’s grace. Because what lordship salvation can do is strip your intellectual faith in God of is emotional and experiential qualities. It causes belief to die in your heart, and you get depressed and unstable and because you aren't grounded in the assurance that God's promises are extended to you, the only comfort available is sin. That was my experience anyway. Lordship salvation kept me from coming boldly before the throne of grace to commune with my Father, and once you lose that you lose everything. You fall into a season of sin because you have no joy anchoring you in Christ. You need to abide to defeat sin, and you can't do that from a place of hopelessness. The only way to do that is to recognize that you are safe already. And no matter what you can trust God. It's like getting a woman to orgasm. The only way she can do it is if she is relaxed because she trusts her partner. You are the woman, and your orgasm is living a righteous life. You need to be totally comfortable with yourself and have total trust in God if you want to live a righteous life, and lordship salvation gets in the way of that big league. Lordship pressures the girl, “Okay—you have to orgasm! You don't know if your partner will accept you until you orgasm. I mean—the only way to orgasm is if you are with your partner; you can’t work for it, it just comes naturally and there's nothing you can do except have sex with your partner, but if you don't orgasm, you can't have certainty that you’re his wife. So make sure you orgasm because you pleasing him depends on it!” She’ll never orgasm that way. We have to know who we are and whose we are, or we’ll always live with fear of being rejected by God, and we can't live right in that place because “thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on three, because he trusts thee.” But you can’t trust God if you don’t think his promises apply to you, and if you don’t trust God, you don’t have peace, and you never will. So this doctrine of lordship salvation is very grievous to me, but the only thing that really matters is whether or not is true. Because it can be dangerous and still be true. So let's look at the Bible. – this is one of those,  “nothing is taboo for Ethan” kind of episodes, so hide your wife, hide your kids, hide you dog, hide your parents’ bug that’s in your room by your bedside that you don't know about ….(one eye leaning in look)

So don’t believe these lordship salvationists who say, “You don’t know that you’re his wife until you orgasm. And you can’t fake it! You have to do it naturally by getting him all up in you.” Nope, sorry. Because that’s not the basis of my marriage. That’s not the basis of my hope in Christ. If you look over here, there’s a document called the New Covanant, and it’s signed by the blood of Jesus. I can orgasm or not and it’s not going to matter, because it’s already a done deal. I can do works by my relationship with Christ or not, but my sonship doesn’t depend on that. I’ve been regenerated (from the word genes). And for those of you who are upset that Paul calls you “sons” when you are women (to indicate that you have an inheritance in the kingdom), us men are the bride of Christ. There are all kinds of parablistic illistrations, and you can’t push them so far that you get this wonky sense of gender dysphoria. It’s just a metaphor to get his point across.

John Piper makes a “no true scottsmen” argument, and uses an illustration that if you pronounce a certain word this way then you are a southerner. Pronouncing the word that way doesn’t make you a southerner, but being a southerner makes you pronounce it that way (Hebrews).

So in Olive Tree there was this super amazing deal on a King James collection, that included everything from concordences to commentaries to Greek and Hebrew dictionaries, and it was $19.99. And I have another app on my phone called Google rewards that sends my surveys, and when I complete them it adds credit to my Google play account. I found the deal on Olive Tree mid January 2017, when I had just over $20.00 in my account, but when I tried to purchase it I received an error, because I was about a $1.40 short with tax. I had been waiting about a month, hoping the sale would last and that the item wouldn’t go back up to $65.95. I figured, “Maybe they will have a 10% off coupon on Valentines day (the 14th).” So I waited and waited, but didn’t quite have enough. Monday morning on the 13th of February I went out running, and instead of listening to music I listened to Psalm 51, Psalm 6, and then some hymns. And it occurred to me while I was listening to hymns, “Aha! I finally know how Mr. Lynn is always so Spirit-filled! He’s always thanking God. He has a thankful heart. He’s always singing songs and hymns and spiritual songs, and making melody with his heart to the Lord.” So I came home having hymns in my heart and began to make fried oats, when my sister came down and talked about her running goals and problems. Usually I’m very stoic with my sister, but that day I was happy and cheerful. She went on up stairs, and a minute later Deborah cried out, “Ahh! … Uhh, the faucet is broken. Can you help?” So I asked her to tend to the fried oats and she happily took over while I went in to fix it. When I went in their, the faucet was puring our water from the bottom of the “Warm” handle, so I turned it a little bit and the pressure popped it off and water came gushing out all over, soaking the walls, pictures, and it began to flood and go into the carpet. Yikes! Dad came down from his office up stairs and took told be to shut the water off from outside since the one under the sink was stuck. Soon the water was off, and we had to dry everything off. When I went back out to turn the water on again, Deborah commenting, “I like your music, Ethan!” It was “Shall we gather at the river?” It was just a fun adventure, but if you’re not at a place of thankfulness, it will ruin your day. So I was soaked, but urgency takes priority over importance, so I went to finish making my breakfast when I realized I was 3 Tablespoons short of honey. Then Mom told me we had more in the pantry. “Praise be!” I sat down to eat breakfast, when my dad said, “Surely Ethan’s going with me to Home Depot?” And I said, “Of course!” What you need to understand about me is that I have a rejection mentality. Some people have a problem with saying “Yes” too much; I have a problem with saying “no” too much. So I caught myself saying yes, and it was like I had a new nature. I finished breakfast and went to Home Depot, where we bought some things to fix the faucet. And we did. After the work and cleanup was done, I received a survey about my visit to Home Depot, which credited my account $0.43 and enabled my to buy the KJV collection! What we need to understand is that when we delight ourselves in the Lord, he gives us the desire of our hearts. I wasn’t expecting to be able to purchase the collection this soon, and I would’ve had a thankful heart that day anyway. But from a place of thankfulness, God poured out his blessing on me, and said, “You think it ends here? Watch this.” So I ran downstairs and told my dad, because I told him about the predicament I was in during our drive to Home Depot. I say all this so that we can remember the things that God does for us. In Exodus, God frequently makes provisions for Israel to not forget the mighty works of God. Whether it’s Passover or putting manna in a jar, us remembering God’s blessings and knowing that he’s with us is very significant to God.

Thou wilt shew me the paths of life; in thy presence there are pleasures for evermore. But all who go to _her_ house return not again, neither do they reach the paths of life. You see, we go to her house to get pleasure, not realizing that pleasure is in the house of God.

Evolutionarily speaking… “I’m not talking about speciation, I’m talking about adaptation and preservation.” “I can’t beat this evolutionary instinct to produce offspring!” The reason I grew this beard is to stop all the ladies from constantly throwing themselves at me. Because, man, me with stubble and good hair… talk about irresistible gloriousness! Haha. Just kidding. But I did have a problem, and that problem was the combination of eligibility and trust. In case you don’t know, the biggest turn on for women is trust. “Do you trust me?” And so when I went to Collin College, I brought with me two people, the man born of God who cannot sin, and the first man born of flesh who’s like, “Mmm hmm.” And so I had these two separate natures, and the man born of God, the new nature, made everybody trust me, because… Jesus. You know, I was there for you, I would help you, I was being kind to everybody, and I had a spirit of wisdom from God. I knew the material, everyone thought I was smart and funny and kind, but the bottom line was that they all trusted me. The Spirit of God connects on the deepest level with the spirits of other people. And so my natural self was constantly tempting me to capitalize on the trust that my new man had gained me. “Send me a pic.” “I want you on your knees baby.” And they would’ve done it, not because I was the best looking person in the world, but because they trusted me, and I was at least fathomably okay in the realms of physical attraction. And so I grew my beard out to eliminate the eligibility aspect of it. The reason that my beard communicates, “NOT ELIGIBLE” on a subconscious evolutionary level is because the way a person gets a red beard without red hair is if your 16th chromosome (MC1R) is mutated to produce pheomelanin (red colors) as well as eumelanin (the darker colors). Mutated chromosome = deal breaker for your evolutionary instincts to find a suitable partner. So my beard is, in essence, is an insecurity for my first nature, the old man, the one that likes to sin, so that I don’t have the mentality, “If I want her, I can have her.” And it’s been working too. The ladies used to be really coquettish with me in college, and try and be subtle over text messages and whatnot, it was actually kind of funny. But Since I grew out my beard, nothing. Which is a testament to how amazingly ingenious I am, and humble too.

People like to call me exceptional. I’m not. I’m just an excrescence of what is exceptional: our teachers.

Listen, because this is important. Jesus did not die so that when you sin, you would say, “Oh… No one born of God sins. God, please, please, please, don’t reject me.” Jesus died so that when you sin, you look to him for justification and not yourself. What does that look like? If you look to yourself for justification, you can’t please God. It’s impossible. Sorry. If, when you sin, you have a mentality that your right standing with God depends on you performing well, you will be a radically insecure person. But the whole reason for the law, for the cross, for everything God has been doing in human history is to get us to repent from idolatry. You say, “Why idolatry?” Because when you look to anything but God to do for you what only God can do for you, whatever you are looking at is your god. And let me tell you something, only God can make give you right standing before him. Only God can justify you, and the whole point of the law and the cross is to get you to recognize that. It’s to get you to repent from looking to yourself for salvation, from looking at your performance for justification, so that when you sin, you don’t hide yourself from him like Adam and Eve did. So that when you sin you don’t wallow in shame and guilt and condemnation. That’s idolatry. You are making yourself your own god when you base your justification on your own performance. That was the first sin humanity every committed, when Satan said, “You can be like God. To a greater extent then he already made you like him.” It was idolatry. It was Adam putting in the place of God himself, just like Lucifer tried to do when he said, “I will ascend.” Listen, if you base your right standing with God on how good of a person you are in life, you won’t please God that way, because you are your own god. You’re making yourself a substitute for the cross, and there is no substitute for the cross. Look, thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on God. When you sin, you can’t afford to say, “Oh, wretched man that I am. Woe is me.” You’re looking at yourself. You won’t have peace that way because peace comes from a mind that is stayed, that is set, that is unwavering on God. Jesus died so that when you sin, you won’t look at yourself and say, “Oh wretched man that I am,” and your hope won’t shift to the right or the left, but it will be set fully on the grace to be given us when Jesus Christ is revealed. That’s where peace comes from, and the second you step out of that, you will live in depression. You say, “Why not say, ‘Wretched man that I am?’ Paul said it.” Yeah he did, but in the same breath he said, “Who will set me free from this body of death? Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord!” He’s focused! His hope is not wavering. I am not saying you shouldn’t recognize that you have a problem. I am not saying you should never say “Wretched man that I am.” I _am_ saying you should never say, “Wretched man that I am,” and end it there. I _am_ saying you should never say, “Wretched man that I am,” without a heart of thankfulness for what Jesus has done, so that when you sin you won’t say, “What if… what if… what if…” there is no what if, there’s only the promises of God. When Paul calls out his sinful nature (and it’s good to do that), he doesn’t let his gaze shift there. His mind is stayed on God, so that even when he takes the time to recognize that yes, he still sins, his hope doesn’t waver from the work of Jesus and the promises of God. That’s where peace comes from, and without it, you’ll never know peace. Because you’ll always be looking at yourself, and your performance fluctuates. You’ll be an up and down kind of Christian. Mountains and valleys. Mountains and valleys. “I’m doing good! I’m on top of the world! I’m really close with God now! … Oh, I can’t believe I sinned. Wretched man that I am! I’m so far from God.” That’s not peace. Peace is a level ground. Peace is your life grounded on a rock, and the rock is Jesus. And if you build on the shifting sands of your performance, you’ll never have security. It’ll always be seasons of joy followed by seasons of agonizing depression. And it’ll just keep cycling around and around until you die and realize, “I was making myself my own god.” Yeah, arrows are flying at you all day long, but do you know what will extinguish them? Paul tells us in Ephesians 6: it’s the shield of faith. Faith in Christ alone to be our savior, and not anything we’ve done or will do or will stop doing. We can’t afford to step away from that. Jesus died so that when you sin, you will say, “God, I’ve sinned. I’ve stepped over the line again, but I thank you that Jesus died for this very reason, so that when I sin, I’m not in a place of idolatry, and I’m not alienated from God anymore. You are as close as my next breath. You say that if we confess our sins, Christ is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. So I confess my sins to you right now, with my hope set in Jesus and not myself. I don’t have any security because I am a great person. All of my confidence is placed in my great high priest, in Jesus who mediates for me, and it’s because of him that I come boldly before the throne of grace, that I might obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need. If my boldness depended on my own lived-out righteousness, I would be alienated from your house forever. But my hope and trust is in you, the only true God, and no one can do for themselves what Christ has done for them. Help me to live out the righteousness Christ has imputed to me, little by little, until that glorious day when we will be changed in the twinkling of an eye. My heart is heavy with my sin, Father, and I hate living a life that is displeasing to you. But I know that the only thing we can do to please you is to trust in Jesus, so I come, engrossed with my own sin, with a heavy heart because of it, with my hope set fully on Jesus. Hope is the bridge that casts my burdens on Jesus. I praise you that his yoke is light, and the way is easy. You are a good, good Father. In Jesus name, amen.” … There is a worldy remorse that leads to regret, but there also a godly remorse that leads to repentance, like it did for Paul in Romans 7. Did you see how he went for recognizing his sin to hoping in Jesus? That’s repentance. Repentance is when the recognition of your sin drives you to trust in Jesus to do what only Jesus can do, and not ourselves. A lot of people think repentence means to turn away from your sin. And it does, but the sin you’re turning away from is idolatry, it’s trusting yourself to do for yourself what only God can do for you. The emphasis of repentance, my mentor would always tell me, is not turning away from sin, but turning to God. I can turn from one sin to another sin, but when I turn to God, when I fix my gaze on him, and stay my mind on his promises, that’s repentance, because by default, the sin of being my own god is behind me if the true God is in front of me. This is the gospel.

So, if you are like me, you caught several items in my post that I didn’t provide a lot of support for, and that was for the sake of time, but if you are more meticulous with searching the scriptures to see if it matches up, like the Beareans (high five, that’s a good thing), check out my arguments in the description for the doctrine I just presented.

I am not opposed to a moderate amount of TV for children, and it’s because the Bible expects us to already know certain things before we can understand it. When I was explaining two different interpretations of Hebrews 12:1 to my 10 year old sister, I began by explaining what a the word “witness” means and different ways it can be used. When I said, “If you’re an eye-witness, that means that you saw something happen. So if I called you into a courtroom and called for an eye-witness, that means you would…” and she cut me off and said, “Like Bobby and Cindy when they spilled ice-cream on each other.” And I thought, “Yes! She’s getting it!” So we see that an episode of the Brady Bunch enabled my sister to better understand a passage from the Bible. And we used the Brady Bunch to do exegesis on Hebrews 12:1 before we went back to Hebrews 11 and determined that we think the “cloud of witnesses” means “examples” of people who trusted God, and it worked. Not people who are witnesses of us, cheering us on in the race, but people who in a courtroom would give their testimony, “I trusted God, and it worked!” and are testaments to us about the faithfulness of God. (I promise I did not coerce her into my interpretation. Her rationale was, “Yeah, because if they were watching us they would see us naked like every day.” Ha ha.) It’s fun to watch how we interpret the Bible in the early stages of our life. And just as TV can be an asset, it is more likely to be a danger in distorting the way we see the Bible, so I do not use the word “moderate” loosely. Moderate, censored, and monitored. Make sure your know what your kids are picking up from culture. Caillou gives the impression that it’s okay to sound winey. I do not recommend it.

I’ve noticed the times I learn the most are when I have to start from the ground up to explain the Bible to my little sister. Some of the biggest epiphanies I’ve had were things I already knew, that I had to explain to a 10 year old. Just because it’s in your head doesn’t mean you’ve really thought through it in a way that’s totally understandable.

Dualism – “Nor does it yield much satisfaction to understand the "three measures of meal" of that threefold division of our nature into "spirit, soul, and body," alluded to in 1Th 5:23, or of the threefold partition of the world among the three sons of Noah (Ge 10:32), as some do.”

“I am not writing a commentary.” I have to preach this to myself every time I do my Bible readying on Olive Tree. If I was to read 100 words per minute, it should take me 20 minutes everyday to get through the Bible in one year (or 26 minutes a day to get through it in 300 days if you’re doing the Discipleship Reading Plan). My problem is I have all the resources to attempt finding an answer to my questions, and I have questions for nearly every verse. I can spend 2 hours of my morning on 10 verses. I can’t keep up this rate lest time should fail me, and I liken myself to the foolish man who hears these words and does not act on them. The truth is, I’ve already heard all of these words. Twice. None of them are a stranger to me. But I strongly desire for myself to study it this one last time, and after I am through, I will just read, having all my notes and thoughts and questions already sorted out, allowing myself time to act on them. As it is, I do only what is necessary and no more. What soil is this, which demands seed every year and produces no crop at all? I am fruitless. Yet I also know the parable of the bamboo nut, which after being in water 5 years takes 90 days to grow 90 feet. This is my hope for myself—that I am in water now, awaiting to take root downward and bear fruit upward. I remember Jesus, who said, “Wait until the Holy Spirit is upon you.” But I am like John’s disciples, who said, “We do not know if the Holy Spirit was given.”

Probabilities that deal strictly with numbers fail to account for intelligent causes (that is, factors that extend beyond the realm of what science can observe, being nature and nothing more). For example, I have on my phone an app called Scripture Typer, where I type the first letters of a given sequence of words (a bible verse). The probability of getting a 14 word sequence correct is very low (there are ______ possible ways to arrange 26 letters in 14 spaces), but I get them correct nearly every time. Because what probability can’t account for is the biggest deviances from nature that is common to our everyday lives: the mind. … the probability of me typing that sequence correctly is higher than the probability of an unguided (that is, without a mind) machine, program, or the like getting it correct, but not statistically speaking. Statistics can’t quantify the nuerological pathways in my brain that allow me to punch in the sequence in a non-random fashion. Statistics depend on absurdity. And that’s stupid. That is the reason I get frustrated in Star Wars when one of those droids is constantly saying, “The probability of us getting out of here alive is 1 in 376,000,” blah, blah, blah. You know why they make it out alive every time? Because there is a pilot flying the ship, not random forces that would just as likely lead the ship in any of the other 375,999 possible courses that would make you end up dead. The only answer to the fine tuning of the universe is if there’s a mind behind it. Natural causes are random. Intelligent causes are aren’t.

People need to get excited about celibacy and singleness. Too many people get married, and it makes me angry because they’re not even doing it right. But what makes me even angrier is that they just completely ignore Paul’s personal advice in 1 Corinthians 7. He said, “Look, if your’re not married, stay that way because it’s going to spare you grief, it’s going to spare you pain, and it’s going to free up your time to preach the word of the gospel to those that are perishing. We have the most urgent message in the world, people’s eternity is at stake, and we don’t need to be using our time figuring out how to please our spouses and look after little goo goo.” But he goes on to make sure we know, “Don’t get married, _unless you burn with passion_, because it’s better for you to get married than to sin. And getting married is not a sin. No way. But it can keep you from sin if you can’t control that obsolete primitive bodily instinct to produce offspring and keep our species alive. We don’t need that instrinct anymore, the earth is plenty populated.” And what we’re not grasping as singles, is that it’s not a sacrifice to stay single and preach the word. It’s and exchange of an earthly reproduction to an heavenly reproduction. What is the marriage bed? It’s the planting of your seed to be fruitful and multiply. What is evangelism? It’s the planting of spiritual seed to so that we are fuitful and multiply after our kind. And what is our kind? Child of God. We are inserting the sperm of God, the word of God into the world to produce his children. To regenerate corrupted flesh (from the word genes). Singleness is a step up from marriage. You’re not missing out on anything, you’re exchanging it for something trancendant. The spiritual things of God are always better than the fleshly things of the world. And just as the wedding ring is nothing compared to the marriage bed, the marriage bed is nothing compared to the pleasure we will have in Christ when we are changed in the twinkling of an eye. Just look ahead a little further, and you will see that this thing is glorious, and it’s better, far better, to be single than to be married. And that’s what 1 Corinthians 7 is all about. But he says, if you can’t accept that, if you can’t set your mind on the things of God such that your earthly evolutionary instinct to reproduce loses power, get a wife. Let him who thinks he standeth take heed lest he fall. If you can’t get your mind off the things of the world, the temporal pleasures of the world, the cute little glory of marriage, than you will end up acting on those lusts, and it’s better to act on them in such a way that brings glory to God rather than glory to the devil. Because marriage, when it’s done right, is the closest parable we have to our relationship with Christ, and that’s a beautiful, glorious thing. So if you burn with passion, be joined with a wife, come together in such a way as to shew forth the fullness of God’s image and glory, and walk according to the example of Christ and the church so that the world will see it and know God’s inceesnt unfailing love for us when we tell them the gospel. But if you can receive this word, and if you can put away that fleshly impulse, and if you can put your body under subjection and be filled with the Spirit such that you make no provision for the flesh, and those burning passions lose their power because your mind is stayed on God, don’t _settle_ down, rise up. Walk in all the fullness of Christ. Don’t allay the fullness of what Christ has purchased for you. Don’t settle for less then knowing the riches of Christ in you. Count all things as loss in view of the, watch this, _surpassing value_ of knowing Christ. That’s the treasure. That’s what’s worth it. That’s what I meant when I said, “trancedant,” earlier. The suprassing value of knowing Christ. Don’t pick a dinner of vegitables when you can have a table of meet. There is something that is lost in marriage, because you have to devote yourself to each other in such a way that part of your energy goes to pleasing each other, and that takes you away from the transcendent calling. And you say, “Well I can do both.” Look, this isn’t me talking, it’s Paul talking. And I think he’s right. Because you can say, “Well she’s going to push me closer to God.” But she’s also going to keep you from him. Because you’re concearned about worldy things. And marriage is a worldly thing, because it’s till death do we part. Jesus said there is not marriage in heaven. You don’t take it with you. You spend a lifetime building something that goes away the minute you’re separated. Marriage isn’t a spiritual thing. If it was, it would last outside the body. But the two shall become one spirit? No, the two shall become one flesh. And it’s the same flesh that cannot please God. It’s the same flesh that’s hostile to God. And if you choose marriage, it gives power to that flesh, because you’re living your life in such a way as to compromise with it, and to listen to it, and to walk according to what it wants. And the proof of those desires originating in the flesh is evolution. God put in us the natural desire to fulfil his command, “Be fruitful and multiply.” But when your flesh dies, you won’t be joined with your wife anymore, because it isn’t a spiritual thing. It’s a worldly thing.

An appointment by which two individuals intend to learn about each other to see if they are sufficiently compatible to pursue further and more intimate degrees of relationship status. That sounds like a date to me.

The world doesn’t need me to give it new ideas and new perspectives about timeless questions. Wise men have already done that task. What the world needs to do is take advantage of and tap into the ideas that wise men have already inscribed in human history. Is ideology so different from innovation? Only in it’s timelessness and virtual immunity from modernity.

Excessive use of legalise in contract drafting is not binding because it uses language that the layman will not understand when he “agrees” to the terms. Legalise is understood by a narrow discourse community of those who have studied law, and is intended for the understanding of what should be in a contract, not for painting with colors that people will be blind to. Example: “exculpatory clause” is a mase we would give to a clause which excuses the service entity from damage liabilities, for which it should be expressly written in the contract, not as “Contractor maintains exculpatory privileges from compensatory damages,” (they don’t know what exculpatory means—being excluded from culpability, neither do they know that compensatory damages is a legal remedy which repays the victim) but “If damages are made to Project, Contractor will not be liable for making repayment.”

6 hours for a minute of footage is my Mendoza line (standard of incompetence.) I’m actually not into sports at all, I’m just into academia, and my accounting professor was one of those football / baseball fanatics, so some of its discourse crept its way into my vocabulary.

It’s interesting that the majority of the Bible is written to and for men. There’s a lot of, “Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; I will not think upon a maid;” that doesn’t work if you’re a straight woman. Men have all kinds of verses that equip them for godliness, but there are less verses to keep women from lusting after a sir. I think this is indicative of the amount of testosterone women have that severely decreases their sex drives compared to men, and also because trust is an antecedent for estrogen acting out, there are fewer temptations for women.

Now the reason I want to do eisegesis on John 15 is because it’s been helpful to me in fighting sin. What do I mean by eisegesis? Instead of taking the meaning out of the text, I reading my agenda into the text. You need to know that before you hear this message. It’s a good application, but I don’t know if it’s a good interpretation. So, eisegesis: “He who bears much fruit, my father will prune.” You say, “Well that’s an ambiguous passage, I don’t know what fruit means.” It means bringing forth after your own kind. But what I’m going to argue for, is that when you are wise with your time, and you budget it throughout the day, and you stop being lazy and get to work, God will cut the sin out of your life. Again, it’s a bad interpretation. This isn’t what that passage means. The way I know that is because it says in verse __, “Apart from me, you can do nothing,” and unbelievers can get to work and be wise with their time to. But my experience of this application has been true. Idle hands are the devil’s workshop. Make an excel spreadsheet with a productivity measure. Keep your self trying to be prolific. If you want to cut the sin out of you’re life, watch my series on laziness. I promise you, your life will change, and as you become fruitful in work, God will cut the sin out of your life. A good interpretation of this principle is Genesis 4:7. So the reason I can take John 15 and it’s a good application, and a true principle even though it’s a bad interpretation is because you find the truth elsewhere in the Bible. … Get to work for God populating heaven. You say, “Well I don’t know enough to get anyone saved.” Then use your time to study until you do! The Bible says that much study is a weariness of the flesh. When God looks down from heaven, and he sees you working hard training yourself to get to work, he’s going to bless you, and you’ll see the sin begin to fall off. But if you know enough and you’re still fruitless, and you just keep saying, “I need to study more,” even after already having read the whole Bible, and you just keep demanding more seed, more seed, why should God give you more seed when you haven’t done anything with the seed already in your heart? I not being mean, I’m just being real. If you have received the seed of the whole counsel of God, and it hasn’t sprung up to produce fruit, it’s time to till the soil. It’s time to get to work. Jesus said whoever hears my words and doesn’t act on them I will liken to a foolish man who built his house on the sand. I’m not saying to stop reading the Bible, that’s necessary. I’m saying stop making excuses. Yeah, maybe you don’t know enough to take on Richard Dawkins, so what? Your apologetics and all your preparation and persuasive techniques won’t save anyone. All that will do is save you from embarrassment and enable you to have the last word when people reject the gospel. You know what will save people? Truth. The seed of the gospel being planted in the hearts of the perishing is what will save people, when God draws them to himself. You are say, “I don’t know enough,” spend two hours of your week learning the Romans Road, and boom, now you know enough. Because you have truth in your arsenal. Stop putting it off and waiting until you have something smart to say for the people who have already made up their minds to reject God. Your ministry is not for them, it’s for the one’s whose soil will receive the word, not reject it. What you need to do is be like the apostles when it says they rejoiced to suffer shame for the sake of the gospel. If you preach the gospel, you will suffer shame. You will encounter people who are smarter than you, haters of God (and you know why? Because it takes a really smart person to make a lie look like truth. It takes a really smart person to take the things that have been clearly perceived since the foundation of the world, and suppress them, and put evolution it’s its place. They are the children of the devil. The lie of evolutions started when Lucifer looked up and said, “I will ascend.” He tempted Adam with the same thing: “You can be like God.” And he’s been lying to us ever since, and the people who are smart enough to make something as stupid as evolution sound real can deceive themselves into believing anything.), Christ-rejecters, and what you need to do is walk away rejoicing that you suffered shame for the sake of the gospel. What you need to do strip yourself of Saul’s armor, pick up the little stone of David, and get to work. What you need is to arm yourself with truth and faith in it, and be unashamed of the gospel, and go out in the boldness of faith so that you plant the seed even if you can’t be smarter than someone in the crowd. I spent a long time learning apolagetics, and all its done is hindered me because the fuller my head is with the wisdom of men, the less room for the word of God to speak. And the wisdom of men can’t produce faith in anyone, because faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ. Not the word of men, but the word of Christ. If you’re looking to get people saved, you do not need to step outside of the Bible. Everything extra-biblical is completely useless in turning people to God. I love William Lane Craig, I love apolagetics, but all they do is save Christians from embarresment, they don’t save anyone except by the word of Christ. Maybe you can change somebody’s intellectual ascent from being an atheist to a theist, but you can’t make Jesus the Lord of someone’s life without the words of Christ. And the deciding factor isn’t your persuasion, but their soil. All that matters is truth being heard with their ears, entering into their heart, and after that it all depends on what kind of soil their heart is. That’s a biblical perspective. Scatter seed. Don’t wait. Get to work, and God will cut the sin out of your life. … Everybody uses 1 Peter 3:15 to motivate themselves to do apolagetics, but they are doing it wrong. Because at the begininning of that passage, it says to sanctify Jesus as Lord. That means he is your master, he is your authority. But when we do apalagetics, we come from the angle that, “We can’t use arguments from authority because that’s a logical fallacy. Atheists don’t believe the Bible, so if they are going to believe, we need to come at them from outside of the Bible; we need to persuade them with science, with philosophy, with the cosmological argument, the teleological argument, the ontological argument, the moral argument.” No, that’s not sanctifying Jesus as Lord. That’s tossing him under the bus and saying, “Sorry, but I can’t appeal to authority in my reasoning.” But that “fallacy” is literally the antecedent to salvation. Because if you don’t appeal to the Bible, making God your authority, making Jesus your Lord, than you are not saved. (Lord Argument). Apolagetics can get people to be theists. Good, even the demons believe that God is one. That doesn’t get anyone saved. Believing on the Lord Jesus does. And that happens by his words entering into the soil of the eharts of them that are perishing. Some will grow, some will die. Your apologetics has nothing to do with it. God’s word has everything to do with it.

What you call lack of syntax I call poetic scholarship.

You do not have to be that funny. Just show her you have a not-so-serious side. “So, what’s one thing about you I’d never know just by looking?” Compliments are what women remember.

Look, people want to say, “Hate the sin, love the sinner,” but that hindu philosophy is wacked out and twisted. God doesn’t punish the sin, he punishes the sinner. He’s not angry with the sin, it says in Psalm 5:5, he hates the sinner. It sounds like a nice idea to create this dichotomy where my sin is over here, and the innocent little person who was the vessel for that sin is on the other side. “It’s not like he’s the sin. He’s just the instrument by which sin is carried out. He’s a victim.” (Stop it. Do you know what causes sin? Decisions do.) So we just say, “Separate the sin from the sinner,” but it’s impossible to separate the sin from the sinner. The whole point of the cross is based on that principle. You say, “Oh but the cross separated the sin from the sinner.” No, the cross made you born again, regenerate (from the word genes). He didn’t separate you from your sin on the cross, he gave you new life, and it says in 1 John 3:9 whatever is born of God cannot sin. But let me tell you something, your old man, the man of the flesh, your natural man still sins. It says in Romans that he is hostile towards God. God did not save your flesh, he gave you birth. You say, “You just want to hate everybody. How is anyone going to get saved if you don’t love the people who are unbelievers?” But listen, friendship with the world is enmity with God. And what does John say? “Do not love the world, nor the things in the world. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the boastful pride of life is not from the Father, but is from the world. But we’re all stuck on Gandhi’s philosophy because we’re too busy filling our midns with man’s wisdom instead of God’s word. We’re all “love and acceptance,” and one day we’re going to realize that’s Satan’s kingdom, not God’s. Satan’s kingdom accepts anybody. God’s kingdom, not so much.

This album isn’t for listening purposes; it’s really for learning purposes. Listening is just the medium by which we learn. In other words, the listening is not the end, but the means, because the ear is never filled with hearing.

I’m trying to wrap my head around this. People are trying to say men are having sex with 4 times as many women as the average woman has with men. My question is, who are they having sex with? If you have 10 men, and each of them sleeps with 4 different women, and you have 10 women, and each of them sleep with 1 man, something doesn’t add up. If each of these women only slept with 1 man, and each, then none of the men could have slept with more than 1 women.  For every number you add to the male, there has to be a female reciprocator. – Ha ha. The video goes on to address that problem. Every time a man has sex with a woman, it adds to the general tally of both sides. If you innumerate you’ll be prone to underestimation, and if you approximate you’ll be prone to an overestimation. 80 percent of the men’s data was divisible by 5. Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2vN2QXZGnc). It is extremely insightful. Don’t be put off by the title. “Add the bed, subtract the clothes, divide the legs, then multiply﻿.” “fraction speaks louder than words.” “I'd like to put my obtuse angle in her parabola.﻿” The talk lacked maths, other than some equations briefly thrown on the screen.﻿ Nothing about how the models were arrived at or how mathematics actually makes any surprising predictions about sexual phenomena.﻿

“Bea.. I miss you.” “I want sex. Hurry up.” Somebody told me, “That’s straightforward but strangely sexy.” It’s about being straightforward without being sarcastic. 99% of people want to stay safe when they’re being honest about what they want, so they set up sarcasm to be a cushion for them in case they get rejected. Lose the exclamations and the sarcastic kissy faces, and you elevate your game to a sophisticated and more mature level of pleasure. Everybody is worried about being so witty, finding the right euphemisms, and all that nonsense, because they think being direct about what you want isn’t seductive. Or maybe it’s because they’re just afraid that if the feeling isn’t mutual right then it’ll be awkward, so they safeguard themselves by camouflaging their desires with euphemism and euphemism, joke after joke, winky face after winky face, and sarcasm after sarcasm. No, just be forthright and open about what you want. There is a beauty in the vulnerability that happens when you open yourself to the possibility of being rejected by someone. You don’t need to protect yourself against being denied. Lose the sarcasm. There’s nothing particularly humorous about sex. It’s a different kind of connection; it’s deeper than laughing together.

Restatements of the law are not authoritative, but they are the primary sources of education in schools of law.

Every generalization is going to be within the constraints of certain parameters.

I had this friend in high school that it was natural for us to trade sarcastic insults every interaction. And we were at an event together, and I woke up at 5:30 to run, and as I was passing by, I noticed her in the bathroom doing her makeup, so I poked in and said, “You know… If you would just fix your face, you wouldn’t have to spend so much time trying to hide it.” And she got _pissed_. I was like, “I thought we had an understanding that this was a sardonic relationship?” But there was that moment after I said it that she just paused, and looked over at me, and there was no snarky comeback; I was like, “Crap. She took it personally. Since when does she take my criticism earnestly?” Note to self. Don’t insult her before 8:00 AM. Let her have her coffee and doughnut or whatever it is she eats, and _then_ you can berate her all you want. … I can’t speak for all men, but I appreciate it when women do themselves up. Even if it’s just my cousin or sister or mom. Right? Because it says they care how they look. They aren’t just this lazy couch potato laying around with chaos hair wearing a loose white T-shirt and women-boxers. It honors the people around you when you care about the way that you look, because it means the way they see you is important. It means my opinion about you matters. Right? It’s not just about impressions, it’s about, “Yes, this person generally dresses well and looks good.” Even if they don’t have that in mind when they are doing it, it still honors the people around you. It’s ironic, really. The person who cares the most about how I look is me, not other people. I look the same every single day, even when I am not going to meet anyone of consequence on a given day. If I’m just home alone, no plans to see anyone, I still wake up early to run, shower, and dress. The person who cares the most about how I look is me, and yet the reason I want to look good is not so I can look into the mirror, wink, and say, “You look good.” No, it’s for other people. Even if you aren’t aware of it.

Bitch means dog, and dogs are loyal. That’s what I hear you saying when you’re talking about your bitch. “My girl is loyal.”

What you need to understand is that the most difficult thing for a person to put a cap on is their own psyche. When somebody tells you, “I like men that [fill in the blank],” [“really…” expression] they have no idea what they like. What you like isn’t something you choose, it’s something you analyze. And when people are trying to pin down the characteristics they like in men, it’s all theory. Because it’s an evolutionary science that determines what you like, not your decisions about, “Well he’s an upstanding person. I will decide to like him.” No, it’s the other way around. “I like him. And I like this other person. They share this attribute. I probably like people with this attribute.” But you need control groups to analyze that, and most layman suck and using control groups. So when I tell you what biologist say about the science of attraction, it’s more accurate than what your layman friend tells you about themselves. There’s a saying psychologists use in the context of people deciphering what’s going on with their own psyche: “The first person is the worst person.” I know you think, “You don’t know what’s going on with me!” It’s normally very opposite, my friend. People on the outside looking in can look at you more objectively, rather than everything you think about yourself being subjective interpretations of anecdotal evidence.

I don’t mind that we have enemies. When I was persuaded about disembodied Nephilim cultivating human DNA to create their own vessels, which now are alien grays, it scared the crap out of me. I was shaking, and my only peace came from hope in Jesus. I couldn’t sleep until I made my peace with God. I was shaking, praying fervently, terrified, and then the peace of God hit me because the presence of God ensued me.  Terror of enemies is only subsided by greater terror of God, and peace comes from right standing with him. That’s why terror drives me to the gospel, because I want more than anyting in that moment to be in the presence and safety of God, and I can’t have that peace if there is unconfessed sin on the table. So it drives me to look at Jesus for my justification, confess my sins, and run as fast as I can to the cross. I’m pleading with God in those moments. I saw a video recently of the “deep web,” or the “dark web,” where a guy had hacked his way into a “mokey room” where there was an event going on. To this moment I don’t know what the event was, except that it terrified this guy so that he forsook hacking altogether, and I saw one second of a clip of a demonic figure before I closed it from fear. That image haunts me now, and the only release from that terror is not trying to get away from him, but from confronting him with the boldness and authority of the name of Jesus. I imagined the group of hackers in a physical place with the demon, and I would walk straight in singing hymns, and the reason I could do it is because my Father is right there next to me, and no demon would dare touch one of God’s kids with him standing right there. That terror forces me to be aware of God’s presence. Sometimes when we’re being tempted, say to commit fornication with a girl, you forget God. You try to block him out of mind so that you can act like a child of the devil. But Paul says, “Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid!” Sin comes from losing the awareness that God is with you. It’s the same as it was in the desert, when Israel had witnessed all the miracles, and then when they had a complaint they said, “Is God with us or not?” They didn’t remember God’s presence. They were fearful and they didn’t have peace because they didn’t have their minds stayed on God. I think it is one of the healthiest things in a person’s walk to encounter the enemies of God, to be aware of them, to perceive the fullness of their disturbing, eerie, spooky, disconcerting, ghoulish, ~~frightful~~, gruesome, dire, grim, hideous, strange, terrible, awful, eccentric, ~~horrible~~, appalling dreadfulness, so that you have no choice but to fly to Jesus for comfort, because he’s the only one you feel safe with. Walk around every minute of every day with an awareness of the demonic forces of evil so that you will be in like manner aware that your Father is with you, and you won’t be tempted in those moments. Another good reason to imagine demonic forces is because they are real. They are real. They aren’t made up fabrications of a YouTuber. Peter said the devil prowls around like a roaring lion. They are terrifying, the only reason we aren’t aware of how terrible they are is because the devil knows if he makes himself scary to us, we’ll run straight to God. No, that’s not his strategy. He is a siren. He plays his song to entice you, to make himself invisible to you, to discreetly tempt you to speak evil about someone, to look at pornography, to steal, to lie, so that you think that’s just the way you are and you even go so far to deny Satan even exists. There are two extremities. (1) “My shoe is untied. Satan!” And (2) “Yeah, Satan exists… But come on, it’s not like he’s active in America, or in my family. He’s got bigger fish to fry. We’re so civilized with all of our modernity, Satan hasn’t been active here in a long time. Plus, he isn’t omnipresent, so why should I be worried that he’s going to single me out?” Avoid both of them. Maybe the reason Satan was more horrific to the people of the past is because he showed himself to be more horrific when they didn’t have the mystery of the gospel revealed to them. Their only chance to be at peace with God was to live right like Job. So if you were a wicked person (like most people are), and you didn’t know the gospel, you weren’t going to go run to God no matter how horrible Satan is, because God’s even scarier. … The obvious presence of Satan is the most powerful fuel a Christian can have to make him absolutely on fire for God. But when you feel secure, you don’t really need God, and you end up becoming your own God because you’re trusting in yourself for security, instead of being totally insecure with yourself and totally secure in Jesus. What’s your foundation? What’s your security? Are you trusting yourself for what only God can provide? It comes from ignorance. It comes from closing your eyes and shutting your ears to everything the Bible warns about the devil, every piece of art work the world has made to depict his horribleness, and you just walk on casually into the pits of hell. No! Do not trust yourself to make you secure. You don’t know it, but there are fires all around your house. The reason you think you’re independent, and secure, and idolatrously casual about life is because you don’t see the fire. If you saw it, you would know that you are helpless to save you, and you would need to put God in the forefront and trust him, but because you don’t feel threatened, you only “trust” God with your mouth and you spend your whole day completely secure, not because you are aware that God is with you, but because you’re not aware that Satan isn’t. Your mind isn’t set on God, it’s set on you and your desires, and your desires are worldly. There’s an illusion of security and an illusion of peace in that life, that’s why they call the devil the father of lies. “Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusts in thee.” If your mind isn’t set on God because you don’t trust him, you don’t have peace; you never will. Satan’s mission is to make you independent and autonomous like he is, so that you think you can breathe by yourself, and once you think you can breathe by yourself, your mind gets off of God on onto your job. Your ambitions. Yourself. The whole point of the gospel is to get your mind on Jesus and off of yourself for justification. For sanctification. For glorification. Did you know that glorification happens because we will see him just as he is? It’s such an amazing parallel. Justification and peace comes from looking to Jesus for justification, and glorification comes from seeing him as he is. It’s all about looking to Jesus. Don’t let your eyes wonder for a moment. Be aware of God. Imagine him standing right next to you, watching over your work, your response to temptations, and everything you do. It’s going to change your life.

“The Bible says that the words of Jesus Christ are wholesome words. And the Bible says every word of God is pure. And so don’t accuse me of using bad language. That’s what the Bible says.” ~ [Steven Anderson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo3o4nfiG7A)

When I see a cute little girl on her way to her teenage years, I pray for her. “God I pray that you would be with this girl; keep her from fornication and help her to walk in purity. Amen.” What I understand is that she is going to be particularly tempted, because she will be particularly tempting for the boys. She will receive more pressure than less striking girls.

I just want to debunk this myth that everyone seems to believe right now that men and women have difference brains. It’s a lie. It got popularized in the 19th century before neuroscience based on 5 anecdotal cases studying the behavior of men and women. In other words, they were trying to impose their thesis onto the research instead of deriving their thesis from the research. That wouldn’t pass in a fourth-grade class room today. As soon as we had brain-imaging technology, people started looking for the difference between men and women, and you know what they found? There is no difference. Men tend to have a slightly larger amygdala than women (the region of the brain that is correlated to emotion), which is exactly opposite from the “findings” 200 years ago. Now, when any study uses the words “tend to” and “slightly” in the same sentence, that means there are many outliers, not just a few. So it would be nonsense to look at an image of a brain and try to predict whether it belongs to a male or a female. You can’t impose these kinds of “tending” “slight” differences as a stereotype for people who fit into “male = larger amygdala” category. It’s just as likely that yours is larger than his, because every trend is arrived at through outliers (underperformers and overperformers). Every average is made up of anomalies. Nobody can just assume, “he has a bigger amygdala than me because he’s a male.” There is no such thing as a gender-specific brain. And people like to say that based on MRI scans, women tend to use the left side .. In the first place, you aren’t functioning the way you normally function when you are being scanned by an MRI machine. They put you on your back in a very uncomfortable, cold, metal machine, where you are not doing anything you normally would, you aren’t working, you aren’t with your friends, and they think that’s a good way to measure how our brains work? There’s this variable called “Stimuli” that virtually every scan overlooks. And that’s how our brains react to different situations. Make sure they did their “research” without overlooking those variables, because shockingly, most research overlooks many variables.

There is no much pseudoscience still being published today that’s based on nothing substantially compelling. If you try and find their sources, you won’t, either because they just made it up or you will find them, and when you go into them you’ll find that none of the studies used positive and negative control groups. You can’t do science like that. We have actual brain scanning technology today. When you come across research you pretty have to check the sources today because as a general rule, “If you can prove it on the internet, you can disprove it on the internet.” And when I say, “Check your sources,” I do not mean, “Figure out who said it.” I mean, “Figure out how they arrived at their conclusions, if they used proper scientific methods, if they were honest with what they published,” etc. To many people take “they did a study on it” for granted. Veretasium showed that 70% of studies are either wrong, incompetent, or dishonest. So don’t go for the bait of, “Such and such tends to,” “according to a study done.” That’s nonsense. It’s drivel garbage today, because our problem is not a lack of information, it’s an overload of [misinformation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNOJfIkbGF4).

Brian’s being wise in his own eyes wrecked me from voicing my ideas because he mocked them very confidently every time. He has this way of belittling your ideas as if he knows exactly how everything works. It took me a long time to figure out that Brian doesn’t know as much as he thinks he knows. The way I figured that out is when we’re talking about something I know a lot about. Brian is a jack of all trades. He has 20 different skillsets, but he isn’t great at any one of them. You can know a lot about a few things, or a little about many things, and Brian is the latter. He knows just enough to sound like he knows what he’s talking about. He knows vocabulary and what things are called, but his objections about the mechanics of how they work has proven to be unfounded time and time again. The only thing he knows how to do is a mediocre job. He isn’t an expert in anything because he is a layman in everything, but he likes to sound like he is an authority. I remember when a song came on his Pandora, and I said, “Get that EDM going!” and he looked at me with his eyes rolled and a, “Really?” face, asserting, “This isn’t EDM.” To which I replied, “This is EDM.” He said, “It’s a 90’s genre that,” and I cut him off, “This is EDM, it’s electronic dance music.” “This is _not_ EDM.” “It is using electrophones, Brian. You understand that EDM is a big umbrella term?” Reluctantly he conceded, “Okay I guess. It’s just not what I think of EMD.” Earlier that weekend he exclaimed to Deborah, “Don’t use it like that! You’re going to break it!” When she was clipping tree branches. I wasn’t a good way to use it, mind you, but she wouldn’t have broken the device. Brian is a man who is wise in his own conceits, and there is more hope for a fool than for him. I believe in the economic principle of specialization, because that’s how economies thrive. But not Brian. He just wants to do everything himself, and because of that he doesn’t do anything professionally, and he looks down on those of us who are experts in one field and leaves building a house to construction workers. When I was excited to learn how dry wall was mounted (with nails), and that I hadn’t known that, he remarked, “Really??” as if it’s the most obvious thing in the world. No, it’s not the most obvious thing in the world. Dry wall has been a mystery for me forever, because I’ve never seen it done. I’ve never had to. I would expect to see some nail heads if it was put up with nails. I’m not born automatically knowing about mudding and texturing. Brian may know how it’s done. It doesn’t mean he’s going to do a good job. And you know why? Because he’s got a million other things he’s trying to juggle. But when you live that way and try to do everything yourself, economies fail. I’m not saying that there should be a market for people to come and tie your shoes for you, but things that require training and knowledge, you should pay them to do it and spend that time working on what you’re good at so you have the money to pay him. That’s how specialization works. Instead of both of us making a mediocre shoe and a mediocre jacket, I’ll make two excellent shoes and you make two excellent jackets and we’ll trade. Brian doesn’t understand that basic principle, and he accuses me of not knowing anything, and that is why I’m not animate to work with him. He doesn’t provide training, he just expects me to know what I’m doing, he acts like he knows more than he does, he’s arrogant, he’s wise in his own eyes, and he’s a pain in the neck. The fool can’t even stop looking at pornography, and he calls it “art.” He uses the one thing he specializes in for sin (nude photography), and he doesn’t even believe it’s wrong anymore. I’m partially to blame for that, because I didn’t condemn it on an instinct when I had his ear. I went through a phase where I had to have a compelling answer if I was going to speak with surety, and since I didn’t have any unequivocal verses up my sleeve, I let him know that, and now he’s only more convinced that what he’s doing is okay. I was honest with my thoughts with the verse that he himself knew, that “Whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her in his heart,” adultery meaning to break wedlock. Lusting after a woman is a sin against your wife, because you’re breaking the oneness of wedlock by giving your heart to another. Committing fornication has only one consequence: you take her as a wife and stay faithful, because once you go into her, you’re one with her. The next time you commit fornication, then it’s adultery. But what if you lust after a women having never been joined with a women? You aren’t committing adultery in your heart, because you don’t have a oneness of wedlock to break. You are committing fornication in your heart, but the reason that the only consequence of fornication is staying faithful to her (rather than a punitive consequence it’s an ontological consequence) is because of the biological oneness of the flesh that binds you when you commit it, and that doesn’t happen with lust. So I was honest that I didn’t have any verses on the top of my head that condemned fornication of the heart, but I intuitively knew it was wrong. And I didn’t tell him that because, again, I was under the mindset that I don’t have the right to make baseless claims. It is what I hated about Christianity at that point, people just assuming their own morality and teaching for doctrines the commandments of men, and I didn’t want to do that, so I kept quiet, and now Brian wouldn’t listen to me even if I said something. I still haven’t formed a good argument against it, because I’m too busy dealing with my own issues, and I do not need to be persuaded that fornication of the heart it wrong because I’m already convicted that it is. One of the last lines of respect that Brian has for me is that I’m not condemning. He’s open with me for that reason. If I break that, I need it to be with substantial verses in my pocket.

I really like the divine undertones of the Declaration of Independence, the endowment of “unalienable Rights” by the Creator, but I think the founding fathers were wrong about those rights that were enumerated, “Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.” Nobody has the right to life. Life is a privilege, and the proof that the forefathers didn’t really believe life is an “unalienable right” is that they believed in capital punishment (the Constitution plainly sanctions capital punishment in several instances—most popularly the 5th & 8th amendments). They believed that there were things you can do to lose the privilege of life. If it’s an unalienable right, it can’t be surrendered. But they believed you could be “deprived” of life after “due process of law,” and that’s inconsistent with what they wrote in the Declaration of Independence. They knew it wasn’t an unalienable right. And that’s the way life is treated in the Bible: As a privilege, not a right.

Quick tip: “We’re going to twist it that way and stick the top in the car.” “Than I don’t need to be here.” “Someone has to. We’re going to pick it up.” “Oh. We’re going to turn it. Twisting has two rotations.” Don’t say, “We’re going to twist an object over” if you’re only rotation in one direction.

I have a very deep-seated respect for women who, underneath it all, have no ulterior motives for their commitment to God, and love and joy for and in Christ. I meet so many women who put on a plastic Christianity to get an upright husband, and their “love and joy” for and in Christ is a means to that end. They think church is the best place to find someone. That bothers be immensely. It makes me cringe how prevalent it is. Women who have no problem wearing a cross around their neck, but shirk when it comes to wearing one on their back. So when I meet a women who has zero intention of getting married, and especially if they’re beautiful and humble and have every chance in the world to get paired up, but they keep themselves in purity, I think that is the most uncommon thing I’ve ever run into, and I’ve only seen it in one person. Look, I know a lot of women that get emotional in worship, and “spiritual” in bible study, and I’ve always felt there was something spurious about it, and when I talked to a lot of high schoolers over time who’ve let me unlock their psychology, they discovered I was very right about this surface level spiritualism that’s wrapped up not in trying to impress God, but they were performing before men. Even worship leaders so often perform to elicit a feeling, a spiritual aura in the audience, and their faces get contorted, and they are not worshipping in truth. It’s a show. I’ve helped run the show, and that’s when I started being alienated from the church, when I started looking at the people behind the scene. It’s nothing very different from theatre groups. But there are so many women who just underneath it all, their walk with Christ is a performance to find their “Boaz” who will “respect-that-azz.” Have you seen that meme? It’s so funny. But it’s also very true to what motivates so many women. They’re trying to find their Boaz, and so buried somewhere in their motivations for reading their Bible and speaking up in church (which women shouldn’t do, and they would know that if they were trying to please God and not man), is pleasing people, not God. It’s showing themselves approved (but before men, not God). The thing that motivates their spirituality is impressing a person. They have that mentor, or that boy, and they want to be godly for _them_. And they think it’s okay because it’s just somewhere in the back of their mind, but that’s a suppression of the truth, because when you let it live in your mind at all, it’s really in the forefront. God is really not okay with you loving him to impress somebody else. It’s not organic, and it’s not true devotion. It’s worse than Solomon, who’s biggest sin was that he wasn’t fully devoted to God. Part of his mind was split committing to other things. Or like Martha, who’s problem was, Jesus said, “Listen, you are concerned with many things. Your problem is that you have a lot going on in your mind, and I’m just one of those things. I need to be the only thing.” You getting a husband has to be collateral. Your relationship with God causing a man to notice you, and love you for it, and take you to be his wife has to come without you trying to be noticed by putting the spotlight on your “closeness” with God. You can’t have that anywhere in your motives when you worship God, when you pray. I’m telling you, this is a sin unto you if this is you, and I understand because I used to pursue God to impress my mentor of the year, and I had to come before God and go after that thing, because it messed me up, and what I thought was real, ended up not being real. You have to get to Christ, you have to make him everything. And when I see a woman without ulterior motives, she’s the person who is clothed in scarlet. There’s this Asian girl named Jennifer who fits the bill, and she probably thinks nobody notices her, but I notice her. And I have tremendous respect for her because of that. And I think she wants to get married, but she doesn’t put on this show of spiritualism to subtly announce her godliness and availability. And there’s another girl I know named Amy, and she’s nearly 30 years old, single, and she adorns herself in chaste behavior. She is the reason I can’t say Ecclesiastes 7:28: “I found one upright man among a thousand, but not one upright woman among them all.” And it’s because when I see her, her chastity is organic. There’s nothing underneath it that’s really aiming at something besides God. That’s so incredibly rare. And I wish there were more women like that.

One thing I struggle with is judging between real and fake Christianity. When the angels asked Jesus, “Shall we gather up the tares?” He said, “No, lest you uproot some of the grain too.” God didn’t even authorize the angels to judge who is true and who isn’t, why do we suppose we have such a feat? Because we’ll judge angels one day? We were creator lower than the angels. They can see what we can’t. But I am still so confidant and convicted in my discernment of authentic devotion to God and people who do it spuriously. I’m not talking about soteriology, I’m talking about sanctification. Every time I press someone on this, they confess that I’m right. People don’t always see things in themselves that other people can, but most people can evaluate whether it’s true or not after someone else points it out.

She could probably have my brother in a second. He wants to get married but he’s too dang timid to ask anyone out. “What about her?” “I don’t know.” “What don’t you know? She’s beautiful, she’s godly, she’s available. What do you want in a woman that she doesn’t have?” “Well she’s too good though.” “BUT SHE’S AVAILABLE. I mean, what do you want? You have all these standards just so you can find someone who doesn’t meet them? Just ask a simple question, be light-hearted, show her a not-so-serious side of you, and if she rejects you, find someone else. It’s not hard to move on from somebody you’ve never been in a relationship with. So what if she knows you’re attracted to her? Everybody knows I’m attracted to them. Because I’m attracted to virtually every girl I run into. I even asked her one time, ‘Amy, are you into younger dudes?’ That was not subtle. She laughed it off and I had dinner at home that night. There’s nothing embarrassing about being attracted to someone. Believe me, it’s flattering. She isn’t going to say, ‘Jeez, that guy has bad taste if he’s into me.’ What are you afraid of?” – And you women, who toy with guys’ emotions by being too afraid to just plainly say, “Sorry dude… Not into you.” Don’t play games. You’re not going to hurt his feelings by turning him down. You aren’t that irreplaceable. There’s like 3 and a half billion other women on the planet. You don’t owe him anything. Just be honest and stop wasting time trying to figure out how to sugarcoat your rejection.

Here are my standards: clothed in scarlet, equally yoked, undivorced, and of course unmarried. You can have a promiscuous past. That doesn’t violate any standard of mine. Look, do I believe Christ has cleaned you from all unrighteousness or not? Don’t think, “Well, what he doesn’t know won’t hurt him.” Look, if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all inrighteousness. Unconfessed sin is not cleansed sin. You can be clean with your husband, no secrets, or you can be defiled with what he doesn’t know. I highly recamend plan A. Get it out in the open. Sure, it’ll sting. He can handle it.

Singleness takes more virtue, more will-power, more strength than marriage ever will. Married people can spend their passions on their spouse. Single people have no outlet. They have to beat their bodies to keep under subjection, taking heed lest they fall. People think, “Singleness is easy because you don’t have to stay faithful to anyone.” Wrong. You stay faithful to yourself and you stay faithful to the will of God. The difference isn’t that I can sleep with anyone I want; the difference is I stay celibate. It takes a special kind of person to be able to live that way. Even Jesus said, “Only those to whom this word has been given can receive it.” You are more complete without a spouse, not less complete. You are more committed to the things of God, not less committed. And you are more whole, more sanctified without being bound to the temporal institution of marriage, because you are unburdened by the things of the world and how to please your wife. This is 1 Corinthians 7. This is Bible.

I don’t want to look for a loophole; I want to look for the will of God.

“I know you don’t want to get married, but can I just live with you, and eat with you, and walk with you without being married? I love being around you.” “That’s what the church is, dearie.” And the beauty of it is that it’s not exclusive between one woman and one man, it’s for everyone, the whole body. There’s no reason to look at another member of the church having a deep conversation with somebody you connect very deeply with. I used to be the “one” person my brother confided in and talked about deep things with, and one day I saw him talking with Anna, and I wasn’t jelous, and I happy and proud and excited that he was opening up to more people. “Good! Now she understands more things about Brian, and maybe that will affect her behavior.” The more we know about each other, and the more we all identify with each other, the better community we live in. It’s this oneness that is shared by the whole congregation, and that is the beauty of what you just asked me about. It is a marriage proposal when you join the church.

Pornography and prostitution aggravates me. Look, kissing somebody is an outflow of your love for them, and your enjoyment of them. It’s a consummation of something that came before, but the kiss solicited from a stranger is fake. It’s worthless. It’s like that diamond necklace that’s actually costume jewelry. There’s no reason for it. She doesn’t love you. She doesn’t even know you. She’s kissing a screen! She doesn’t know you exist. That’s not beautiful. That’s distorted and perverted, and it makes me angry that women do it. It’s suitable that women can fake an orgasm and men can’t, because by and large it’s women who are paid to be put in the place of a man’s wife. And it’s all fake. It won’t satisfy the same way, because it’s built on nothing. There’s no intimacy. What good is sex by itself? It’s easy, but it is not gratifying.

“You can’t put that in here.” “Is it hers?” “Yes, but she doesn’t have space.” “Oh. I guess she just can’t do presents on birthdays anymore then, huh?” I mean, how many people have this problem where you have more things than can fit in your space? This is the epitome of the proverb, “If you find honey, take only what you need, lest you vomit.” I always expect the ______ reaction when I clean up other people’s things out of family rooms. I honestly get blindsided when people show appreciation. But when you criticize me for it, I am just going to charge you in kindness, that you can’t impose your disorderliness on the family. I don’t want to teach for doctrines the commandments of men, but Paul does say, after a discourse on spiritual gifts, that all things should be done decently and in order (1 Corinthians 14:40). “Every wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands.” And it’s sin to be foolish. Again, I’m not being mean.

The first time the concept of intercourse crossed my mind I was 10 years old, laying on a couch, and I remember thinking, “What if we were all on the titanic, and had to cram into a little lifeboat, and the men had to stick their penises in the women to make room for more people?” Haha! And then I came to my senses and went, “Whoa! What is wrong with me?” Two years later I found out that’s how babies happen. “I guess it wasn’t that unrighteous if it was God’s idea first!” … They said, “Sleeping together”! I thought he sticks it in and they go to sleep, and something magical happens at 3 o’clock where a baby gets conceived. I must have been 16 before I realized, “Oh, there’s this thing called ejaculation where semen goes into the women.” It’s not actually sleeping together, that’s a false euphemism. I mean, what do you expect? They said _sleeping_ together. And you think, “But I thought you said you had this big terrible thing with pornography your teenage years.” Yeah, pornography is anything that elicits a… basically anything that elicits a boner in a guy. It could be a music video of someone dancing around. The point is, if it causes your body to get ready to use your man-parts, then your lust has been aroused and whatever visual stimulus or stimuli caused it is pornography. And if you don’t like that definition, how bout this one: naked women. That was the first search I made on Google that sent me down this slippery slope. I wasn’t interested in watching people have sex. I don’t want to see a naked dude in collateral damage! Ew! In fact, I think that’s why we have so many people becoming homosexuals today; it’s because they watch two people having sex, and they get aroused by the women, and through conditioning their brain is taught to correlate arousal with whatever else is there, namely, the dude who’s banging her. That’s a disgusting thought but I bet there’s some truth in it. That’s how conditioning works. You have the noise, you add the rat, and little Albert gets conditioned to fear the rat even though there’s nothing natural about it. That’s why homosexuality is called an unnatural sin in Romans 1. There’s nothing evolutionarily competent about it.

I think about this kind of thing a lot. I wish I didn’t. I think it started when I used to babysit my little sister when she was maybe 6 or 7, and we would have these conversations about God and Jesus and things in the Bible, and she was just so easy to edify and instruct and bring up in the way of the Lord that I said, “I want to have a quiver full of children.” Right? Because I had the most persuasive sermons up my sleeve that I would give to my older brother’s Caleb, Brian, my sister Deborah, and they were all set like concrete in their lukewarm way of life, unwilling to listen, even though it would be a piercing message, they’re armor was so thick it wouldn’t penetrate them, because they had been desensitized by convicting messages from hearing them and doing nothing their whole lives. Faith was receptive. She changed her behavior when she heard the things of God, and we did it in grace and in happiness, and she got excited about it, and it was the cutest and most encouraging thing to see. Believe me, I wanted to have children more than anything. I wanted to be a father, and there’s nothing that calls a man into maturity quicker and more effectively than training up children in the way they should go. You are forced to explain things in ways that you’ve never really thought about before; when you have to explain it to a 6 year old, everything seems so much simpler, and you gain a depth of understanding from getting rid of the unnecessary complexities that bog down Christian theologians from grasping the simplicity of what God is saying. I don’t want to spend all my time going down deep, staying down long, and coming up dry. Theologians spend so much time thinking that they don’t spend any time doing. Children are simple. “This is what it says. Let’s do it.” Not, “This is what it says, let’s analyze all the loopholes and find out what it ‘really’ means.” These conversations with faith would seldom come, because I would only speak openly with her when nobody else was around, for fear of being admonished.

I like Milo. He’s a funny guy and a very smart person. People are like, “Do you agree with him about everything?” I don’t think he even agrees with everything he says. He’s a provocateur.

Let me explain to you why you’re actually not attracted to me. You’re just lying or confused or something. Red beard equals pheomelanin, which equals mutated MC1R chromosome, which equals “stay away from that man” on an evolutionary level. A mutated gene is an automatic “reject” signal. So whatever you say or think, you are just frankly wrong. How do I know that? Because my beard is red.

Job said, “The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away.” But who took out his kids? It was Satan.  Thousands of years later, some Pharisees said, “By Beelzebub Jesus casts out demons.” And Jesus said, “Whoever blasphemes the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven. This tells me that it’s better to attribute the work of Satan to God then to attribute the work of God to Satan. Job was never chastised for saying, “The Lord taketh away. God was not angry at Job’s servants for saying, “The fire from heaven fell.” The difference between Job and the Pharisees is that Job saw the work of Satan and said, “It is the work of God,” whereas the Pharisees saw the work of God and said, “It is the work of Satan.” If you had a bad dream, I would be exponentially more comfortable attributing it to God than to Satan. Be careful what credit Satan with.

If you’re a pharisaical loop-hole seeker, then kudos to you. Otherwise I assume you know what I’m talking about when I use common language signals to diffrintiate between my hair and my beard.

I’m curious about Deborah. I feel like if I asked her the $1.10, $1 more question she would take a long time and get it right, indicating an automatic handing off to the working part of her brain. In other words, I don’t think she has a functional automatic spatial reasoning system, such that she always thinks through things the long and effortful way. This would be an interesting development in understanding more appropriate learning techniques for the commensurate diversity of minds.

I don’t believe in this “lifestyle of fornication” concept. You can only commit fornication one time, and after that it’s adultery. Because when you commit fornication the first time you’re bound with that person, you become one flesh, and anything that steps outside of that is breaking that lock.

I’m not asking an epistemological question, I’m asking where your faith is.

Songs and music have the ability to change our hearts, to change us. None of us should take the things we allow ourselves to hear lightly.

I read a long time ago that God grants sleep to those he loves. Years later I notices that when I was joyful I had no problem getting out of bed, but when I lacked joy getting out of bed was less preferable than death to me. Then I connected the dots: when I’m joyful it’s because I’m in right standing with God, and my sorrow always sprang from a sin issue in my life, and so I interpreted that verse in light of my experience with sleep and its relationship to joy. That isn’t innately an invalid hermeneutic. There were times in the Bible that the disciples were like, “What?” And then they had an experience and were like, “Oh.” How about the cross? Was it eisegesis for the disciples to interpret things that Jesus said in light of events that transpassed just because they didn’t understand it that way when they first heard it?

The best birthday present I ever received was when my whole family pitched in and got me a wake-up light. Individually we can to well, but the best reaches of our stretch comes from being a piece of something bigger. This is how the church needs to operate.

So many people think that if you can’t speak Greek fluently you have no business teaching or even interpreting from the Greek New Testament. So what, being fluent in Greek suddenly makes you above dictionaries? “Oh I speak Greek; dictionaries aren’t accurate for me.” I mean, how to we learn words in English? By hearing them in their context, sure, but we get them wrong all the time, and a dictionary is our authority in English, not a word’s usage by fluent speakers. I never knew the word “Fantastic” meant “Imaginative or fanciful; remote from reality.” That’s what the word means. Usages are dynamic, but definitions are stable. We can’t interpret the Greek based on its modern usages. It’s a completely different language in the first place. There is nothing invalid about searching a Greek word in a dictionary to understand what it means if you aren’t fluent. I mean, even if you were fluent in Greek, how would you learn a word you don’t know? You’d look at a dictionary! That’s how English works, and that’s how all developed languages work. It’s nonsense to say I don’t understand that one word because I don’t understand the whole language. If you’re fluent in Greek, and you think the word means something other than what the dictionary says it means, I’m going to trust the dictionary, not you. Sorry.

## Steven Anderson on Homosexuality

I really like Steven Anderson. I have outstanding respect for the pastor; pastors are due double honor, so we should speak well of him. I disagree with him on a number of points, you know, I wish I could sit down with him and talk, maybe he could persuade me, because I’m definitely open to changing my ind in light of the Bible, and that’s what I love so much about pastor Anderson is that he is saturated in the Bible. The things I disagree with him about he would probably consider fundamental; I think they’re secondary. I don’t believe homosexuals (or reprobates, as Anderson synonymates) are beyond forgiveness. Jesus said “All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.” All manner of sin, Pastor Anderson, except blasphemy against the Holy Ghost. So unless you can convince me that homosexuality falls under the category of blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, Jesus said it will be forgiven men. Paul said “Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.” Did you catch that? Abusers of themselves with mankind were washed, were sanctified, and were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus. It seems to me that Jesus wants homosexuals to be saved. I do understand were Anderson is coming from, and I am definitely open to changing my mind if he can convince me from the Bible that homosexuals will not be saved. But I think it’s a wild leap in Jeremiah 6:30 to say that the word “reprobate” is synonymous with “rejected,” (Update: it’s the same word in Hebrew) and even if that were the case, I think it’s another leap to say “rejected” is equal to “un-savable.” Psalm 89:38: “But thou hast cast off and abhorred (h3988), thou hast been wroth with thine anointed.” Now he’s talking about David here, and to be cast off and abhorred means to be rejected. And the proof of that is that it’s the same word used in Jeremiah 6:30 where God says, “Reprobate silver shall men call them, because the Lord hath rejected (h3988) them.” Not everyone who is rejected is going to be saved, obviously; but also not everyone who is rejected won’t be saved. David was saved, and yet Ethan writes about him, inspired by God in Psalm 89, “Thou hast cast off and abhorred thine anointed.” So I don’t think rejected means un-savable. Let’s put it this way: I believe in once saved always saved, but I don’t believe in once rejected always rejected. Because David was rejected. If Anderson can convince me of that, than I’d probably agree with him about homosexuals. But I jumping now to Romans 1, where it says, “For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections,” I think using that passage to say that is the only way somebody becomes homosexual… I just don’t see that in the passage. “Gave” is past tense, which means he was talking about something specifically. And them is a restrictive pronoun Who is “them?” People who worshipped idols in verse 23. People who didn’t glorify God as God in verse 21. It sounds to me like he’s talking about a story, not a rule. Like, “This is what happened,” not, “This is what always happens.” I will concede that you can look at any given homosexual and say, “God has rejected him,” because it does seem like the passage indicates that unnatural sin only happens when you’ve crossed a certain line of hatred towards God that he gives you up to a reprobate mind. I’m wishy washy on this point. But what confuses me greatly is in Chapter 2 verse 1 where Paul says, “Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.” Wait, who is he talking to again? Them that are called of Jesus Christ (Chapter 1 verse 6), “To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints,” (chapter 1 verse 7) So within them that are called to be saints and beloved of God, whoever judges another condemns himself because he does the same things as all the sins enumerated in chapter 1 verses 27-32? I’m not following, Paul. The saints do all of those things? I’ll be honest, that verse confuses me. Which is another reason why I’m open to being edified. I don’t’ understand it. Because the way I understand it is that the saints are doing those sins, but that doesn’t seem right because he says in chapter 1 verse 8 that their faith is spoken of throughout the whole world, indicating some level of sanctification. Chapter 2 beginning with “therefore,” meaning on account of the things which were just said, namely, the story of them that were given over to a reprobate mind (verse 28).

So I have two points of contention, and one additional outlook: (1) I’m not sure that everyone who commits unnatural sin has gone through the same process as the people Paul is referencing, and (2) I don’t think “once rejected always rejected” is in the Bible. (3) I’m not entirely convinced that this rejection isn’t an earthly rejection, not an eternal rejection.

Every time he uses it, it’s connected with some physical destruction, or some earthly outcome. God rejected Saul. I’ve heard you yourself, pastor, say that Saul was saved. But if God rejected him? He rejected him from being king.

I want to be fully persuaded before I cast homosexuals behind me, because (2) their eternity is at stake, and (2) I want to go against the will of God if he wants them to be saved. I don’t want to disregard them lest God actually wants them to turn and be saved. Maybe God wants to save them and then destroy their flesh, because sin is in the flesh, like in 1 Corinthians 5:5. “To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.” I’m not saying I’m ultimately closed minded to what you’re teaching, I’m just saying I want to be extremely careful and fully persuaded, because the stakes are infinitely high, and the will of God is infinitely important to get right. And I’m not persuaded. There are testimonies of people turning from homosexuality. There are people that God has evidently brought back from the reprobate mind he gave them up to ([this woman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMULwgd_huU&t=893s&index=608&list=LLBkWJNMdlBmY0zh6VArtv4Q), “reverend” Winfield). I don’t think this woman has all of her doctrine right, but I believe her when she is speaking openly against homosexuality in spite of her testimony. And she’s not the only one. There are thousands of testimonies. With Anderson’s doctrine, you can’t believe them. Any of them. Listen, love believes all things. And I’ve heard Anderson address these testimonies this way: “They’re lying.” Because that’s what you have to say if you believe in “once rejected always rejected.” Call me naive, but I hear these testimonies, and I believe them. She said some questionable things, but I believe her when she says she was grieved to hear about the gay parade in New York City. I believe she meant it when she is warning homosexuals that their path is a path of destruction that leads right to hell. I believe she said it with conviction when she read from Romans 1 in the KJV. A former lesbian, Anderson. Just take you bias off for one minute and watch her hatred for the sins of homosexuality that she was formerly imbued with. I believe God can save homosexuals. If it clearly contradicted the Bible, I would cast all testimonies behind me. But it’s not clear to me that it contradicts the Bible. What’s clear to me is this: whosoever believeth on the Son shall have eternal life. That’s clear. But I don’t see it in the Bible that God’s atonement is limited. Sounds Calvinistic if you ask me. “He died for everyone except reprobates.” The way you go to hell is by rejecting God finally, by tasting the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come, and falling away, that they find no place for repentance, though they seek after it with tears. God rejects you when you reject him. Ironically, this just shifted the balance slightly more towards Anderson’s doctrine, because now I remember that “it is impossible for those who were once enlightened” to find a place of repentance, like Esau, because they crucify him afresh, trampling underfoot the Son of God, having known the way of righteousness, falling away from grace. That gets your foot in the door to transpose that rejection over to homosexuals, but we aren’t there yet, because the prerequisite for it becoming impossible to find a place of repentance (believing on the Lord) comes after you’ve been made partakers of the Holy Ghost. After you have been enlightened, and then rejected God. But then again, what is enlightenment if not that which has been clearly perceived since the creation of the world? I’m so doubleminded on this subject. My argument was formerly that God’s final rejection of you only happens after you die having rejected God, but while you’re saved, there’s still hope. Now I see that some people have fallen over the edge, becoming Esau’s with no place of repentance. This is so complicated! I just want to know the answer. Yet having no answer I will remain hopeful for the salvation of these reprobates, lest any of them had an opportunity and missed it because I was wrong.

It says that God is patient, not wishing any to perish, but to turn and be saved. Any? Who is included in any? All people and excluding no one.

Natural sin or unnatural sin, I don’t think you can make the case that they were worse sinners than Paul, because Paul said he was the chief, “Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.”

John Piper said this, referencing 1 Timothy 1:15: “‘The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom I am the foremost. But I received mercy for this reason, that in me as the foremost, Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience as an example to those who were to believe in him for eternal life. So here is what he is saying. I was a blasphemer, a murderer. He says this in Acts 9: a murderer, a persecutor, a hater. Now let this sink in. Paul was a Pharisee. He believed in demons. There is no reason to believe that Paul disagreed with the Pharisees in the gospels who said Jesus was casting out demons by the power of demons. Paul was a blasphemer. He had walked right up to the edge, evidently, of blaspheming the Holy Spirit. And God chose him, saved him. Why? Paul says it is so that in the 21st century John Piper on a podcast could say to Kayla: Christ is that patient with you. That is why he saved Paul. He saved Paul for Kayla. I really believe Kayla should read 1 Timothy 1:15-16 that way. He, Paul wants to be read as giving encouragement to those who feel like the patience of God has run out. So in the name of Jesus and with the authority of Paul, Kayla, I think I can say to you, I do say to you: Turn and come to Jesus and you will find his arms outstretched to a prodigal daughter.”

“The only way to have unnatural sin is if God give you up to it.” But listen, God can’t tempt anyone. So where is it coming from? I’ll grant you that God giving them up to vile affection is equivalent to rejected them, but Paul did the same thing to Hymenaeus and Alexander, delivering them unto Satan in hopes that they would be saved (1 Timothy 1:20, 1 Corinthians 5:5).

And you know, I’m not opposed to Steven Anderson, I think it would be really cool if he saw this video and did a response correcting me if I am wrong, and I would change my mind. But I haven’t heard him address these arguments yet. And bear in mind I haven’t watched all of his sermons, but I will say this: the more I listen to him the more I go, “He is the real deal.” So if I could have a chat with him, I’m not opposed… it wouldn’t surprise me if he changes my mind. I’m open to the Bible always. It doesn’t profit me to be stiff-necked in my interpretations if their wrong. But this is what I see in the Bible, and I have to stay faithful to that, not to what Steven Anderson says. And Anderson knows that. I’ve heard him do a sermon saying if he ever says something that contradicts the Bible, they need to believe the Bible and not him. But I do see where he’s coming from, and if I had a personal session to ask a few questions, maybe I could very likely change my mind, but right now this is the way I see it.

Another thing I disagree with him about is regarding “Hard Preaching.” The Bible says to adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things. I think his “raw preaching” (as he puts it) violates that. God didn’t say preach it raw; he said “adorn.” He didn’t say, “Get angry at hypothetical sin while you preach.” There is a place for righteous anger, and it’s not in the pulpit. Maybe it is. It definitely is helpful. But that’s something I need to study out.

I also think he’s wrong about 1 Corinthians 11, woman’s hair being a natural covering.

I also disagree about KJV onlism, but I becoming more of an advocate for the KJV the more I read it.

Lamentations 5:20-22: “Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, and forsake us so long time? Turn thou us unto thee, O Lord, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old. But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wroth against us.”

Psalm 88:14: “LORD, why castest thou off my soul? why hidest thou thy face from me?” Casting thou off my soul means to reject. I don’t speak Hebrew, and I know Anderson doesn’t like people going back to the original language (which is another point I disagree on, but we’ll get to that later), but the proof that “casteth thou off” means “rejected” is that it’s the same word used in Psalm 88:14 (h2186) that is used in Jeremiah 6:29 (h3988). That argument fell apart when I did the research. One means, “Cast away, remove far away,” while the other means, “contemn, despise, disdain,”

I looked up all the times God says, “I have rejected (h3988).” Leviticus 26:44: And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away (h3988), neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the Lord their God.

1 Samuel 16:1: And the Lord said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected (h3988) him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.

1 Samuel 16:7: “But the Lord said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused (h3988) him: for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.”

2 Kings 17:20: “And the Lord rejected (h3988) all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight.”

[2 Kings 23:27](http://biblehub.com/text/2_kings/23-27.htm "Biblos Lexicon"): And the Lord said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and will cast off (h3988)  this city Jerusalem which I have chosen, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there.

[Job 8:20](http://biblehub.com/text/job/8-20.htm "Biblos Lexicon"): “Behold, God will not cast away (h3988) a perfect man, neither will he help the evil doers:” (Noting that these words darken counsel—Job’s friends said them, not God).

[Job 10:3](http://biblehub.com/text/job/10-3.htm "Biblos Lexicon"): “Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise (h3988) the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?”

Psalm 15:4: “In whose eyes a vile person (h3988) is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear the Lord. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not.”

[Psalm 36:4](http://biblehub.com/text/psalms/36-4.htm "Biblos Lexicon")

[Psalm 53:5](http://biblehub.com/text/psalms/53-5.htm "Biblos Lexicon"): “There were they in great fear, where no fear was: for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee: thou hast put them to shame, because God hath despised (h3988) them.”

[Psalm 78:59](http://biblehub.com/text/psalms/78-59.htm "Biblos Lexicon")

Psalm 89:38: “But thou hast cast off and abhorred (h3988), thou hast been wroth with thine anointed.

It seems to me that this word rejected is used in a temporal, earthly way. If you are born again, and you’re corrupted flesh still is homosexual, God will reject you on the earth. But not your regenerate new man, because he can’t sin; your degenerate old man.

Personally I hate homosexuals. I used to sympathize with them, but the closer you get to their world, the more disgusting you realize they are.

## Love Speaks Against Sin

Listen, I love you. I’m not saying this as your enemy, I’m saying it as somebody who genuinely cares about your soul. Go ahead and unfriend me, go ahead and shut me down, but believe me, I’m coming to you with some force because I love you. If I didn’t love you, I wouldn’t put my own self out on glass. If I didn’t love you, there’s no way I would risk alienating you, and receiving pushback, and being belittled and slandered for offending you. And there is always risk of that when somebody opens their mouth in edification.

“In legal terms, somebody with an eggshell skull is somebody who has a preexisting condition that makes them more susceptible to criticism. You can’t sacrifice truth because some people are actually going to suffer because of the truth.” ~ Ben Shapiro

“Does the vegan magically confer personhood?” “No, the first breath does.” “Okay, so if the baby is in the womb and is exactly the same size, and has not yet breathed, and you take a knife, and you stab the baby in the head, a fully formed 9 month old baby, it is not a human, the only thing that makes it a human is when it takes a breath. It has to independently breath?”

Everybody is saying dolphins have more advanced communication abilities than humans. Really? They can communicate images with echolocation, and you’re going to call that more advanced than humans? How useful would it be if all we could say was, “Tree. Grass. Water.” That’d be a step back, not a step forward. We can already communicate images with our cell phones in real time. How are you going to say whales and dolphins one-up us in communication? But these so-called scientists want to keep saying, “science tells us that animals can have cognitive faculties that are superior to human beings.” You know what? The snake of Eden was more crafty than any other beast, but the snake lost that ability when he lost the ability to use words as instruments of thought. The only way animals can use words as instruments of thought or communication is through classical conditioning (add the picture to the sound, like Rosetta Stone), but that is not the same way children learn languages. Otherwise apes would have been able to learn significantly larger vocabularies than they do in fact learn through classical conditioning by sign language. Sure, let’s marvel at how we can use psychology to train animals to communicate, but let’s not make it a surrogate, much less superior to the most precious gift humans have. Even the more credible “scientists” that point to the brains of other animals to compare them to humans are making the assumption that brains are directly correlation to intelligence, and that _is_ an assumption. Our brains are identical to our subconscious, which is correlated to our conscious thought, but it is not the substance thereof. You say, “Why do our prefrontal lobes light up when we think if the thinking doesn’t originate in the prefrontal lobes?” It could be a number of things. Maybe they are signal intermediaries that connect our thoughts with signals in the brain, so that when our conscious thought gives the body a command, it does what we want it to. (If the intermediary gets damaged, the signals don’t pass through.) The prefrontal cortex lights up because it is receiving (not producing) signals from metaphysical locale. That’s not that far fetched. In my opinion, it’s nonsense to say signals in the brain are the sole parents of intelligence. If that were true, and whales were smarter than us, you’d think they would have accomplished something more extrodenary than humans by now. You say, “Well they don’t have thumbs.” So what? We don’t have gills. Hasn’t stopped us from breathing under water “That’s different.” Maybe, but it’s pretty far fetched to look at an animal swimming around in the ocean, all they do is swim and eat, and say, “They are more intelligent than us because they have big brains.” How about they have more complex instincts? Larger natural behavior, restrivted to reaction and absent of pro-actions. “Most people believe that a human’s ability to communicate is far more complex and evolved than that of other animals, but cetaceans may have us beat.” Oh of course, because communicating a picture is so advanced. You say, “Maybe they can communicate more than sonar-like images.” Maybe, but you know what I can guarantee you they’re not talking about? They aren’t talking about politics because they don’t have organized government. They aren’t talking about tools because they don’t have hands. I doubt they are talking about philosophy, because thos questions arise from experiences and ideas and stories which come from adventures which require hands and civilization. They’re not talking about abortion. They’re not talking about anything “evolved.” You know what they’re probably talking about? “Food. Danger. Procreate. Sleep. Happy. Angry.” Emotions. I’m with Waseem Ullah, who says, “Dear Sir, Yes I still Believe (not think) that human is the smartest of all. its not just about transmission of 20times more information than human. the real difference comes between intelligence of human as compared to animals is how they are utilizing those 20times more information? do they even think that their exist other species? outside world? human? well, you can say their capabilities are high but not their intelligence. they are like dumb, they have resources but not a way to use them.” “Dolphins are great and all, but who\'s at the top of the food chain again? That would be humans. Sorry dolphins, but until you\'re able to fly to the Moon, your "intelligence" means nothing.” “We like to guilt trip our selves by how many species have gone extinct under our reign, but the planet itself and forces of physics alone have killed more species, on a level man will never conceive from his inception to his inevitable extinction. Sad but true.” “Your sensationalist title doesn’t really have much proof behind it. In other measures of intelligence- such as the Encephalization quotient- some dolphins come close but don’t quite match the score of a human. I know it’s more interesting to frame it as you did but it doesn’t make it true.” “may be able to utilize modes of communication we only dimly perceive.”

Nobody gets saved when the seed of the gospel is covered in sulfur.

There was a time that I was very confrontational, during my college days, and it was rare that somebody would have the guts to disagree with me, but when somebody did manage to muster up the boldness of telling me I was wrong, I made them look so publicly stupid that I can’t think of any other word to describe what I was accomplishing besides alienation. Bystanders cheered me on, but what kind of testament am I making myself as a proponent the gospel? Jesus said to a man that he healed, “Don’t tell anyone what’s happened, but go and show yourself to the preists as you make an offering as a testament to me.” It’s “study to show yourself approved,” not study to preach yourself approved. To argue yourself approved. I was a reverse evangelist. All about rhetoric, and argumentation, and getting the upper hand, and winning arguments instead of winning souls. And once it’s an argument, nobody changes their mind. And all the people who are clapping for me get a sense of who Christians are, and that’s ruthless and without compassion. Because that’s the way I treated any arguments that confronted my own. I always had the upper hand, I was quick and witty, and most dangerous of all, I loved the attention and the standing of being thought wise. My own professors would concede to my points if I confronted them. My heart does not have the capacity to walk back into that and not get pulled in.

I get legitimately upset at my older sister hushing up and censoring common conversations because of irrational fears. Anna will say, “Go where no man has gone before,” and Deborah covers her ear and whines, “Ehhh!” I turned to her and said, “Deborah, you need to stop being afraid of these things! There’s nothing scary about them.” Immediately I regret having allowed my annoyance to manifest itself so harshly, but in retrospect it makes me wonder about something I’ve insinuated. “Stop being afraid.” Is fear something that we choose? Or is it something hardwired and so deeply conditioned in our psychology that we can do nothing about it? I think the answer is right before us. People do face their fears, and people do choose to conquer them, while others, like my sister, only feeds it by suppressing the things she is scared of. It is interesting that she has so many nightmares while I on the other hand have pleasant dreams. I do not guard my eye from seeing any horrible thing, or shield my ears from any talk of horror, or any cry of terror. I see things so terrible she would writhe in fear, and yet I dream sweetly, and she frequently has nightmares. Why? I submit that it’s because she doesn’t face them. She shirks from her fears, gets them as far away as possible, and suppresses it instead of exposing it like the Bible says, but there’s one place that you can’t suppress your fears and run away from it, and that’s in your sleep. And because she has so guarded herself from hearing any terrible thing, it cultivates itself in her mind. They are like cockroaches infesting a home in her head, but she dare not shed light upon them, lest they become visible and she scream, so she keeps them in darkness where they thrive. But they are there, Deborah. Whether you make it visible or keep your eyes closed and your ears shut, they are there. And there is a battle around all of us, but we choose to close our eyes and shut our ears and be ignorant about the fight for our souls. What would happen if you opened your eyes? What would happen if you let yourself see the terrible things all around us? Maybe you would cling to a heavenly Father who is more terrible than any foe, more good than any saint, and more powerful than any force. Maybe it would force you to walk with him every hour every day. Maybe you would find your refuge in the one thing that can make you safe. But the devil knows that, and that’s not what he wants, so he chooses to be invisible to us in America, and we’re so dazed we don’t even know it. We don’t know how horrible the fallen angel is because he masquerades as an angel of light, but beneath the sheep’s clothing is a ravenous wolf. We don’t know the power of the Lion of Judah, because we don’t need him to feel safe. We think we’re secure and safe as we are, and we go to sleep completely oblivious to who God is and everything he is doing. And the most effective way the devil has to keep us from God is to make himself invisible so we never feel the need to run to him. We think God is just this cute little buddy we carry around on a keychain as it were, and we can just “shoot” little prayers up throughout the day, but the Bible says no, he’s a terrifying Lion, and you need to be careful as you enter into his presence, and don’t walk in with haste, and keep your words very few as you speak to him. That’s not the God any of us are familiar with. And won’t we be surprised on that final day when we see God and say, “I never knew you.” And I think many will say that, because the first and second commandment in the Bible are the most commonly broken: don’t make a God to suit yourself. But that’s what everyone does in America. “Oh God is so loving and kind, and he’s my little teddy bear.” That’s foolishness! And part of that comes from not knowing the terror of our enemy, so we never search for the greater terror, the safe terror of our God. The Bible says men loved the darkness rather than the light. Why? What’s so bad about darkness? I mean, there are some scary things in the world that I don’t want to see. But don’t we realize it’s safer in the light than in the darkness? Don’t we realize these monsters thrive on being invisible? But we don’t want to deal with the moment of fear that happens when we acknowledge they are hear, so we’ll just put everything that’s scary to us away in a corner and never talk about it and pretend it doesn’t exist. Well it does exist, and we’re fools to think, “Well all the spiritual warfare is in third-world countries, not in America. Nothing bad ever happens here.” We’re being deceived be the father of lies. He’s here, and my guess is that he is more prevalent in America than anywhere else in the world. The worst thing he can do is show himself here, because if he did we would all fling to God. All that being said, the basis of my annoyance at my sister is not for shoving aside real terrors, but fictional ones. “It will give me a nightmare.” Really? And you can predict that? My question is, is being fearful something you have no control over? Because you are born with only two fears: the fear of falling and the fear of loud noises. Every other fear is conditioned. No baby is afraid of monsters on the TV. We’re taught to fear it. Do our fears belong exclusively in the realm of circumstance and nature, or do we have some say in it? Can we decide, “I’m not going to be afraid of you?” Maybe not that simply, but we can certainly take steps to place our fear where it belongs. People fear what they don’t understand. When you see something that’s not real, you ought to fear it less when you learn that it isn’t real. When you can explain something, it become less terrifying. It’s like those mysterious shadows you see, and then you learn they are cast from a cute little mouse. The more you know about things that are not intrinsically scary, the less you will be afraid of them. But fear is not a bad thing in and of itself. Fear is what prompts us to protect ourselves. Fear is useful. And so our question shouldn’t be, “How can we stop fearing everything?” but “how can we assign fear to things that really are scary?” You see, the more you know about mundane things, the less scary they are. But the more you know about things that are intrinsically scary, things that are both powerful and evil, the scarier they are, and that fear is good. It’s good to be aware of the cobra hiding in the bushes. It’s good to be afraid of that confrontation, because that fear will stop you from entering that situation. It will keep you from being killed. Fear is good, when it is assigned to things that are dangerous. The more you know about things that are terrible, the more terrifying they are to you. So light is always good. Exposing things and learning about them is always good. It’s good both for conquering irrational fears and for creating appropriate fears. It’s good for learning not to be afraid of the cute little harmless mouse, and _for being_ afraid of the cobra. But the antithesis of assigning fear to where it belongs is censorship and hushing people up from talking about things you’re afraid of because “it will give you nightmares.” No, maybe the reason you have nightmares is because you keep all of that hidden away and suppressed; but there is one place you can never suppress them, and that’s in your sleep. Light is never your foe, and darkness is never your ally. Don’t choose darkness; choose light. Let people talk, even listen attentively. The way you beat fear isn’t by making it as small as possible, but by overdosing so that it drives you to your Father, and when you realize the gospel, and you become aware of your Father’s presence, then there is nothing to be afraid of. Picture God standing right next to you as you walk into a room of demons. What are they going to do with your Father standing right there? They shudder at his mention. They are terrified of his presence. And when you become aware that he is with you, Emmanuel, God with us, there is nothing to fear anymore. You can walk towards the cobra if you’re walking with a lion. “Thou wilt shew me the paths of light; in thy presence is fullness of joy, at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.” Isn’t it interesting that he correlates paths of light with God’s presence? Because when we see things as they are, there’s nothing we want more than to be in God’s presence. And when we’re finally driven there, and we realize we can have it, and we walk in it, we obtain the fullest measure of joy, and that comes from being in his presence. And it starts with fear. Why do you think the Bible says the beginning of wisdom is the fear of the Lord? Why not love for the Lord? Why not good feelings towards God? Why fear? The way you interact with God depends on how you see him. And when he's a fun-loving cute little teddy bear you take everywhere with you, you don’t experience the fullness of joy, because you don’t see his power. You aren’t safely afraid. You can’t be in awe of him that way. God is so tremendously powerful, and when you miss out on knowing that power, when you don’t stand behind the firm glass watching it keep back the incredible storm, … God wants us to know him for who he is. He doesn’t want us to water down who he is. And when we do not experience that fear, we can’t experience the fullness of his presence, and we’ll never know the fullness of joy.

One of the things I thought of was regarding the overpopulation of certain species in the absence of preditors, where disease would run rampid and drive them to extinction. I thought, “Shouldn’t natural selection and evolution make some sort of provisions for overpopulation for the preservation of our species as a whole?” Maybe that’s why homosexuality is becoming more prevalent today, so that we don’t overpopulate and kill ourselves. I do not believe this myself, but it may be worth thinking about at some later date.

Justice is sometimes punative, and sometimes corrective. If we’re thinkinh about rapists in terms of punishment, than we might ask “How much harm does it do to the victim?” and then try to find a punishment of equal affect. I do not think that’s the way we should approach it. I’m not interested in punishing the rapist. I’m interested in correcting society. I believe every rapist should be castrated or killed. Other justice becomes punative rather than corrective, and that doesn’t actually do anything helpful for society. Justice becomes an incomprehensible enigma, because punitive justice belongs to God, and if we think we’re smart enough to discern when his punishment should be given and when his discipline should be given we’re fooling ourselves.

“That your sins may be forgiven.” Why not, “That you may be forgiven?” He uses your sins interchangeably with you. There is no divide between sin and sinner.

Um, ma’am, I’m sure you’re familiar with the statute of frauds. I’m curious why you’re not rulling consistently with its provisions. (No judgement is worth more than the law of our land; violating is grounds to have a judge disbarred).

I used to hate it when people said, “The Bible says,” because, like, the Bible usually doesn’t say it, or it’s so paraphrased and twisted that completely puts the verse on its head. “Love the sinner, hate the sin.” “This too shall pass.” And then I heard Steven Anderson. Look, even if you aren’t familiar with the whole Bible yet, you can usually tell when something is quoted from it or not. There’s a certain language, a certain syntax that’s just unmatched by human development. People can’t just make things up and it sound like it’s from the Bible, by and large.

Why does the brain light up when you think or perform mental labor? I submit that it is because the extreme correlation between the brain and the mind. If you hear a sound, say somebody talking to you, the brain first has to receive signals from the ears before it can be consciously analyzed by the mind. The physical and the spiritual are closely linked together, but they are not the same. They interact with each other, but they are not identical to each other. I submit the brain and the mind have interplay, but they are not the same.

It’s amazing how insecurity and pride go hand and hand. You’d expect them to be opposites, but they’re dance partners. And let me explain why: your security is either going to be in God, other people, or yourself. If you’re insecure, your security’s not in God because he’s secure. If your security is in other people then it’s either a dependence thing or a validation thing; if it’s a dependence thing, that’s actually prideful because you’re expecting someone else to do for you what only God can do for you, and it’s arrogant to think you’re entitled to that. If it’s a validation thing, that’s prideful too because you’re really concerned about how people see you (key word _you_). If your security is in yourself than you’re trusting you to do what only God can do, and that’s the most prideful attitude you can have. You are essentially saying to God, “Get out of my seat.” You’re not recognizing that it’s God who is supplying your every breath. You can’t even do that without him. And so if your security is in you, you should be radically insecure. But it all comes from pride.

When I’m responding to teaching before an audience of One, it changes the whole dynamic of my voice, tone words, rhetoric, everything. Often times I’ll try to say things in a funny way, and funny is usually rude. Or other times I’ll say things in a way to get someone to say, “Thank you!” Like, “Finally someone is making sense against this stupid doctrine that they’ve been teaching.” But when you are presently aware of the presence of God, that all changes. You’re no longer concerned with funny because it makes light of something that shouldn’t be made light of. You’re no longer concerned with someone saying, “Thank you!” Because you’re concerned with God saying, “Well done.” Your motivation will change everything in how you interact with people and how you use your words. In what manner are your talking? Loud, quick, witty, and inconsiderately, or soft, gentle, giving grace to them that hear? Don’t speak to hear, “Thank you!” Speak to hear, “Well done.” Your motivations have to be pure.

It’s like sour milk. You make fried oats, you cut up a banana, maybe add a little strawberry and blueberry, and then instinctively you reach in the refrigerator to pull out some milk, only this time it has “Sour?” written on it, but you don’t notice it has “sour” written on it, so you pour it in. It ruins the whole thing. I tried to filter it out, couldn’t do it, the oats absorbed it all in seconds, and I had to dump out my whole breakfast because of one bad ingredient. That’s the way the Christian life is. A little bit of leaven leavens the whole lump of dough.

“I have a point of disagreement with you.” “I’m going to surprise you.”

“And the word sorry used there is the Hebrew word for, get this, sorry.”

I don’t drink. Look, Paul, I alienated you once upon a time over something that was silly, and I’m not going to do it again. I’m not your judge. You have a judge. I really mean that. I don’t have stored up thoughts about, “Well he’s just this horrible sinner who’s trying to justify drinking.” I don’t think you are. Let every man be convinced in his heart. I don’t think you’re violating your conscience. I don’t think you have an agenda to just justify sin. You don’t love drinking that much. It’s just a drink to you. Look, the watchman is guilty of the other person’s sin if he stays silent. I will openly admit that I have a point of disagreement with you. I see principles in the Bible of, “Flee fornication.” Not, “Get as close as you can without crossing the line.” I don’t believe in social drinking. I think we should avoid the gateway sins. It was no foolish saying in China, “First the man takes the drink, then the drink takes the drink, then the drink takes the man.” I’ve seen it happen, I don’t see it happening with you. Look, the Bible says every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. You’re temperate Paul. I have no judgement against you because this isn’t a doctrine I’m fully persuaded about. I really don’t. But I want you to understand that my opinion is not dictated by the way I was raised. I was never taught anything about drinking in my house. My opinion about it comes from the way I read the Bible. I’m a little bit offended that you think I’m so vulnerable to indoctrination that something as insubstantial as my upbringing could be the grounds of my opinion on this. Upbringing is powerfully influential, but nothing I believe depends on what my people told me growing up. That’s just not the case. So I will not drink. I do think you’re wrong to think that it’s okay in moderation. But I don’t think you are wrong in your morality and in your conscience, I think you’re wrong in your Bible study. The reason I make this distinction is because in intellectual fault is far less personal then a moral fault. And I want to also recognize that your intellectual opnion about this topic is not without reasons. There are reasons, so I don’t look at you and say, “Wow you’re stupid for believing this.” It’s just something we disagree about, I think you’re wrong intellectually here, but I do see both sides of the argument, and I have no condemnation to give you. Condemnation is God’s and he said there’s no condemnation. So don’t, please, don’t when you come near me feel like I’m silently judging you, and storing up negative thoughts about you and your drinking. I’m not. I’m at peace with you. Just don’t expect me to agree every time we bring up drinking and you say, “It’s okay in moderation. Love the drink, hate the drunkenness.” I disagree, but I won’t contend because unless you know where I’m coming from you will take it as a personal condemnation of your morality rather than an intellectual disagreement with the way you interpret a nebulous topic the Bible.

Look, I’m not trying to convince you, but I just want to make it clear that I have reasons behind what I believe. It’s not my upbringing, and you need to know that there’s something substantial that’s keeping me from consenting with your arguments. So, Proverbs says, “Don’t look upon the wine when it is red.”

Periodically throughout the day I will recognize a subtle pride in the excitement of something I’ve said, and pause, and pray, “Keep me from pride, Lord. Jesus. Jesus. Humble my heart. Wisdom is from you. Amen.” I need to remember to do that.

I’m an advocate of proficiency because that learning translates into real world product, and I’m also an advocate of growth because that’s how we will maximally use the capabilities of individual persons in society. The only standard of proficiency God uses is Jesus, and nobody matches that; that’s why sanctification is not a standard of proficiency but a measure of growth.

The closer I get to God, the more my nature becomes such that I will never shoot another person, no matter what they are threatening. It’s not a pharasayical rule that I’m imposing on other people, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men; it’s just how I’m turning out. Blessed are those who are reviled for my name’s sake. If he slaps you on the cheek, turn to him the other also. The more clearly I see God, the more I am humbled, and the humbler I am, the more I will empathize with the criminal. The kind of person I want to be is a calm person. I really don’t have a doctrinal problem with war. But my war is not against flesh and blood. In my pursuit to become Spirit-filled, having a heart of thankfulness and humility and patience and love, the less I can imagine myself shooting someone who is threatening to kill my little sister. That has never happened. I don’t think it will happen. But if it does happen, I will look with compassion on my sister, knowing that it’s God who supplies every breath in that criminals lungs, and if God is giving him that heartbeat, I will not take it away. God is less powerless to kill that person than I am, and he is watching my sister in dangor, and he’s letting that man live. Who am I to be a judge over God? What you need to understand is that God is right there. I could pray down fire on the man. I could pray God to kill him instantly with worms eating his insides like when Herod took God’s glory. If it’s God’s will, he will answer. I don’t need a gun in my pocket. But I would look at my sister with compassion, and say, “Keep the faith. Deliverance has come to you today. I’ll miss you. I love you.” And that man will snuff the life out of her, and my heart will tear inside from grief, but I will not have covered my hands in blood. So many of us will kill for castle rights. I don’t know if I could. I wouldn’t feel guilty in my conscience, but I don’t know if I could hurt another person that way. Life is fragile, and it’s precious. It’s God’s handiwork, and to protect it we would destroy it. Really what we’re destroying to protect God’s handiwork it’s Satan’s handiwork in the corruption of these sinners.

People ought to be able to tell when you are grateful without you having to say, “Thank you.”

There is an error in statistics that a lot of people don’t account for, and I’ll explain it like this. Imagine I’m trying to monitor how many words per minute a recording is speaking in order to figure out what number I should multiply it by to increase it to 400 words per minute (i.e. if the recording is 200 words per minute, increase the playback speed by x2 to get a rate of 400 words per minute). When calculating my number I can’t just count the total number of words and divide it against the total number of minutes, because that would include the times the recording was talking slowly or pausing for emphasis etc. I need to calculate the average speed in the parameters above certain thresholds.

The Bible does not say, “Wrestle against fornication;” it says flee from it. You say, “Why doesn’t the Bible say, ‘Wrestle against fornication?” Because the thing that lust comes from is hardwired in us by God to enjoy our wife. It’s not something that should be desensitized, it’s just something that shouldn’t be exploited for our own twisted wicked pleasures. Things like greed or pride, by all means, desensitize them. But not sexual stimulation. That has it’s proper place in your life, but you need to be careful where you use it, in the marriage bed. That means don’t face your lust like you face your fears. If you’re scared of something, you get closer to it until you understand it. If you lust after something, flee from it. Run away like Joseph ran from Potiphar’s wife. 

“Never been laid, huh?” “Do you see a ring on my finger? No. And how dare you phrase that question to make premarital sex sound normal. It’s a wicked, vile sin, and if you’ve been laid you need to get that out of your life.”

Don’t be picky. Don’t be choosy. If you are looking for the one who is maximally compatible with you, you’d have to spend a life time with each person in the world to see who’s the best. You do not have time to find “the one.” This really takes a burden off of you that we were never meant to bear. Just find someone who’s a Christian and marry him. It’s not about making the perfect choice. Look, marriage is till death do we part. That’s not that long in light of eternity. What it’s about is being, not demanding. That’s why I’d suggest a single life anyway. But if you’re going to get married, don’t spend your whole life picking out the right one. Just find someone and make it work. A good marriage only takes one person to make the bed in the morning. If you can find someone to help you make it, great. Otherwise just make it yourself. That’s what I would do. Of course I wouldn’t get married in the first place. Marriage in compromise. Every time. It’s compromise. You have two people with conflicting interests trying to sort out and reconcile your different opinions so that you can make a decision. That’s a lot of extra needless work when you can just stay single and not worry about it. Look, I get it, “Marriage bed = best thing on earth,” but if you can just hold out for a little while, the smallest pleasure in heaven will be the greatest on earth. It’s not a sacrifice, it’s an exchange. Whatever you give up on earth you’ll receive 100 times that in heaven. So what do you want? 1 marriage, or 100 times that joy in heaven? And look, it’s not about giving up something that you currently posses. Divorce is not the point. So that we think, “Well if I can invest this $100 and pyramid it into $1 million, than at the end of my life I can give away $1 million and receive $100 million in heaven rather than just giving away the measly $100 and getting $10,000 in heaven.” That’s totally not what Jesus meant. “Get as much money as you can so tht at the end of your life you can give it all away and have rewards in heaven.” That’s not sacrifice. Do you remember what he said to the women who gave two shekels? She gave more than the rich people who offered a greater sum of money. And I don’t think it’s about percentages. We have to get our minds off of numbers and transform them to discern the will of God. Tangent. The point is if you can give up marriage on earth, it will be worth it. Both in eternity and on earth, because you’re not burdened with the things that come with marriage. The compromise, the longsuffering, the trying to figure out how to please your spouse. – But that’s part of the beauty of marriage, is displaying to the world what Christ is to the Church. You work through it, and forgive each other, and love each other, and you don’t let anything separate you. You give your lives up for each other, showing the world how Christ gave himself up for us. It’s noble. Don’t hear me saying marriage isn’t extremely valuable and precious and beautiful. It is. It’s just not the only way of life, or the best way of life to achieve those things.

Your urges and natural instincts are not you. You will have new urges at the redemption of our mortal body. Our natural inclination to do things is grounded in our nature (hence “natural” inclination). Our nature is the creature born of Adem, but there is a new man born of God. Our conscious thought is our free will. Our nature is regulated and guided by chemistry and psychological principles of behaviorism. You say, “How did we choose God?” We always had a Spirit, it was just dead it says in Ephesians 2. Dead meaning opposed to God. But God quickened our Spirit and made it alive, born again, new creation, new life, and now that one can’t sin. But he’s constantly fighting against the flesh that was born of Adam, and the flesh is responsible for your automated behavior, or your natural inclination to do things. It’s true that you can reform your nature by making your new man stronger than your old man, being transformed in the spirit of your mind (what we would call sanctification), but you will always have your first nature with you until it dies, and when it dies you will finally be free from it. That nature includes the desire to be married. The commission to be fruitful and multiply is a flesh thing, an instinct hardwired in the human psyche to keep our species alive. It’s an biological instinct for the preservation of our species. So when you say, “I’m disappointed that my natural inclination is not to be a servant, but I have to consiously override my automated behavior,” you are right to be disappointed, because you can actually change your nature, but you can’t say that your inclination to be lazy is grounded in you. It’s not. It’s grounded in your nature, and you are your conscious thought. Jesus said what profit is it to gain the whole world and lose your soul? Meaning your soul is your real self. Not your nature. So when you overrise your natural instincts for sin with your conscious decisions, don’t be disappointed that “you” aren’t making progress. You are. And it may continue to be a battle until glorification. We all have different rates of sanctification until we get there. But one of the many beautiful things about the gospel is hope. One of those hopes is glorification, that we will be like him when we see him as he is.

The Bible becomes more memorable and inciteful when you’ve heard the lies the scriptures debunk. When you read it and say, “Oh! Here’s a passage that flies in the face of that false doctrine.”

Your judgement is not right judgement, all you who call them Pharisees who love the judgements of God. With the judgement that you judge, so you will be judged. You call them Pharisees who walk in God’s ways while you search the scriptures for loopholes; it was the Pharisees who looked for loopholes. You call them Pharisees who disapprove divorce, but in Matthew 19 it was the Pharisees who justified divorce and Jesus who disapproved it. Everybody keeps making an assumption of hypocrisy, but that word has a real meaning. It’s not just inherent to every situation. If I tell you, “Don’t commit adultery,” I’m not just automatically a hypocrite for saying that. I’m a hypocrite if I do the things that I allow not, Romans 7. But, “Oh, you’ve lied? Then you can’t tell me what to do.” It’s nonsense. And you can call us Pharisees, but I’m more concerned with what God is calling me, and if I were you, I would be too.

[Kent Hovind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVrvEDG9tfM) says, “Which one did he start with? The eldest. The longer you live the more you better realize, ‘I am a sinner.’ And I would guarantee that the biggest critics on my YouTube channel are some teenage kids that want to criticize me for my choice to marry Mary Tocco, and it’s not somebody who’s lived 50 or 60 years.” But that completely disregards sanctification. (If what he meant was, “The closer you get to God the more you realize your own sin,” that would be one thing, but what he’s talking about is over time you fall pray to more sins.) The Bible says, “Let no one despise you for your youth.” But Hovind just wants to disqualify kids from making judgements against sin because, apparently because they haven’t had enough time yet to make the same bad decisions. “Let’s see what decisions you make in 40 years.” That’s foolishness. If you’re walking with the Lord you grow in righteousness, not digress. You don’t go from innocence to sinful experience in sanctification; you grow in holiness and true righteousness. But your defense is built on the presumption or hypocrisy that you’re admitting probably hasn’t even happened yet. That is not right judgement. You don’t judge people on what you think they will do later in life based on how you started off and ended up. Saul started strong and ended badly. That did not mean David would end the same way. Do you know what true hypocrisy is? Calling people hypocrites when they haven’t even violated the rules their advocating. Your “Pharisee” defense doesn’t hold any water.

Why do I work out? To teach myself principles of endurance and discipline, so that I can then transpose them in to more important areas of life. He teacheth my hands to war so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms. Righ? But my war is not against flesh and blood. Plus, this body is not my own. It belongs to God, and I need to steward it well. I want to finish well there too. Even in the way that you it. “Should I have 2 corn dogs or 3?” How does God want you to steward your body? “…VEGITABLES??”

How to disagree without being a jerk. Affirm them first. “I understand, but.” Right? “There is a logic in that that I can follow, so that I can see why you think the way that you do.”

Have you ever smelled something amazing as you walk through the door, and then you walk into the kitchen and it’s all gone? Right? Like, the source is gone, but the smell still lingers while longer. Temptation is the same way. You can remove the steak, but the smell is going to still make you want it for a little while. You can remove whatever is the fulfillment of your bad habits, but you’ll still smell it and want it a little while longer.

As laws are worthless when enforced by lawless enforcers, laws of science are nothing when uncovered by flawed scientists. We’re all prone to mistakes. “Prove” is an epistemologically naïve word.

Steward your time. Steward your body. Steward your brain. Steward your diet. Steward your money. Everything belongs to God, and if you’re in charge of it, you should know that you’re not the owner.

## Evolution

The Bible teaches evolution. God cursed the snake and said, “From now on you will crawl on your belly, you and your offspring.” The Bible teaches the sort of evolution that we see happening today. The Bible does not teach the kind of evolution that people say, “We all came from a single common ancestor.” That’s speciation, and we don’t see that. First of all, our order of “Kingdom, Phylum” etc. is not a system God uses. He uses his own system, and he said animals bring forth after their kind. Okay, what’s a kind? Species? Genus? Whatever it is, it’s probably not going to be categorically identical to our 20th century taxonomic rank. Nomenclature codes is probably not the way God defines a kind of animal. But what we see in the Bible is a kind of adaptation, God said,

Before you can talk about evolution, you have to understand DNA sequences and how they relate to the organism that uses it as a blueprint to make cells. If you don’t know what you have, you can’t talk about how it’s changed, or how those changes occur, or what those changes mean. How do we sequence DNA? How do we decipher what they mean? How do we determine a string of DNA implies something about the organism? Which identifiable genes are responsible for which traits? How can we determine a gene is new to the species? How can we predict what genes an offspring will inherit? How can offspring come to have a gene foreign to his parents? Epigenetics can explain why wolves get thicker coats in colder climates (adaptation – certain regions of the DNA (genes) turn on and off in response to particular conditions or habits), but evolution does nothing to explain it. All evolution does is observe the offspring looks different then the parent. Evolution makes inferences about the inside from the outside, just like psychology, which is a pseudoscience based on tendencies, not falsifiable statements. You can’t do anything to change your genes. If a wolf moves to a colder climate, nature doesn’t give him a new genes. Anyone who says that doesn’t know the basic biology about how genes come into being. They are inherited from parents, not magically created by conditions. So where has there been an organism that somehow gets a new gene from conditions? And what was the sequence? Tell me. You don’t expect me to just trust you. I want to know the details. What was the ACTG sequence of the new gene, and how did you determine it? I don’t expect that you’ve memorized it, but have you seen it? Or are you just trusting what somebody told you? You’ve got to bring the research to the table. Give me something material that I can look at and say, “Aha, he’s right about that.” If we can determine an offspring somehow gathered information in a gene that did not come from his parents, we need to figure out where it came from. If I spend time outside, pigments will form in my skin to protect me from sun damage. That’s not evolution, because nothing in my DNA has changed as a result of the conditions I am in. Perhaps something in my DNA was activated to alert my body of those conditions, but there’s no new information. That’s just my body’s reaction to conditions. If you can physically observe a person evolving during his lifespan, that’s not evolution. That’s adaptation. People change all the time. That’s something in our biology to preserve species, not change them. But you’re never going to get a beak out of a human. In the lab, we can add new genes to organisms, we can add ears to rats by sequencing the genes in a human that creates the ear and inserting them into a rat, but conception doesn’t work that way. Nature will never give you a gene that way. Genetic engineering depends of modifying a DNA string found in a cell, and re-growing the organism from something like an ager gel. Restrictive enzymes catalyze the formation of phosphodiester bonds at the primers of DNA strands. Tell me how that’s done in nature? You’re going to tell me the body is smart enough to self-code a new gene, store it away because you can’t use it, and then add it to the sperm cells that make offspring? It’s true what the psalmist says, “The fool has said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” I’m going to call you out on it: That’s foolish. It’s so stupid it takes an incredibly smart person to make it sound remotely tenable. Or somebody who preys on the fact that 99% of people who use the word “evolution” know virtually nothing about genetics, which is what evolution is all about.

Google “New Genes.” “DNA duplication mechanisms include small-scale events, such as the duplication of chromosomal segments containing whole genes or gene fragments (termed segmental duplication), which are essentially outcomes of misguided recombination processes _during meiosis_ (Fig. 1A).”[[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2945180/) That sounds like a mistake, not a beneficial addition of new information kindled by the conditions in which an organism lives. Nobody is denying mutations. Sometimes things go wrong, sometimes genes can get wacked up. But those drive a species to extinction, not transcendence. Did you notice, “During meiosis”? It has to happen in the sperm, at conception. That’s a small window for natural selection to analyze the conditions of an organism and say, “These traits are necessary for survival in these conditions, so I’ve coded this gene to help out with that. Happy birthday and best wishes.” I don’t buy for one second any of that. I’m going to need concrete documentation and proof of the results in the lab that published this research. It sounds very nefarious to me that a new gene can materialize out of nothing. That’s fiction, not reality. Or supernatural, not science. “The early notions that gene duplication provides a significant reservoir for the emergence of genes and hence phenotypic adaptation have now been globally confirmed (but also refined) based on numerous large- and small-scale molecular studies that were facilitated by the genomics revolution. New duplicate genes have been shown to be abundant in all eukaryotic genomes sequenced to date and to have evolved pivotal functional roles ([Lynch 2007](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2945180/#B57)). Wait—Your evidence for phenotypic adaptation is that eukaryotic organisms have different but similar DNA? I’m looking for something where we don’t have to extrapolate back to confirm. I don’t want to impose my theory on something that’s already happened, I want to test it with something falsifiable. I need to watch it happen, not make inferences based on assumptions that can’t be falsified. That has no place in science. If that’s our standard, it’s just as authentic to say, “Common designer,” not “Common ancestor.” “However, studies from the genomics era have also accelerated the discovery of fascinating novel mechanisms underlying the emergence of new genes. _These include the origin of new protein-coding and RNA genes “from scratch” (that is, from previously nonfunctional genomic sequences),_ various types of gene fusions, and the formation of new genes from RNA intermediates.” Okay, so this is epigenetics, not new information. There were inactive genes in the parent, and it was chosen as one of the genes to be carried over to the offspring, which became an active gene. Epigenetics, not evolution. You need to give me a list of all the genes in both parents and a list of all the genes in the offspring before you can tell me there’s a new gene. If you just look at traits and extrapolate backwards you’re going to miss something because a particular gene may not have been active in the parent, although it was still there. These so-called credible sources just can’t step away from, “It is now well established,” or “Globally confirmed,” because it’s all appeals to authority instead of research. There is nothing more annoying than when a scholar who should know better doesn’t present the evidence, and doesn’t explain the research, but instead summarizes the conclusions. This kind of appeal depends on the assumption that people are good; I operate on the assumption that people are good liars and we need to fact-check everything.

“Well, excommunication would be the result of dishonesty, so no worries.” Then why don’t you just present the evidence? Are you that lazy? That you just assume everybody is intellectually honest and because if they’re caught there would be dire consequences? And therefore, there’s no need to fact check them? That’s a special kind of stupidity, and it doesn’t pan out in society. Criminals can get away with crimes, scholars can get away with dishonesty. The trick is to do it well, and when you’ve got people like you saying, “There’s no need to check what they’re saying is true,” it makes it a lot easier to get away with it. We live in a world with cameras and pictures and extremely accessible documentation _on our cell phones_. We shouldn’t have to rely on what people say. “How many scholars do you expect to lie?” How many priests do you expect to molest children? But it happens. All the time. People who write for credible journals have a pay check, and they need to be read to keep their jobs. Nobody is above lackadaisical work, nobody is above bias, and nobody is above the love of money. Letters before a name doesn’t ensure anything. Give me the details, not the references. If you really can’t summarize the research in a simple and concise enough way to include in your paper, what are you doing writing for a living? “I can’t believe you’re do quick to completely disregard this beautiful system we have. You’re a disgrace to science.” I can’t believe you’re naïve enough not to. You just trust people because they have a PhD? Because they write for a paper that a someone decided was “credible”? That doesn’t make any kind of sense. “The way that it works is, _well if you can show something to be true, then it’s true_. But no, that’s not the way that it works. You have something called peer review, where basically, if you have an idea, like Einstein’s relativity wasn’t accepted for decades in the scientific community, and to this day there’s people that question it. Why? Because really it’s not so much about what you show to be truth, the evidence and so forth, it’s all about what the community accepts. And if the community as a whole has this cognitive bias, already you’re only going to look at that evidence that supports your bias. This totally is happening in the world of science. And so anybody that doesn’t really fall into the mainstream science view is automatically going to be marginalized, they’re going to be labeled as flat earthers or whatever; you can’t question in almost. And there’s very high-ranking scientists with PhD’s and so forth that buck the system occasionally, and they can be ostracized if they don’t have the party-line, as it were, on certain ideas. Which is too bad because I think a better learning environment is where all the evidence is out on the table.” ~ Jesse Smith

In other words, you don’t have an answer. I’m disappointed that you used so many words responding to my question, and I still don’t understand the material resolution to the problem I’ve posed. That tells me you’re just sidestepping, not interested in actually pursuing a deeper, fuller, more true understanding about this issue. You just want to believe what you want to believe because the implications of it suit you. It’s something in philosophy, not science. That’s very disappointing to me, in the same way as if I was in the desert hoping to quench my thirst, and I found an oasis with water, and I ran to it and it turned out to be a mirage. You have not quenched my curiosity. You only gave me the illusion that you have an answer, but when I got there, there was nothing there. I am very disappointed that you’re all rhetoric with nothing substantial to say, Dawkins. “Thousands of pieces of evidence. It’s a fact.” And when I pushed you for it, you gave me nothing. You’re just a mirage. Nothing more. Promising water when there is none. But Jesus, he offers living water, and when you drink from it you’ll never thirst again. I found substance with him. But not with you. You earned my respect when I was 14 and angry at the church, but now I rescind that respect. All you did was exploit a hatred in me, and stir it up. Not anymore. I’ve realized you are bankrupt in the realms of intellectual honesty. I don’t hope you go to hell. I hope you open your eyes and open your ears and see what’s true. Best wishes. Your friend, Ethan.

Every Christian who has read their Bible should have picked up on the simple narrative that we do not live in the world God created (that is, in the world _as_ God created it).

I’ve heard a lot of people say that, but I’ve never actually heard a coherent objective. Care to take a swing at being the first to undermine that tradition? “Debunk” is the buzz word of atheists, because they don’t actually have arguments, they just have authoritative appeals. “This person said this.” Wake up. We’re in the 21st century, the age of information, where more false information is reported than accurate information, as evinced by the 2016 election. Vertasium has a video about that, also Epiphany gets at it with this overload of information. As Lawrence Kraus puts in, “In science there are no authorities.” You have to give me something of substance, otherwise your position violates the oversight of faith atheists typically accuse theists of having. There are two ways to approach hypocrisy when you discover it in yourself: change it or deny it. The first is intellectually honest. The second, well, not so much.

It’s conceivable to me that docking and receptor proteins may be responsible for genetic modification in the context of detrimental virus like situations, but not evolution. There you could add information, but that’s still not natural selection. Remember when Jacob made that deal with Laban about the spotted cattle and the non spotted cattle? He used that principle of conditionary adaptation to get the strongest cattle. The rods (conditions) produced reignsaked and speckled offspring (subsequent trait). Jacob capitalized on it. It’s how he made money, and we're going to say evolution contradicts the Bible? That's nonsense. Adaptation is there. Epigenetics is the. It’s speciation that's in conflict, and speciation is fiction. Or again, inz Genesis 6, you have angels mating with humans to create a new offspring, called nephilum. Or in Exodus you have the prohibition of mixing seeds. What's that about if species don't adapt to conditions and interbreed to make new species? The Bible talks about grafting, and pruning, and letting the land rest every seventh year, all of which have their roots in adaptation. Jesus said some men are born eunuchs. Hmm. That's very interesting. You mean his genome was mutated?  God said I formed you in the womb. God, evidently, plays a role in recombination. Did you know the Bible says that our sin nature is hereditary? It talks about being regenerated, from the word genes. It talks about the children of God vs the children of the devil.

The Bible is perfectly willing to acknowledge evolutionary concepts. You see the giant that had 6 fingers. How did that happen? A mistake in recombination. That's evolution. Is it that natural selection made the finches have larger beaks, or the finches with larger beaks simply survived better than the finches with smaller beaks?

I challenge you to do this when you look at these papers: press them for their sources, look at the details of the research, and what you’ll find is these so-called genetic novelties are nothing more than epigenetics, mutations, and mistakes in recombination during meiosis. There’s never any beneficial new Gene that was foreign from the parent that helps it survive. It can have active genes that were inactive in the host, but it is still inherited, not coded by some mysterious force called natural selection to help it survive. Nature doesn't code anything novel. Really press for the findings, go deep, and I guarantee that is what you'll find. Read things carefully. Filter out the headlines and conclusion and deal solely with the research. The emperor is not wearing any clothes.

## Evolution End (Temporary Reference)

You’re confusing things. We were friends. I mean we were mean to each other, but it was always within the realms of civility. In a, “If it really came down to it, [pause], I wouldn’t take a bullet for you, but I’d shoot someone for you,” kind of way.

All that go unto her house return not again, neither take they hold of the paths of like. But I’m here to tell you that you have a visiter at her house that heard where you were, and he’s knocking on the door, and if you hear him, and open the door, he will show you the paths of life. You say, “Well that’s not what the Bible says.” Listen, that’s my application of that verse, not my interpretation. The reason I don’t interpret this verse to extend to all situations of sexual sin is because in God’s law you would get stoned for committing adultery. So quite literally, all who go to her house never reach the paths of life. It’s not talking about addiction. It’s talking about death. If you commit adultery, you will be put to death, so don’t do it, Solomon is saying. He is not saying that if you look at pornography you will get addicted and it will be impossible for you to return to purity again, and therefore you will not reach the paths of eternal life. What did John say? If we confess our sins, he is just and faithful to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. Or David: purify me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me and I shall be whiter than snow. What’s that if it’s impossible to return? The reason I use that verse in this eisegetical context is because it’s a good reminder that, almost a parallel, that, “Hey, when you indulge your lust after a habit-breaking period of time, it is very hard to stop.” It’s not a rule, it’s a reminder.

Why were people surprised when jesus taught as one with authority if the Pharisees taught for doctrines the commandments of men?

It isn’t hypocrisy to call someone out for doing something that you do. It’s hypocrisy to call someone out for doing it, and then refuse to be called out for doing the same thing. That’s hypocrisy. Semantically, sure, it’s just doing what you do not allow. The first line of hypocrisy is when you impose a standard of exegesis on others that you don’t use, because you’re transgression a line that you don’t allow others to cross. The second line of hypocrisy (and the worse of it) is when someone imposes your own standard on you, and you refuse to comply with it, because you’re not allowing them to call you out when you allow yourself to call them out. The first line of hypocrisy is corrective, which has virtue. The second line is protective against correction, devoid of virtue. So there is virtuous hypocrisy and unvirtuous hypocrisy. Let’s understand the difference. One of them says, “You should do what’s right.” Another kind says, “I don’t need to do what’s right.”

## Vertical Farming

The people that are going to end world hunger are going to be the farmers. People say, “You can’t do business that way.” Absolutely you can. WinRAR has shown that. What WinRAR has done is allowed an infinite 40 day trial for their product that allows users to use their product for free forever, and they make more money than any other competing product on the market. Why? Because people will buy even if they can get it for free. Commercial businesses will buy it out of legality, individuals will buy it out of values coupled with ability, or out of guilt; but the bottom line is you can actually give your product away and still make money. Why would people buy food from commercial businesses that buy it from farmers if they could get it for free? Because they can afford it. You say, “That sounds nice, but it won’t pan out.” Absolutely there will be people that exploit it. No question. But there will also be people who play by the rules, and there will be enough people who play by the rules to sustain flourishing business. Why? Look, work is hard, but people who don’t work get depressed. A paycheck is not the only incentive. People are going to start realizing this. We live in a world today where only a small percent of the population actually needs to work to create enough goods for the whole world to have a decent life. I believe the number of people that will work out of choice rather than necessity will exceed the number of people that are necessary to fulfil all stages of Maslow’s hierarchy. People want something to do. There will be incentives to work besides climbing up Maslow’s hierarchy. I believe that. Especially in the church. There is no reason that the church shouldn’t live in community (a capitalist twist on communism, or voluntary communism, as it were) like they did at the beginning. Members of a church who are being maintained by the church under a pastor who is helping them grow in sanctification will obey the commands in the Bible that the pastor is responsible for enumerating. I believe that. They will work. “If a man would not work, neither let him eat.” That’s Bible. There is no philosophy of mine that can argue with it. I can’t just say, “I believe every person is entitled to the basic necessities of survival that are enumerated in Maslow’s hierarchy.” I can’t even say a person should have that, because I’d be arguing with the Bible and I’m smart enough to know that God’s smarter than me. But I will say this: in Paul’s day a famer could grow enough food for about 10 people. Everybody needed to work or you’d end up like James Town. Today, a hundred fold. Technology works for us. Our intelligence works for us. We grow 100 fold the food for a small fraction of the work it used to take. That’s astonishing. Maybe, just perhaps, if Paul was here today, he might’ve said something different. “If a man would not work, take away his TV.” Maybe. “If a man would not work, neither let him have access to the highest stages of Maslow’s hierarchy provided by the church.” “If a man would not work, neither will he rejoice.” Because he will be depressed. I don’t know. That’s not what the Bible says, so I’m not going to get carried away. But I think we need to be mindful that perhaps, just maybe, when Jesus said, “Feed the hungry, clothe the naked,” he meant it. Inside the church, if people aren’t getting it, then we can take measures. Paul was way more strict with believers than unbelievers. John asid pure and undefiled religion is this: caring for the orphans and widows. Let’s do that. Let’s distribute the incredible wealth we have to the the world so that we can all climb Maslow’s hierarchy together. The higher up people are, the greater technology they will have, and the greater technology they posses, the more efficient their work will be, and the more efficient their work becomes, the wealthier the world will be. Think about how much work is wasted in third world countries. Imagine a whole village out there with their machetes cutting grass every month, when one person with a lawn mower could get the job done with less work every single week. It isn’t surreal to you, but there are countless hours of wasted work being poured out across the globe because people don’t have more efficient technology. We need to advance. Listen, if all the labor hours in these countries translated into American labor hours, into collegiate labor hours, the world would be so wealthy we wouldn’t know what to do with our wealth. We might start taking care of the earth better. We might start using more solar energy. The reason we don’t is because to advance the technology, startup costs are very expensive. If it takes 1000 labor hours to cut grass, and the same job can be done in 10 labor hours with a lawn mower (both more time efficient and quality effective), that frees up 990 labor hours to put towards something else. Even if we assume 90% of people just drop out of the workforce, which I think is an absurdly untrue number, you’re still 99 labor hours ahead of the game than if you don’t equip them with the lawn mower. Those 99 labor hours can be used towards other inputs. In accounting, labor hours is your dominant cost driver, and there are 8 types of waste. Let’s cut down the waste and start motivating people to work because they want to. I have a project called “Till” that I think will create herder working people than a paycheck could dream to. Work begins in the mind. It begins with philosophy. Let’s address that instead of this operant conditioning way of doing things, “Here, I’ll give you this chocolate if you’ll do this thing even though it’s completely unrelated.” That’s not the future. The future is math, and business, and psychology, and theology, and technology. It’s Khan Academy and individualized learning, not coerced learning. It’s Till and individualized working, not coerced working. I won’t get to see this happen before I die, but I will witness the beginning the a paradigm shift that will change the world. All of my words will be lost in a our-of-control array of information being imposed on the world. So I won’t waste my time writing; the only way I’ll see this change is by talking and persuading and doing.

Listen, I’m not a communist. Things need to be voluntary, that’s why I’m using words and persuasion instead of a gun. I’m not trying to persuade the people who have guns to use them to steal from wealthy people and give to poor people. That’s not what I’m about. What I’m about is persuading the wealthy people directly to live their lives this way. Not persuading someone who can coerce wealthy people to live this way at the end of a gun point. That’s not communism, that’s anarchy. Straight up. (Well, okay, so it’s called “communism,” but that word is too beautiful to be used that way. It’s essentially, “Community-ism,” and that is too nice a word to belong to such a horrendous philosophy.)

Politics is always a question of psychology, because it’s about people. It’s about our shared life together. It’s about how we will behave in response to certain ideologies, certain policies, certain laws and regulations. How can we govern our shared life together to stipulate it in such a way that we take care of each other? Government’s job is to make itself unnecessary. Let’s address the mind. How we function as a society and as people will depend on the values, the philosophies, and the learning that determines the way that we think. Education (not grades, and history, and algebra, but enlightenment, ispiration, seeing the world in a new, beautiful and true way) is ultimately the foundation of our future. Hitler said, “Whoever owns the youth owns the future.” Paychecks are not the most influential force in the world. Ideas are. That’s where we need to begin if we want to change the world. Look at Jesus: he changed the world with words. Yes, he did miracles. Yes, he died and rose from the dead to save them that are perishing, and that is the outshining, outstanding, emphasis and point of the gospel, and I don’t want to water that down in the slightest when I say this: The way Jesus changed the world was with words. With ideas. He got inside the motivations and work ethics and patience, ultimately the mind and way of thinking of other people by using words. They’re so powerful, and we need to realize that. We literally have the power to change minds, to shape the motivations of our future, of our youth, and we just want to say wave a paycheck in their face and say, “I’ll give you this if you do something useful.”? That’s borderline criminal. It’s the easy way out. It’s, ironically, lazy. You are being lazy in the way you get people to work when you reduce the motivation of working to, “I’ll give you a reward.” Work for reward. What about the making something? I think one of the value distortions (i.e. when someone pays me $200 dollars to make a video, my eyes widen and say, “Is the value of $200 worth of food actually equivalent to a 3 minute video?” Maybe. You need to somehow quantify the value of a video in terms of and in relation to something else (like $200 of food).  It depends on the value of the idea that the video is presenting in comparison with what $200 can otherwise buy. Otherwise I’d say, “Nope, won’t take that much, because this video is not that valuable) in the world is that people don’t think of their labor hours to product ratio in terms of what it could be. They don’t think of what they’re doing, what they’re producing, what they’re making. I wrote a paper about this same principle of operant conditioning in relation to the education system, and I opposed it there too, receiving a 100. I don’t have personal-gain biases against it. I flourished in school. I think it’s ineffective. And so is the way we’re doing work. That is, the way we’re spending our hours, getting money, spending money, etc. We need first of all to learn to quantify value to some standard so that we can quantify some standard of labor hours to product ratio, so that we can then determine which kinds of work are more useful than other kinds, which kinds we should improve, and which kinds we should tell people: this is valuable work. Currency isn’t doing that accurately because it’s all based on what people are willing to pay, and that’s completely subjective. There’s no actual intrinsic value associated with a product in regards to its usefulness. Sales men, business men, all kinds of people are really good at making something appear more valuable than it is. This causes value distortions and that makes some professions seem more valuable than they are, and people need to know how valuable their work is. We need to be able to evaluate that objectively in terms of what we’re producing. Arbitrary things like ideas, or intangible things like services are harder to weigh against goods on a scale, but there has got to be a way to do it. I’m going to think about that during my free time (if ever I come to some). The reason I want accurate evaluations is not for reasons of trade: “Hey, I make pants, all you make is hats. That’s not a fair trade!” but for reasons people being able to make informed decisions about how their time will be most effectively used.

“Well then you’d have to evaluate literally millions of professions.” Impracticality is never a reason to veto an idea that has the potential to revolutionize the world and end world hunger. Impossibility is worth considering. Impracticality is not. Everything should be done with as much math as possible. As much objectivity and and defined standards as possible. String theory is an attempt to put all the laws of science into a single string of equations (or rather, a single-string equation). Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. Rules simplify the inputs that go into them. We can’t let value be subjective or the usefulness of our time will be nebulous and we’ll make unwise decisions.

The wisest decisions we can make are those decisions which produce a product that lasts forever. There’s 4 catigories of things to spend your money on: things that last a few hours, things that last a few years, things that last a lifetime, and things that last for eternity. Each of those things becomes more valuable as it moves up the list. A car is worth more than a piece of candy. An education is worth more than a car. Saving a soul from eternal anguish is worth more than an education. If we want to be wise with our time, we will recognize the most useful thing we can do, the highest labor-hour to product ratio is things that we do that the product is eternal, because then we’re plugging a value of “infinite” into the numerator. Let’s learn to discern the will of God and do it. That’s the most valuable thing you can do. I’ll save you lifetimes of trouble and summarize it: “Only one life, twill soon be past / Only what’s done for Christ will last.” None of us should get so caught up with saving the world from hunger that we neglect to save them from eternal hunger. If we give them water, they will thirst again. If we give them living water, they will be quenched forever. What’s more valuable? “Thy Kingdom come on earth as it is in heaven.” The Kingdom is a people. Every Kingdom is. We are the Kingdom of God, and it’s his ambition for us to love here the way we will live there. Do we become so heavenly minded that we’re earthly useless? We become so heavenly minded that we’re earthly amazing. We have to get that right. We can’t spend so much time reading the Bible that we never have time to do what’s it’s telling us. Part of what it tells us is to take care of the needy as if it were Christ. Are we going to say to Jesus if we saw him naked and hungry, “If you will not work, neither shall you eat!” Or, “Be fed, and be warm,” and do nothing? I don’t know about oyu, but I would make haste to feed him and clothe him. Why aren’t we running to third world countries to do it for them? Jesus said whatever you do for them, you did for me. I believe that. We should all believe that. But none of us live like we believe it. It’s time to change that. (And in your heart you’re going, “Yeah! Woohoo!” but when I give you practical steps to take, you’re heart drops a little, because you’ve been convicted, and you don’t want to live by it.)

I think a fairly practical standard to weigh labor hours against is a modified version of Maslow’s hierarchy, nested with a function of Kent Hovind’s categories of value against time.

People like Elon Musk, Derek Muller, Kahn; these are our future. A future where education portal is free and accessible and provided to everybody so that they have the means to increase the value of their labor hours by increasing their knowledge and skill.

## Qualification (PhD are just three letter)

I need someone with a voice to say all this for me, because apparently being smart isn’t good enough, you have to have letters before your name. We live in a world where that does not need to be the case at all. Letters before a name means you didn’t have the discipline to study independently, so you needed to hire someone to keep you on track. There is a world of information, and you don’t need to get a PhD to be exposed to the high standards of scholarship and research scholars are expected to adhere to (and in some cases, don’t). I can access J-store, evaluate credibility, find credible sources, do proper research, evaluate positive and negative control groups, and have the basic knowledge that Wikipedia isn’t going to cut it without ever walking into a school. Being smart about the way you do research isn’t hidden and only accessible by virtue of someone else telling you. You can access more quality information on Google than in a classroom. You can read textbooks without being in a class where you listen to the lecture and never actually open the textbook. How many college students say that every semester? “I never even bought the book.” I heard it all the time. I even started out that way, because you frankly didn’t need them. But the information in them was more valuable, I learned, then the information in lectures. I can learn either route. I’m a visual, audial, kinesthetic learner. I can do distance learning, I can do face to face. It’s all the same to me. Which is rare. But I can do it. I get A’s no matter what. Either route. The point is you don’t need to go to college to be an independent researcher. “People call me the Erin Brockovich of this industry because I’m not a doctor, I’m an independent researcher who has a passionate mission. Just as Erin Brockovich was not an attorney, but she was responsible for the largest class action lawsuit to ever hit this country” ([Tocco](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjGYgvnbJbM&t=166s&list=WL&index=143)). “Well, you didn’t follow MLA format. How unscholarly.” Yeah, because MLA format came from an outdated system before hyperlinks where you had to go to a library and pick out the resource by the information provided if you wanted to fact check. Now you can pull up the resource with the click of a button. “Well they don’t know if it’s a credible source or not.” First of all, don’t pretend anybody has every credible journal memorized. Second, I am still providing that information in the footnotes, where you don’t have to go all the way to the bibliography to check them. Thirdly, FACT CHECK. I could be lying about where I got the source. Students do it all the time. I know because my friends were students, and they did it. I did it. Hyperlinks are a good way of making things a lot easier and with a tighter grip on the facts. “It’s a book.” At least hyperlink to it in a college library or something. Now that you can hyperlink, Chicago style makes for sense in my opinion. It’s more seamless. Maybe when someone doesn’t follow standards, it’s because they’ve found a better way of doing it. These are the people who make things better in the world, who advance standards, and progress innovation. We need people without degrees, people who had the discipline and aptitude to do it themselves. In my opinion, that’s more prestigious than a doctrinal thesis. “We need some system of recognition so we know who to trust.” Here’s a thought: Don’t trust anyone. We don’t need to anymore. We have information at our fingertips. How stupid our we to assume somebody can be trusted because they got a PhD? Did they lose the ability to lie? Are they just above biases now? That’s nonsense. Degree or no degree, we should be analyzing the arguments, not the person offering them. It’s just inverse ad hominem. Instead of “Against the man,” it’s “Trust the man if he has three letters before his name.” Letters before a name does not make the argument good. The argument makes the argument good. The logic makes the argument good. That’s why Plato said it’s the only necessity. Ethos and Pathos are tools of persuasion, not tools of good argumentation. Persuasion basically means: I’m going to nudge your beliefs with something other than sound reasoning. It’s manipulation. Persuasion that uses ethos and pathos is deceptive. It’s getting you to believe something without regards to the facts. It elicits emotions. He causes you to overlook things because you trust the person presenting. All of that is manipulation. That should never be used. We should allow people the liberty of analyzing only the facts, unadulterated, no sugarcoating, to nudging, no biases and produces. Persuasion by ethos and pathos is the offspring of confirmation bias. If the facts check out, let them make their own decisions. I’m not going to appeal to emotions and my own credibility to make an argument. Here’s what I think, if you like it, great, if not, let’s talk about it. But I’m not going to manipulate an audience to believe something by using persuasion tactics. That’s what people who have something to hide do. That’s what the Hitler’s of the world do. That is not what good scholarship does. Period. Good teachers give you the facts and let you draw the conclusions. Good studies give you the facts and tell you what they think about what it infers, but they don’t make the conclusion equal to the facts. We need to get out of this mindset that people need to have gone to college to be heard. There is nothing you can learn at college that you can’t learn without it. There are a plethora of YouTube comments that agree, “I’ve learned more on YouTube then my entire collegiate career.” I can attest to that.

In YouTube education they tell you to start where you’re audience is at, so I’ve done my best to simplify things, but this is either going to work, or it’s not.

## Learning “Disabilities”

So-called learning disabilities are no excuse to not learn. Albert Einstein had dyslexia. Many of the world’s most accomplished scholars had learning “disabilities.”  All there has to be is one exception to show that these people have the ability to learn. Disability means they don’t have the ability, and that’s why I have a problem with it. “Learning hindrance” I wouldn’t cringe at so much, but still a little, because it’s devised mainly as an excuse for people who claim them to say, “See, it’s not that I’m not trying, it’s that I can’t do it.” Maybe. But more often you’re just lazy with your mind like people can be lazy with their hands. There are no excuses. You have dyslexia? You just raised the bar of expectation to Albert Einstein’s intelligence. If he can do it, you can do it. Just don’t listen to traditional teaching methods that are unsympathetic to your way of learning. Teach yourself to learn, and you will excel. My sister had a learning disability. But you know what? She was also lazy in other areas of life. Undisciplined and unplanned and very anti-goal oriented. I don’t think she had a disability. I think she was mentally lazy, not mentally challenged. Listen, thinking challenges everybody. Some people push through it, some people give up. It’s like anything in life. Don’t be lazy. Don’t get frustrated. Discipline takes more patience then anything else. More important than planning, then will power, is patience. People that call themselves mentally disabled are just lazy. Just like people who lose at running call themselves slow. People that lose arm wrestling don’t make the excuse, “it’s not fair because you’re stronger than me.” He worked to get strong. Don’t tell me about what’s fair until you’ve labored to get where I am. I hate it when people say, “You’re just really smart and Deborah has learning disabilities,” because that subtly implies that it was just easy for me. Like it just came naturally for me. No, I worked hard for it! I pressed my brain to the limits when we did flash cards as kids. It takes a lot of work for me to listen and concentrate on things. But I worked at it, and I overcame the pushback by making decisions to keep on doing it even when my brain felt like it’s prefrontal cortex needed a fire extinguisher. I used to get headaches all the time. I read at about 100 words per minute. That’s slower than many people with dyslexia! But I keep on reading. Being smart isn’t something I was just born with. I worked for it. And when you make the distinction, “Deborah has learning disabilities and Ethan is smart,” I cringe because I worked for it and Deborah was lazy. Maybe she did spend more time studying then me. It’s because she spent less effort then me. Less work forcing herself to concentrate then I did. She was slack with her work, and therefore it took her longer. I was trained to work hard. And look where we are now: I wake up at 5:30 in the morning. She wakes up whenever she feels like it. She takes naps. She’s tired all the time. She doesn’t read her Bible. She doesn’t really do anything. It’s the same principle. I spent years sleeping in past noon. I had major trouble waking up in high school. My eyes were so heavy in the morning I could barely muster the strength to open them. But I memorized verses, and I listened to sermons, and I asked for a wake-up light for my birthday, and I researched techniques to wake up, and ultimately now I can wake up with energy because I pushed myself past the tiredness, and my body said, “If I’m going to have to work anyway I’m just going to quit this tired game.” I take cold showers. I run in the morning to teach myself endurance. You can tell me I was just born smart and Deborah was born with a learning disability, but the truth is I made decisions to be competitive and to work hard and to push past my limits, and Deborah made decisions to be lazy, and everything about our lives testifies to that. “Introvert vs. extrovert.” Stop it. Your brain is not the essence of your intelligence or your conscious thought. Your brain does not make decisions. You do. Wisdom comes from God. Let him that lacks wisdom ask God.

“Wow, you’re strong! You were just born with the natural tendency to get strong. This weak person over here was just unfortunate to be

The biggest problem in the world today is laziness. I used to say it was pornography, but now I say it’s laziness. Because you know why people do pornography? It’s because they’re lazy. You say, “How does that connect?” Listen, God said to Cain, who was offering the inferior fruit, “If thou doest well shalt though not be accepted? And if thou doest not well sin layeth at the door.” Idle hands are the devil’s workshop. When you’re lazy, and you’re not being fruitful, then there will be other sins like lust in your life. If you’re busy, and you’re working hard, and you labor in travail night and day, you suddenly don’t have time to do pornography, and you learn principles of discipline that enable you to guard your heart with all diligence, having verses to say like, “Keep mine eyes away from beholding vanity; and quicken thou me in thy way.” Jesus said the fruitful branch will be pruned that it may bear more fruit. As you begin to work for the Lord, God will cut out the sins in your life. But if you’re lazy, and you aren’t being fruitful, you will be cut off. You’re not going to be in communion with Jesus because your sins will distort your vision of him, so even if you’re not hindered by a seared and condemned conscience that keeps you away out of shame, you still won’t have a good relationship because it’s the pure in heart that see God. If you want to stop doing porn, get to work. Stop wasting time, be wise about your time like it says in Ephesians 5. Budget you hours. Even if you’re young you should have at least 8 labor hours everyday applied towards studying to qualify you for work, in addition to the hours you spend to grow in the knowledge of God. As a child, you must learn to read. If you can’t read, work on it for hours during the day. Grow in patience and forbearance. People will tell you not to overdo it. They’re wrong. The Bible says, “Even a child is known by his doing, whether his work be pure.” Don’t spend your days playing all day; get to work. “Oh they need to work on their imagination!” How about let’s get them to work on their wisdom? Imagination isn’t half as useful as wit, intelligence, the ability to critically think about things and analyze things and work hard. We need to stop telling kids to follow their passions and start telling them to follow opportunity and take their passions with them. Reading is not going to hinder children’s imaginations. It’s going to open them in maturity and enlightenment. Raw imagination is not useful. It needs to be guided and refined and matured, and when kids have a hard work ethic, they will succeed. I don’t think you should go to school out of expectation. You should choose it. You say, “How do you get a child to pursue a hard work ethic and study habits without coercion and pressured expectation?” Try inspiring them. There are other incentives. You can get kids fundamentally excited about the innate qualities of study. You don’t have to use operant conditioning. I used to play Jump Start and Reader Rabbit and all kinds of games. I didn’t even know it was for education. But I think you can get kids to make decisions that are healthy for them. Kids are not incapable of wisdom. We’re just too often incapable of seeing things the way they are, the way a child can understand it, and we don’t explain them well. But we can. We can labor for explanations to make our children wise. It’s we who are lazy, too often. It is coercion that’s lazy. Inspiring someone, building them up, making them excited, that’s hard. But that is what’s worth it. Kids are naturally very curious. They search for answers without your coercion. Sometimes it’s best if we let them ask the questions and let them search for the answers. Kids are naturally curious, but we can desensitize them by bombarding them with our own questions that they don’t care about. Education has to move in the direction of the individual. It is time for us to realize this.

When Jesus said the popular words, “It is more blessed to give than to receive,” we automatically think of money, but he did not say money. Think of how easy that would be. If we just gave people $5 as we were walking buy and that would fulfil that commandment. That would be really easy. That’s not what Jesus is talking about. I should say that’s not all Jesus is talking about. God so loved the world that he gave his only son. So first off we see that the reason we give is because we love. That’s the first observation. But imagine if God looked down from heaven and saw us helpless people who were going to have to pay for our sin, and he says, “That’s tough, but here’s a million dollars. Have a nice life.” And we live and die and go to hell. But that’s not what God did. He saw us, he knew that our problem was bigger than money, and he paid our debt with the blood of his son. That’s a lot harder than just paying money. Imagine in the story Abraham when God told him to offer up his son, imagine if God gave him a choice: “give me your son, or you can redeem him with all your livestock.” Do you think for one second Abraham would have walked up that mountain to offer up his son? No way. Isaac was his only son. Jesus command doesn’t stop with money. When you see someone, and you walk by and say, “Here’s $5, have a nice day and God bless,” that is exponentially less valuable then offering them your time. What if, everyone you run into, you try to give something to them? Whether it’s a word of encouragement, whether it’s a compliment, whether it’s asking them if you can pray for them and praying for them right there, maybe giving something financially, but the bottom line is you’re living all day long as a giver. When you go through a day just trying to give, “Let me give them something,” give them your attention, give them your heart, give them your ear, it’s amazing how filled up you get, and how good it is to be a giver, and how it’s like you’ve got this endless supply when you’re constantly giving. It’s about giving more than money. I’m not saying that all we do is say, “Be warm; be fed,” and then don’t actually help them out. That’s not what I’m saying. What I’m saying is that most people you run into are going to benefit more from your attention and heart and ear than your pocket book. Words are more powerful than money, and so is listening. People are struggling all the time, but it’s not because of a famine of produce, it’s a famine of encouragement. It’s a famine of joy. It’s a famine of friendship. Maybe it’s a famine of wisdom. Whatever it is, you always have something to give people to spur them on, and it’s an endless supply. Paul said, “I wish to come to you that I may impart to you some spiritual gift (that is, that we may be mutually encouraged by each other’s faith).” Give more than money.

The Bible never tells us to spend all of our hours reading the Bible. It’s a book about doing. We need to start thinking of our hours like a budget. We need to apply some of it towards food, some towards other things. Our hours are numbered. The Bible says, “Teach us to number our days.” Let’s not think of it as “Well I have this big hazy piece of time at the end of my work hours that I can just sort of do whatever I want until I go to bed.” That’s not numbering your days. Being wise with your time. We need to be wise. We need to temper things.

Before you can figure out, “How much value am I responsible for creating during my life based on how much I consume?” you have to answer, “How long will I live?”

I am so grateful for my red beard. I don’t like red beards, but if it hadn’t been for my red beard, I don’t know if I ever would have seen myself as able to pursue a life free from the burden of marriage. We don’t understand the purity, and holiness, and sanctity of a life of singleness. I am so happy now. Way happier than before. It’s so much easier to keep myself from lustful thoughts. And I do. This began when I started to see myself in a way that wasn’t sore to look at, but devoid of sexual attraction, thanks to pheomelanin and the texture / pores of my skin. When I began to embrace the look, realizing Jesus was without form or comeliness, and that it was no advantage to Clayton Jennings to be a beautiful creature like Lucifer, I began to chuckle slightly as I walk pass the mirror. My lips spring up a little. I look exactly the way I want to, adorning myself in respectable apparel, with modesty and self-control, with what is proper to profess godliness. I can see myself doing ministry in this tent. The charge from God carries with it the connotation of thoughtful, serious use of a person’s mind as to how to make his apparel speak about his godliness. We should all ask that question: How is the way I look speaking about my godliness? Clothing is not a matter of indifference in God’s economy. It speaks about a person’s view of God and his own commitments to God and joy in God and freedom from the manipulative maneuvers of Satan to make you just like him, being corrupted by your own beauty, or otherwise the beauty of others.

Let me tell you about him. In the beginning, God created a world for us to inhabit, and there was beauty, and there was wonder, and God blessed it and he said it was good. Creation was dynamic, not static. It wasn’t just, “God creates trees,” it’s God creates trees and endows them with the ability to within themselves make more trees. And then he made us, he made man, and he put us in the middle of it to properly order and rule creation. And he didn’t just make man as a ruler, he made him in God’s own image. God is love, he created us in the image of love, and selflessness. He’s the Lion and the Lamb, the perfect balance of fierceness and gentles, innocence and experience rolled up into one. And he made Adam with all of those qualities. Fierce and masculine, and soft, and feeling. But God saw that Adam was alone, and he said, “It is not good for man to be alone,” so he put Adam into a deep sleep and the Lord took hasela from Adam, the Hebrew word for side, he took a side of Adam, and it says he made Eve with it, dividing his image into two parts, the Lion and the Lamb, man and women. And so you have these two parts of God symbolized as man and women, and when they come together, and the image of God is fully displayed, life comes out of it. There was participation in creation, “Be fruitful and multiply,” the first command God gave us was this oneness of the flesh, this intimacy between man and women, that when they came together life happened, creation happened, they were cocreators with God in taking all of this somewhere. God said a man will leave his Father and mother for this reason, to be joined to his wife. He’s talking about men and women, but he’s also talking about Jesus and the Church. Jesus would later leave his Father in heaven so that he would be joined to his bride, the church. But let’s back up to Genesis 1 & 2. There was shalom, the Hebrew word for peace and prosperity. Creation was blessed, holy, and sacred. Dasha, the Hebrew word for produce, or sprout. Creation is dynamic, it’s going somewhere, and these first people were put in the middle of it to rule and subdue creation, to look after it, and guide it along as all of creation obeys the command, “Be fruitful and multiply.” So what you have in Genesis 3 is the disruption of shalom. God intended the world to be a certain way, and we breached his design. In Genesis 3, you have the story of the fall, the snake comes along and deceives Eve into believing that God didn’t have her best interests at heart. There was the forbidden fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the only forbidden thing in the world, and the snake said, “Has God really said you shall not eat? I tell you, God knows if you eat you will be like him.” And it says when she saw that the fruit was desirable, she took from it and ate, and gave to Adam, and their eyes were opened. Yes, just like Satan promised. Enlightenment. But it did not make them like God. The snake deceived them. You see, they were made in God’s likeness. They were already like God. What you have with the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, is there eyes were opened, but they weren’t opened to beauty, and wholeness and serenity. They were opened to shame, and guilt, and condemnation. They saw that they were naked, and they were ashamed, and they hid themselves. Selah. The fruit did not make them like God, it made them like Satan. And so the moment they bit into the apple, what you have is sin entering into the world. Everything was put out of order. There was rebellion against the hierarchy, and death began to reign. God warned them when he forbade them to eat from the tree that if they took from it, death would enter the world in that day. And it did. By eating the fruit, they signed over the deed of the world that God put under their charge, and put it into the hands of sin and death. And it says God’s Spirit yearned jealously for us, and God said, “I am going to send my Son to fight, and he will wrestle with mortality, and he will wrestle against death, and he will triumph over you, because I will raise him up. And I will raise up all of my children the way I raised up him. O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? My Son will face you, and he will beat you, and everyone who receives him, I will give the right to become my children by adoption, the children of God. He has come to take back the keys to the Kingdom that you stole from Adam, and I will restore all things, and I will make all things new, and there will be shalom and beauty again. My kingdom is coming.” And so when God cursed the snake in Genesis 3 for deceiving Eve, he said, “I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring; he shall crush your head, and you shall strike his heel.” Jesus came to fulfil that prophesy. Jesus, God from before the creation of the world, took on flesh, God incarnate, Emanuel, God with us, born from a virgin, the offspring of Eve, came and crushed Satan’s head. You see, when Adam surrendered the deed to the world, all of us became subject to the rule of death and mortality, and Jesus came to take back what Adam lost and offer us eternal life. Sin came into the world by Adam, and there is no sin in holiness, and God is holy, and we can’t be in God’s world with his holiness if we’re tainted with sin, because that would be a paradox. The Bible says that Jesus bore our iniquity on that cross, he paid our debt of sin (the wages of sin is death), and Jesus, who knew no sin, was made to be sin for us, so that in him we might be made the righteousness of God. Jesus has come to rescue us from the reign of death, and all he need to do is receive him. Believe on him for our justification before a holy God. The Bible says Jesus is our great High Priest, he’s our lawyer, defending us before the judge who is both merciful and just in the throne room of grace, and Jesus the devil, our accuser, will not snatch any sheep that is in Jesus’ hands. Will you, right now, receive Jesus as Lord and Savior, our rescue from death and justification before God? Is there any reason to reject Jesus?

Exit rules: historically speaking, what is the statistical chance that my option premium will continue to theta decay to me after it’s 33% P/L closed? If I’m making the assumption that past prices will affect future prices, I’d be wrong. The assumption I’m making is that the same people who were driving markets in the past are still driving the markets today, and psychology changes relatively little. I’m buying on the question of technical, whether I think a stock is overbought or oversold, not on the question of fundamentals, whether I think the company will have a good income statement this year. Nobody can predict that. What you can predict is people’s behavior based on past behavior. And it’s people’s decision making and reaction rules that drives markets. So I have 3 columns in my spreadsheet to record when the most profitable time, P/L %, would have been to exit. (i.e, at what P/L % was my option most valuable, and should I have excited near that P/L % instead of waiting for max profit? This way, if I hold out to the end, I still learn something about my exit rules. I can have a column at the top, “Average max P/L” that changes with every trade, making my exit rule whatever P/L that number is. Statistically speaking, that number is created by overachievers and underachievers, (if there are more underachievers than the number will go down), so if my exit rule is below that, I’m bound to make money as long as it’s a positive number. It would be good to track what price patterns and candlestick patterns preceded any downturns, just so I can break my averages up into categories: exit at these patterns or at this P/L, depending on which antecedent most commonly tends to impact bearish markets. When I simply run to my P/L %, or when the candlesticks are giving me momentum indicators? Ultimately, technical is a game of psychology. How do past behaviors allow me to predict future behaviors? That’s what candlesticks are. They show you behaviors. When things went up, the markets reacted this way. This formula is just to say inretrospect, “This would have been the most profitable time to sell it,” and then look at the conditions surrounding that time of profitability, and say, “Is there some way I can use this to predict when will be the most profitable time to sell in future trades?”

I’m making the assumption that historical prices impact future prices.

I really like Steven Anderson. I memorize and study in the King James Version out of a deep respect for him, but you’ve got to be careful that you don’t overdose listening to him without tempering it with other pastors like John Piper and Jeff Durbin or Francis Chan. He’s very saturated in the Bible, and that is what makes hi spreaching so powerful. But when he uses the term, “Raw preaching,” and in, “It’s not my opinion, it’s just what the Bible clearly teaches,” which I like, he misuses that term, because a lot of what he teaches isn’t raw Bible preaching, leaving it up to you to draw the “obvious” and “clear” consclusions, but he tells you what [he thinks] it means. He doesn’t ever consider that alternative interpretations might challange the first way he understood it. There is a limit to taking interpretive liberty, but there is also a limit to taking interpretive authority. In other words, you can’t just say, “It’s all about interpretations. When Jesus said, ‘Love your neighbor,’ I interpret that to mean, ‘eat your neighbor.’ My interpretation is just as valid as yours, because nobody can claim they know what it truly means.” but you also can’t say, “God said women shouldn’t braid their hair, and that’s that. There’s no question about it. It’s what the Bible says.” Or a better example might be, “The Bible is filled with hard preachers, so we should be hard preachers. It’s okay to dehumanize homosexuals and fill our mouths with unwholesome words calling them sodomite queers, and curse them, making LGBT = Let God Burn Them, and they can’t be saved because of Romans 1.” Like, dude, that’s not a clear teaching at all. And I’ve listened to Anderson, and he jumps around from Jeremiah to Romans making huge inferences to support his agenda. But, “Oh no, it’s not my agenda. It’s raw Bible preaching.” To be fair, I’ve heard him tell his congregation if anything he says is out of step with the Bible, don’t listen to him. So my respect for him isn’t challenged when I think he’s wrong. I’ve notices when I listen to Anderson, it makes elevates my boldness in proclaiming the Bible with authority. I’m not timid with the conclusions I draw from the Bible, saying, “I think it means this, but I understand the arguemtns for why it might mean something else,” essentially saying, “You’re interpretation is valid too.” There are too extremities we want to avoid: one of them is never being bold with the Bible, and one of them is being inconsiderate of people’s challenges what you think it means. Anderson doesn’t really consider that he could be wrong. He approaches challenges with the presupposition that he’s right, and so there’s confirmation bias, and that diables him from looking at the Bible objectively with proper exegesis. He never considers, “Maybe I should actually labor to see if my opponent is correct in this.” No, all of your labor is in disproving them. And that can cause you to have false doctrine. And Anderson does have some false doctrine, because he isn’t a critical thinker in that way. And I respect that too, because he has reasons for it. “Faith comes by hearing, and hearing the word of Chris. Lean not on your own understanding and the understanding of men.” But what he misses is that when you read the Bible, it’s your understanding of what it means. Don’t lean on your understanding. Make provisions to be sure that your understanding of the Bible is actually true. That takes tension, and debate, and consideration, and may the best argument win. John Carl did a sermon about why we need to study the Bible in community. We can get lost if we go unchallenged. And so for that reason, you need to be careful when all you listen to is Steven Anderson, because you’re personality will start to assimilate to the culture of his church, and you’ll approach the Bible in a “divinely authoritative interpreter” sort of way. There are things that are clear, but there’s a lot of passages that are nebulous. And I think Anderson takes his understanding for granted. That everybody who reads the Bible, their understanding of it should just automatically match up and align with his. There should be some conflict. “The Bible says to be all of one mind.” That’s what I love about Anderson. Everything he stands on is based in the Bible.

What does 1 Corinthians 11 mean? In verses 3-8? It means when you worship, don’t cover up Christ. In verse 3 right before he says, “Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head,” he defines what “head” means: “the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man.” So let’s replace the pronouns with the noun: Every man praying or prophesying, having Christ covered, dishonoureth Christ. But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her husband uncovered dishonoureth her husband: for that is even all one as if she were shaven [single, or a harlot. Her husband naked in public].  The Bible is saying, “When you worship, do it to give glory to God, not to be glorious.” So many worship leaders don’t understand this. They want to be the object of praise when they’re “giving” praise to God. They want to perform before their audience of church members and get glory from performing well. They want to be recognized. The Bible says, “No, no, no. When you worship, you keep Christ as the object of attention, not you. You keep man’s head uncovered, and women’s head covered. Don’t make your prayers about you, wanting to impress people with how spiritual you are. Wanting to get praise for how “godly” you are in praising God.” That’s what 1 Corinthians 11 is all about.

In the morning I study my Bible on Olive Tree. I go as slow as I need to, pray through passages, leave no stone unturned, write down all of my thoughts. That pace will not get you through he Bible in one year. But right before bed, from 10:00 to 10:30, I read my Geneva Bible with my Jasmine plus bookstand and set my wakeup light to dim at 10:15 so that I have enough light to finish by 10:30, and a slow enough digression of light that it makes me sleepy. Plus reading just makes me sleepy. At night is when I try and get through the Bible in a year. I’m a very slow reader, which keeps me on my toes in my night reading. I read about 100 words per minute, and at that pace it’ll take me half an hour every day to get through the Bible in a year. I just go Genesis to Revelation, because I’m doing it on a pace basis, not a checklist basis. And it’s not like I don’t ever right epiphanic moments down, but I don’t intentionally slow myself down to try and see something in the Bible. That’s what I do in the morning. What I do at night is just saturate myself in as much Bible as I can. The Bible is our daily bread, not our daily chewing gum. Morning is for exhaustive reading, and night is for exhausting reading. So I read meticulously in the morning with Olive Tree, and that wakes me up, and I read quickly at night with a physical Bible, and that makes me sleepy. But today, we have people that just want to watch TV before they go to bed, and you’ve got this blue light right in your face, messing with your circadian rhythms. And then they wonder why they’re not sleeping well. And then they go to doctors to figure out why they have insomnia. Here’s Ethan’s quick trick to curing insomnia: work very hard throughout the day and don’t put plasma screens in front of your face before bed time. The Bible says God grants sleep to the ones he loves. If you want to sleep well, work hard. God said to Cain, “If thou doest well shalt though not be accepted?” Accepted by who? Accepted by God. He gives sleep to the ones he loves. If you want sweet sleep, do well. Work hard. And God will grant you sleep.

Keep my mind from dwelling on vanity; and quicken thou me in thy way.

I looked up “tree” on google one time when I was designing a logo, and down the line was a picture of a tree with a naked women on it. And my eyes snapped to it, and I was like, “Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity and quicken thou me in thy way.” Look, things will happen. You will drive by billboards. You will see advertisements. David will see women bathing, evidently, as he stands on his roof overlooking his kingdom. But he says, “No, turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity.” “Look, I’m the king. I have access to watch naked women whenever I want—but no, it’s not your way, Lord. Quicken thou me in thy way. Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity.” That’s from Psalms. But if we confess out sin he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. He will cleanse us. He will.

In Ephesians 1, Paul makes an implied parallel between the promised land that the Israelites inherited, and the promised Holy Spirit that Christians inherit when they believe on the Lord Jesus. 5 chapters later he says, "Obey your parents in the Lord, which is the first commandment with a promise, that it may go well with you, and you may live long in the land of promise." If you want to live long with the promised Holy Spirit, obey your parents.

And strength. Right? “Can I trust him to stay and protect the family? Or is he going to ditch us at the first sign of trouble and leave us defenseless.” And so when you see men playing with children, your subconscious goes, “Aha, this person can be trusted to stick around and fight for us.” Why? Because you fight for what you care about. When you play with little children, that shows that you care about them. And if you care, you’ll fight. And so in today’s day and age, that evolutionary instinct is really obsolete because you frankly don’t need a man to stick around and protect you from dangerous threats. Animals and barbarians and such. We have police. We have guns, which are great equalizers. So marriage is a sham today, quite frankly. It’s not needed. You are attracted to him for reasons that are irrelevant to the way our society functions. At least that’s what the biologists say, and I think there’s something to it. There’s enough people in the world; humanity doesn’t need you to keep it alive. So just be celibate forever, and don’t let your biology trick you into getting married by urging you with primitive instincts that are meant for the survival of our species.

If I talk something up: “Oh it’s so good! It’s the best treat ever!” Where is the line between the hearer psychologically believing it tastes better then he otherwise would have, and it just raising his expectations so that it taste worse than it otherwise would have? That is, what are the best ways to condition children’s taste for things, so that they enjoyw healthy food more and junk food less?

You Forgot! Haha! Look, if you’re not going to make provisions to remember something as simple as a date, I can’t trust you to remember your covenant with me when another man seduces you to sleep with him. “That’s not fair.” That’s exactly what’s fair. I wish you well, but not with me. “You’re never going to get a wife with those ridicules standards.” Yeah, I’ve figured that out already. That’s why when you asked, “Are you single,” at the beginning of it, I said, “Perpetually.”

Faith, I don’t want you to watch this YouTube channel. It’s setting up a framework in your mind about how people behave and make decisions about how they look. That woman has short hair, and she wears it as a glory to her when God says it’s a shame unto her. That’s like what Paul’s talking about when he talks about people whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things. I don’t want you watching these feminist channels allowing women to behave in ways that God says, “No.” You’re not to be this loud, controlling force, glorying in your short hair which is equivalent to nakedness in 1 Corinthians 11. She’s naked on screen on purpose, and your watching her rate toys. That’s not okay. Turn it off. It’s teaching you that it’s okay to have short hair. Turn it off.

It’s not about your numbers, it’s about, “Do you trust the promises of God?” And the minute you start to say, “Do I really have the numbers that are necessary to win a war?” You’re not trusting God’s promises, you’re trusting your numbers. That was the point with David’s census. It’s, “Hey, I’ve given you my promises, I’ve been faithful, and it’s still in your heart that you need to work and win by your own strength. But you can’t win by your own strength, and I’m going to show you that again by dwindling your numbers that are so precious to you.” And David goes, “No God, I believe you. It was my fault. You don’t need to kill off the great numbers of Israel for me to know that it’s not our strength, but the God who goes with us. You don’t need to make Israel small so that when you deliver us we’ll know it was you. I know that right now, I just glitched for a moment. Punish me, but leave Israel alone. They shouldn’t all die so that you can prove to me what you’ve already shown time and time again. Forgive me.” And God hears that prayer and turns to the angel of death and says, “It is enough! David knows. His heart is in the right place again.”

According to Miller’s Theorum, you will consume about this much value in your life, and you’ll be liable to produce 75% of what you consume, 25% of what each of your children consume (excluding non-per-capita values), and 75% of what your wife will consume. This assumes a very good life, and only calculates what you’re liable for, assuming that you’re only liable for your family. However, because there are people in the world that do not produce what they are liable for (either due to death, disability, or laziness), there are dependents (orphans and widows and the family of lazy men) who need to be taken care of, and so the community as a whole is inclined (voluntarily liable—not forced with a gun like communism) to produce 25%-X% (where X is the amount of value they already have access to) of the lifetime consumption needs of orphans, 75%-X% of the lifetime consumption needs of widows, 0% of the lifetime consumption needs of lazy people, and 100% of the advancement (innovative) needs of the underprivileged (people whose labor hours are of primitively low value, and therefore they work (not lazy), but they don’t have enough). If we calculate the number of orphans and widows in the world, we will have the % consumption value that the community as a whole is inclined to produce, and if we divide it by the number of workers in the community, we’ll have the % production value each working man is inclined to produce for orphans and widows. The comes the more complicated part: calculating for the advancement needs of underprivileged working men. First we need to determine what their labor hours are worth, and how much they can be advanced in the specific field of work he does (the amount that it is able to increase is the “advancement stretch”)

How do we determine how much each person gives? By the amount of excess they produce against the amount of excess the average working man produces. Whatever percentage that is, is the real amount (the practical assignment opposed to the ideal per capita number) you should be inclined to give. If you don’t make enough excess to provide the per capita number you’re inclined to (therefore contributing to the “real vs ideal” verience), you should be inclined to work more labor hours or advance your labor hours to meet that value of excess you are inclined to produce as a working man.

Calculating for lazy people is easy, because %0 of their consumption needs is 0. (Note that family of actually disabled men are classified as orphans and widows, and a man deprived of his body is equivalent to a widow, having lost the provider, making us inclined for 75% of his consumption needs.) It is very interesting that the Bible never tells us to care for the family of lazy men (essentially orphaned and widowed). Maybe the poverty of their family will get him off his lazy butt. His own hunger should, according to Paul. You say, “He just can’t get a job.” If he’s hungry enough, he’ll find a job. He’ll produce value some way. People who make looking for a job their job find a job.

Some professions produce zero value, but rather serve as equalizers in distribution (I’m thinking about options traders). All that does is transfer money from one party to another party. It doesn’t actually produce anything valueable in the world. This is where value distortion is at play. By and large we can say, “Market prices are accurate in how much value you produce against how much you get paid,” but there are obvious exceptions to that, and subtle exceptions to that, both of which should be accounted for in a later project. Is making AE videos really worth anything as far as the consumption needs of people go?

It’s going to be difficult to distinguish between underprivileged people and people who should be inclined to ancreasae their labor hours of the advancement value thereof. People who work 8 hours a day are either producing as much as they are consuming, or producing less than they’re consuming. How do you determine if they are just slack in their work, or if they don’t have the resources necessary to advance their labor hours? That’s one consideration. A second consideration is value distortion. Should a McDonalds worker be paid as much as the CEO? They are producing different amounts, but the CEO is getting paid for an idea, and the worker is getting paid for production and the advancement value that idea contributed to it. But the McDonalds worker shouldn’t get paid more than the value he’s producing. If it isn’t enough, he’s not underprivileged, he’s lazy and needs to advance his labor hour production value. That is, if what he’s consuming is more than what he’s producing, he needs to produce more. But how can you tell the difference between a lack of ambition and drive and a lack of potential (i.e. lack of resources to advance value of labor hour)? How can you distinguish between slack work and primitive methods? That’s a second consideration. A third consideration is family. A man who is liable for the consumption needs of a family of 8 needs to produce enough value to sustain that, and he won’t do it at McDonalds. He needs to advance his labout hour value either by education or by other resources, and he will be considered “underprivileged” until his labor hours are valuable enough to sustain his family. This is why we don’t pay for his consumption needs, but for his advancement value needs. But how will he consume in the mean time? That’s a third consideration.

And listen, we can provide education for free or very cheaply with programs like Khan Academy and Education Portal. Advancement value shouldn’t cost the time and money that we’re spending on it with our schools. We don’t need that many people to reiterate what a video can explain better. You say, “People need personalized explanations.” There’s a world of information. Let it be online. We’ll have tutors. We’ll have message boards. We’ll have forums. We don’t need kids to sit in a class room 8 hours a day. “It’s for social needs.” Let’s split up social needs from learning needs. “But that’s not the way it is in the real world.” They’re not in the real world. They will do fine without us desensitizing them to the “real world” before they ever get there. It’s the principle of satiation. Let’s stop doing. Education shouldn’t cost all that.

And you know what? Everybody should go through financial peace university. And that’s a video series. It just needs coordinators. We should stop having teachers and start having coordinators. Then introverts will have access to the materials if they didn’t understand something, and extroverts will have access to the coordinators if they didn’t understand something. Let’s hire the best explainers and get them to teach on videos that the kids can enjoy for free. Let’s pay off Dave Ramsey to offer his program for free to everyone so that we’ll have a better world. I think he’ll do it to; he can retire any time he wants. He’s in this to help people.

The advantage of having narrower spreads is more option premium. The closer ITM it is, the more premium you collect. I prefer to keep probabilities a little higher and collect lower premiums. This is also because I have very limited buying power and need to keep my capital requirements low.

Here’s the problem I have with Deborah’s fear: If she can’t enjoy being safely afraid, I think she will spurn God. God is a million more terrifying than a scary movie. And it’s that same principle of: you’re safe when you’re scared. But if you hate being scared even when you’re safe, then you will hate being in the presence of God, and that’s not okay.

The only way theta works is by giving you premium. Don’t separate the Greeks from the price of your option. That’s all they are. They are indicators of how your premium is going to change throughout the life of your option.

“You can’t expect to pick on people and not have them fight back.” I disagree. Words can be ignored. I used to get picked on by my older brothers all the time, and if they offended me with words, I defended myself [pause for emphasis] with words. If somebody says something rude to you, it should cause you to evaluate it, see if it’s true, and if it’s true, change, and if his reasoning in convoluted, argue with him. I am very pro argument. It’s how we test and refine ideas. I don’t think people should be punched in the mouth for having bad ideas. They should be argued with.

“You can’t expect to pick on people and not have them fight back.” I disagree. Jesus said overcome good with evil. Really. When you punch somebody in the mouth because they were mean to you, that’s not healthy for the world. But when you continue to treat them well when they’re mean to you, you might actually be helping them to become a better person in society. The way you fight people being mean to you is not with physical violence,

Inevitably, law is built on the foundation of psychology. (Ultimately, law is a question of psychology.) We should be asking the question, “Is justice is corrective, not punitive?” Enabling people to punch someone in the mouth is punitive. “Well, you had it coming.” But that’s not how we make society better. That’s how we start personal wars. The way you make society better is by being compassionate, and saying, “I’m going to treat him better than he’s treating me.” If somebody is inviting violence, literally provoking you, or threatening somebody you care about, that’s one thing. But if they’re just saying nonsense, “Oh, look, there’s Ethan. The small little runt. I don’t like you.” Get over it. If you need to defend yourself, fight fire with fire. Use words, not violence.

 If somebody is being mean to you when you don’t deserve it,

“Are you aware that not everybody believes in God?” Yes ma’am; that’s why the world’s hostile.

I don’t have the kind of face that turns women on. That’s in the “advantages of dating me” list. I’m too ugly to cheat on you.

“Allah does not change the condition of people until they change the condition of themselves. The reason why most of these things are happening in the Muslim world is because the Muslim’s themselves have not internalized Islam. That’s the problem. They don’t embody it.

Global warming shouldn’t be this complicated. Natural processed emit 780 GT of C02 every year, compared with 30 GT released by man-made processes. The thing is, nature also absorbs those 780 GT it’s responsible for, but we don’t absorb the 30 GT we’re responsible for. The solution to global warming isn’t by cutting down our emission levels, it’s by finding a way to absorb them.

There is a reason “jock” shares common letters with “jerk.”

Unhappy people sleep in late. Right? Because it hurts to wake up. You wake up and your heart just whines. The alarm goes off and you feel like crying. I actually get excited about waking up each night before I go to bed, because I love life. The reason people don’t want to wake up is because they enjoy sleep more than they enjoy life. It has nothing to do with, “I’m just so tired.” It has everything to do with joy.

In Sunday School I had this Epiphany: sin can be thought of as not trusting the promises of God (see 2 Apr 2017 Journal entry). Today, only 4 days later, I read this: whatsoever is not of faith is sin. I realized this truth by looking at the examples in the Bible of those who trusted God and were victorious, and those that trusted themselves and were defeated. David’s census was sin. He was doubting God’s promises. If God says, “I will give you everywhere your foot touches,” you should be running. If you’re not, that shows that you don’t really believe him, and therefore it’s sin. If you commit fornication, it’s because you don’t trust him. You don’t trust that his ways are higher than our ways, and that his law is perfect. Sin is when you don’t trust God. And that’s what Paul is saying here in Romans 14:23

Have a precomp with different verse layers right on top of each other (with different blurred verses alternating), then another precomp with that composition moving as needed (trackmatted to a parchment layer), and that comp inside the main comp.

When I was drafting a sample of a formal complaint by Satan, I was put down for the name of the defendant, “Child of God,” and I was just imagining some lawyer saying, “That’s an obvious conflict of interest. God shouldn’t be the judge decided a case against his own child.” In America, that’s true. But it’s true because we assume the judge won’t make a just judgement, which is an assumption we can’t impose on God because he’s perfectly just. This made me realize why God is just. If somebody committed a tort, and the judge let him go because he’s the judge’s son, we’d say that judge was dirty. Right? We’d probably try and disbar that judge or at least appeal the judgement, because it was corrupt. But if the judge who was the boy’s father didn’t declare him innocent when he was obviously guilty, but personally paid for the boy’s crime, that’s a righteous judge. That’s the reason for the cross. It was God’s justice. He didn’t just declare us innocent when we were guilty; he paid for the guilt he declared us to be.

“For decades, the debate has raged over whether you should leave your computer on every single second or give it regular rest. Both sides believe their way is better for a computer's life. The shut-it-down crowd believes that leaving it on and working will wear out components faster and shorten your computer's life. The leave-it-on crew believes that repeated shutdowns and startups will wear out components faster and shorten your computer's life. In other words, _they're worried about the same thing for completely opposite reasons_.” This is a parable of polatics. We all want the same things, we just disagree about how to get it. That’s why Ii’m constantly saying polatics is ultimately a question of psychology. It’s a slew of opposing models about what will best motivate people to work, give, produce, distribute, and basically function as a generally good person in society. How should we take care of people that can’t take care of themselves? How should we build roads? How should we regulate what people can and can’t do? What policies should exist? It all comes back to human behavior and human decision making, and the disagreements are not about the result, but about how we get to the result. It’s about what will work and what won’t work. Globally speaking, though, the biggest thing that works is unity. It isn’t whether you have capitalism or communism (China shows communism works (Rob Cast, special guest, after election), old America shows capitalism works). What works is when there isn’t this divide between half the nation simultaneously trying out two different models. Each half is undoing the work of the other half, and we’re spending all of this work and effort arguing about who’s model is best for America. In my opion, if you want communism, go to a communist country. We have them. America is the capitalist nation of the world.

Sidestepping the Banana Skins:

I have this raging fear of intimacy. I remember when I was younger and we would watch a movie with a kissing scene, I would just think, “How do you talk to her after you’ve kissed her? The next time you see her there’s going to be this huge elephant in the room, and… awkward.” Strangely enough, it’s only awkward in the hypothetical. But it wasn’t that I didn’t have the urge to kiss anyone, it was that I had a fear of it in conjunction with my urge to do it, and my fear was more powerful than the urge.

## Points of Disagreement

For a long time, my cousin Paul and I have had a point of disagreement about trusting in God and how it interacts with how we prepare for situations in day to day life. Whether it’s guns, money, wellness, it all revolves around this central question: “Should we do everything we can before trusting God to do what we can’t, or should we trust God and then spend our efforts in light of the believing that he will come through on his promises? Paul’s doctrine frames the first question, and my doctrine frames the last. Here’s how the argument goes: if I “just trust God,” a phrase Paul mocks me for (but that’s okay—judge in right step with your conscience), then I will become lazy and demand that God provide for me while I sit around and do nothing. That’s a fair concern. Here’s my concern: If I

I’ve lived the first quarter of my life, and I’ve never been inclined to so much as punch a person in the face. (And Paul says, “Well you live in America.” Yes, and I will continue to live in America, so I don’t need a gun. And don’t pretend that you’ve ever encountered a situation that you’ve needed to shoot someone. “But I know someone…” Stop it. You can’t make a rule from the anecdote. That’s all pathos and no logos.) Based on simple probabilities (and overwhelming statistical probabilities), you will never encounter a situation where you will need your gun to defend yourself or someone you care about from death. That, to me, is just being overly cautious, wasting your money and wasting your time. Paranoia is nobody’s best color. For clarity’s sake, I believe guns are an excrescence of fear and distrust in people. That’s not a bad thing from a micro level (fear is what prompts us to protect ourselves—it keeps us alive), but when you zoom out I think you start to see the consequences of it. Fear and distrust has caused more violence and death than raw hatred ever has. “Shoot first, ask questions later.” “Castle rights.” When you have a gun, and you are in a place of being threatened, your first impulse is going to be to fight. Given that as a general rule, people have the obligation to flee if they can, or it isn’t considered self-defense in the court room. But if you have a gun, you will spend a lot less effort hiding, running, or reasoning, and my thesis is that more people die from you shooting them out of fear than people do from being shot by the people you feared.

Moving on. Guns are instruments of security that enable us to trust ourselves instead of God. Just like money. The more secure you feel, the less you “need” God, and the less you rely on him. I think that shows in the way that we pray. There is a hierarchy of prayer that depends on how much we trust ourselves in portportion to how much we trust God. The best place to be is total insecurity in self and total security in God. That’s my premise. And its what Paul disagrees with. “It’s good to know you can handle yourself,” is the phrase I mock Paul for. You see, Paul says that when I “just trust God,” I’m making an excuse to be lazy. But that’s making the assumption that it’s easier to trust God than to trust yourself, and that’s our point of disagreement. (Most of our diagreements are actually found in one of the premises of an argument, not the conclusion.) In my experience, observation, and most importantly Bible study, I believe and maintain that it’s easier to trust yourself then to trust God. Gideon has 300 men going to war against upwards 100,000 Midianites. Is it easy to trust that God will deliver you? Or Asa, when he was battling with the King of Israel, hired an army to go to war with him. Sounds good, right? “Do everything you can and let God do the rest.” But God chastised him for it, saying, “Why are you trying to do it yourself? Trust me to do it! Haven’t I shown you that it’s it’s vanity to prepare your horses for battle (Psalm 33:16-19)? But you just want to make the excuse that you’re, ‘Doing everything you can and trusting God to do the rest.’ That’s not trust at all, because you aren’t living any differently then you would if you didn’t trust me at all.” So while make accuses me of making the excuse to be lazy, I accuse Paul of making the excuse to keep his security in himself. That’s the problem I have with people who pray for the doctor’s hands as well. It’s a safe prayer. They aren’t really trusting God to do anything, they’re just putting a Christian twist on their trust in the doctor. Just like Asa, who in the last part of his life, it says he went to the physicians instead of God to cure his diseased foot. So it is not easy to “just trust God.” That’s about the hardest thing you can do, and it’s not an excuse for laziness, and you can see that by my life lived, laboring in travail night and day, following the example of Paul. But that’s an anecdote, and like I’ve already pointed out, you can’t derive a rule from an anecdote, so I’ll leave that out of my argument. My point is that it’s easier to trust yourself then to trust God. Jesus said, “My yoke is easy, and my burden is light,” but you just can’t believe that, can you Paul? Because it’s hard to trust God. It’s hard to believe that it’s easy. Jesus said, “The gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life.” The gate is Jesus, only 1 way, and it’s hard to believe what he said 4 chapters later: that it’s easy. It’s hard to actually live differently then you otherwise would because you believe the promise: “seek first the kingdom of God and all these things will be added unto you.” You see, my trust in God is not that I trust God will just take care of me. It’s trust that if I work for his kingdom, I won’t need to work for the world. If I keep my religion pure and undefiled, caring for orphans and widows, I won’t need a retirement account, because God will take care of me. It’s not an excuse not to work, it’s a shifting of effort from the things of man to the things of God. When I say I “just trust God,” I do not mean I don’t work. I mean I don’t waste my work building bigger barns and getting security, but I work for the kingdom of God, and I live my life in such a way that shows my security is in God, not in my retirement account. “That ye may have something to give to one who has need,” and there are people dying from starvation, we would literally need to close our eyes to be oblivious to it, but we would rather make our future “secure” by trusting in ourselves instead of God than do what God said and care for the orphan and the widow and feed the poor. (This is extremely poorly written. I will need to simplify my arguments better to obey Fayman’s Law.) Essentially it comes down to this: should we be presumptuous that God will fulfil our base needs, freeing up our time to work for the kingdom instead of our base needs? Or should we spend our work addressing our base needs (food, clothes, shelter, retirement, etc), and then work for God in our spare time? – When Jesus said, “Seek first the Kingdom of God and all these things will be added unto you,” it is preceded by this passage, and it’s too good not to read:

25 Therefore I say unto you, **Take no thought for your life**, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?

26 Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?

27 Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?

28 And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:

29 And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.

30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?

31 Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?

32 (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.

33 But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.

34 Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.

So there are points of disagreement in the church, even among friends, but that doesn’t mean we can’t be of one mind. We agree on the cardinal doctrines, and everything else is secondary. And when things that relate to this long, drawn out argument come up in conversations, I don’t contend with him, because we’ve both already had the opportunity to present our case, so further argumentation would be fruitless. I just go with it. It saves time, and it saves friendship. There’s no point in argumentation that isn’t edifying, giving grace to them that hear.

## Points of Disagreement End

“E. M. Miller here with Prager University; [blank pause]; gotchya!” “So I’m not really from Prager University, but their videos are awesome, so click here to check them out. You’re like, ‘Why are you putting advertisements in your videos that you’re not getting paid for?’ Cause their videos are awesome. You see, I think advertisement should be free. If your stuff is good, people are going to share it, and if it’s not, you’re going to be ignored. Stop forcing advertisements on people that’s based on something completely disconnected from, ‘Wow, that was really cool! I want to be the first person to share it on my friends list!’”

Sometimes somebody’s argument has so many infringements on the rules of logic that it can be hard to follow. This is an example of that. You say, “He felt compelled to serve that black community! That shows how racist he is.” You’re assuming at least 3 unspoken premises that are necessary for that conclusion to logically follow by the rules of induction. The burden isn’t on me yet, you still have to show that there is some link between caring enough about black people to choose to serve them and racism. And then you go on to say, “We went to that place in Chicago, and he wasn’t there!” inferring inconsistency in Anderson’s story. The level of stupidity it takes to not understand that the constraints of time preclude a past event from occurring indefinitely is overwhelming, and it’s astonishing to me that you’ve achieved it. I frequently encounter people who are mentally challenged, but this is boarder-lining what the Bible calls being “willingly ignorant,” or stupid on purpose. Nobody naturally makes arguments as dumb as yours; it makes me wonder how you’ve arrived at this debased mind of yours. 90% of what you say is saturated in logical violations, and there’s no way you’re oblivious to that. I don’t believe people as verbally coherent as you are as logically disjointed as you come across.

The amazing things about Russel’s class is that he didn’t just fill us with head knowledge, he challenged us and inspired us to learn on our own, and walk out what we were learning. That’s what made his class the most foundational two years of my life.

## Evolution and atheism

When I talk about evolution, I don’t mean speciation (the changing of specious), but the preservation of specious. You can call it adaptation if you like. If you look at the human genome, certain regions of your DNA can be active or inactive depending on outside factors like weather, or whether you’re being active or not, or whether you’re drinking a lot of water or not. So these regions of DNA, these genes that tell your cells how to be constructed and how to behave can be turned on and off. So if you’re drinking a lot of water, your body retains less of it, because it can count on you having a plentiful supply. If you drink less water, it stores more up in your body, preparing you to go longer without it. That’s actually a genetic thing. It’s what we call epigenetics. So when wolves move to colder climates, certain genes become active that were formerly inactive that tell the cells to build thicker coats. It’s not new genetic information, a Darwinian sort of evolution, as Richard Dawkins would mislead you to believe, but it’s an epigenetic sort of evolution. Your genes adapt to the conditions of the environment you live in. And that’s something we see within a single generation’s lifespan, which is how we know it has nothing to do with offspring inheriting genes that were foreign to the parents. It’s all about the activity of the genes you already have.

In order to make a case for Darwinian evolution (which in my opinion is the equivalent to spontaneous generation applied on a genetic level—genes don’t just spontaneously appear out of nowhere by this mysterious force called natural selection) you would need to sequence the entire DNA strand of both parents (including inactive genes), sequence the entire DNA strand of the offspring (including inactive genes) and show that there is a TCGA sequence that is foreign to both parents. Nobody has done that. And if you did find an anomaly where the offspring inherited a gene that was foreign to both parents, you’d need to figure out where it came from. You can’t just say, “The weather gave him new genes.” The weather doesn’t have a sperm. The obvious truth is that anomalies in translation (called mutations) are a result of translation gone wrong, not the result of some magical fairy godmother called natural selection that says, “I will bless you with new genes.” That’s the most stupid thing taken seriously in science today that nobody provides a shred of evidence for, and it’s astonishing to me how many people believe it. “It takes a college graduate to believe something that foolish.” Genes come from this process called “conception,” and you need to figure out how that works before you can attribute foreign genes to something stupid like the environment. The environment doesn’t have any genes to give you! All the environment does it activate some of the existing genes you have and make some of them inactive. That’s it. And that actually makes sense. How in the world the environment could spontaneously generate a new gene in the egg that if formed at conception has yet to be explained by anyone.

I used to really respect Richard Dawkins, because I thought, “Well he’s just fallowing the evidence.” But then when I looked at his evidence, I thought, “There’s no way somebody could be so stupid as to believe this has an ounce of weight to it.” And so he’s either really dumb, or he’s being intellectually dishonest, and I don’t think somebody who is as verbally coherent as him can be as intellectually vapid as his arguments are, so I think he’s being intellectually dishonest because he hates God. He doesn’t want to answer to God, and so he hates God, and if he hates God he hates me too. What you have with him is huge levels of confirmation bias, appeals to inappropriate authority, infringements in the basic rules of logic, he’s not covering all of his basis, he lacks positive and negative control groups, and if you diagram his arguments you’ll see this. And yet people take him seriously. Why? Because people who hate God are looking for a way to escape what has been clearly perceived since the creation of the world, that creation has a creator. And so someone like Richard Dawkins who is smart enough to make stupid ideas sound plausible is appealing to them. But in the end, they are still stupid ideas, and I think people are going to realize that very soon. As research pins down what precisely goes on at conception, there’s going to be less space for people like Dawkins to make these giant leaps and nonsensical inferences. That’s already happening with epigenetics, and it’s only an amount of time before people start uncovering what’s really going on and start to become educated instead of indoctrinated by this atheist agenda in our school books today.

And I would love to have a conversation with Richard Dawkins, because I still have a lingering respect for him. But I don’t think he would talk to me, because he isn’t interested in having arguments and debate with people who don’t take his crap seriously and actually have the intelligence to pin down his arguments and back them up against a wall, so you’ll see him refuse to debate people like William Lane Craig in the name of, “He’s being intellectually dishonest.” I mean, if that’s the case, you should be rushing over there to expose his arguments, because there’s a lot of people listening to him that need to know the truth. But he’s just afraid to lose, because he knows Craig will destroy him. And he knows people are drawing these inferences, so he felt compelled to write an article making an excuse for why he won’t debate Craig, and it’s just as full of crap as he is. You can access it online and see what you think. Is he being honest? I don’t think so. He’s just afraid to debate Craig, the coward that he is. And I will make him this promise: if he talks to me, I will come with an open mind. The truth is all that matters, right? I don’t want to waste my life living for God if he doesn’t even exist. But the truth is there is a God, and he sent his Son Jesus into the world out of love for you, Mr. Dawkins, so that you can have the remission of sins and obtain eternal life. I don’t know why in the world you would hate this God who so loved you that he took one flesh to pay the price for your sin, but as long as you hate him, we’re enemies. And as long as you hate God, you will never look at the evidence without exhausting every possible way to make it fit into your worldview. Science is about finding truth, not finding escapes, and that’s why I am comfortable calling you my enemy. Jesus said to love your enemies, that ye may be sons of your father. But Jehoshaphat was actually cursed for making friends with them that hate God, and the Bible says friendship with the world is enmity with God. So until you can come to your senses and realize that you have no reason to hate God, I frankly think listening to you is a waste of time. So if you can come with an open mind, I will match that. And I don’t take that promise lightly. But ultimately knowing the truth is all that matters in this debate. And no kind of bias is ever helpful in that pursuit.

Now, let me be candid about one thing. In 1 Peter 3:15, when it says to always be ready to give a reason for the hope that is in you, the mantra of apologists, a few verses earlier it says to sanctify the Jesus as Lord in your heart. That’s where I need to begin. I will sanctify him as Lord in my heart. If we’re going to talk about presuppositions, I need to be forthright about this one. I am looking at the evidence beginning with the presupposition that Jesus is Lord. You say, “That’s bad science.” But I’m more concerned with pleasing God and satisfying his standards rather than satisfying the standards of men. It sounds like circular reasoning, I admit. But ultimately, let me tell you something, ultimately faith comes by hearing, and by hearing the words of Christ. My faith is not wound up in the evidence for God’s existence, it’s would up in the self-authenticating word of God, which is the highest authority in my life. Let me be honest about that. If anything is going to deter Dawkins from talking to me, it’s going to be that. But let me just say this: if you talk to me, even if you’re not doing it to persuade me personally, there will be people who hear both of our arguments, and they will either be persuaded by your arguments, or my arguments. So please don’t think it’s just a waste of time to talk to me because the Bible is my ultimate authority. I am going to be using arguments from general revelation, not special revelation. But as I approach the evidence of general revelation, I’m going to be starting with the presupposition that Jesus is Lord, which I arrived at through the Bible. And you need to know that. I openly admit confirmation bias, and I’m not ashamed of it, because God tells us to start by sanctifying Jesus as Lord in our hearts. That’s all I wanted to say. I don’t think anyone becomes a Christian without the hearing the Bible and being convicted that it’s true. Because the Bible says faith comes through hearing, and hearing the words of Christ. John Piper said one time that ultimately, the way the Bible is written is the reason he believes it. Whoever wrote it has earned his trust by the transcendent way that it is written. That’s what I mean by self-authenticating. You read it and go, “Wow, this is nothing like anything man has ever written. It isn’t like these other frauds. There’s something pure and holy and transcendent about this book that has won my trust.” That’s the way Paul said faith happens, and apart from that, no one will believe on Jesus.

You say, well that’s a double standard. But that’s his standard, not my standard. If God does not exist, which is the worldview wherewith he looks at the evidence, then confirmation bias absolutely is terrible, and so he should be bound by it by his own worldview. But if you start with the worldview that Jesus is Lord, and you look at the evidence through that lens, then confirmation bias isn’t a sin, because our ultimate source of truth isn’t leaning on mean’s understanding, but on what God says. I know this is hard to keep up with. But it’s really not a double-standard. I don’t believe it is necessary to eliminate confirmation bias to arrive at truth BECAUSE we can assume certain foundational truths that are in the Bible. But if God doesn’t exist, and that’s the lens by which you look at the evidence, you can’t make any assumption at all. Do you see how this works? If you start with, “Jesus is Lord,” than you can begin with that central assumption and build all of your science on top of it. Other confirmation bias’s are still infringements in the rules of logic, but if the if you begin with the assumption that the Bible is true, then every truth God tells us in the Bible is an authentic assumption. So I’m actually not violating the standard I’m imposing on Dawkins. Every assumption you make that’s not in the Bible is a logical fallacy. If you begin with the assumption that we can’t assume the Bible is true, then you have no valid assumptions to base your science on. If the Bible isn’t true, you can’t make assumptions and say that’s good science. And because Dawkins starts with the assumption that the Bible isn’t true, he is bound with the obligation to make zero assumptions and follow the rules of logic to arrive at truth as closely as we can I know this seems like philosophical acrobatics, but if you take some time to sort out the logic of it, it actually does make sense. If your worldview is that the Bible is true, you can look at the evidence in light of everything the Bible says is true. If your worldview is that not everything in the Bible is true, you are obligated to be as objective as you can, leaving no stone unturned, because confirmation bias gets in the way of objectively analyzing data, which is the best way we can unravel truth.

And I have the sense to know that people are going to use this kind of logic: “if you can begin with the assumption that the Bible is true, then Dawkins can start with the assumption that the book of the flying spaghetti monster is true! And that’s just as valid. Your argument is nonsense, Ethan.” And you’d be right. Dawkins has the freedom to start with those basic assumptions, but he also has the obligation to admit that he’s starting with them. And it’s missing the point of what I’m saying. What I’m saying is a defense of the accusation of hypocrisy. Everyone is bound by the rules of their worldview. Since Dawkins’ worldview is that there are no authorities (no assumptions that we can trust without providing support for) he is obligated to conform his reasoning with that worldview. Since my worldview is that the Bible is true, I’m obligated to look at the evidence in light of what the Bible says is true, and any assumptions I make outside of that follows the same standard that Dawkins is obliged to satisfy. In my worldview, Dawkins can’t make assumptions except those that are in the Bible. In Dawkins worldview, he can’t make any assumptions at all. So I’m violating his standard, but he’s also violating his standard. While he’s still violating my standard, I’m not violating my standard. So I don’t have doublestandars, but he does. Unless his standards are that the book of the flying spe menster is true. In which case he needs to be forthright about where he’s deriving his foundational assumptions, lest he violate his own standard.

## Education: A Parent’s Responsibility

Education needs to shift from the teachers to parents. Why? Because education begins in the student’s mind. It begins with the student being motivated and anspired to learn and make good decisions, and that’s the job of parents. It isn’t a teachers job to parent children, it’s a teachers job to provide students with the resources necessary to achieve what their parents have inspired them to do. That’s why I say that the quality of education can’t be separated from the pulpit. The preachers of America to to instill to parents what they are responsible for. With every turkey knife, you can use it to chop a turkey, or you can flip it around and kill someone. With every advancement in education, every gift and freedom that enables them to go further (I’m thinking of YouTube), there is the potential to abude it, and the solution isn’t to physically restrain people from misusing it, I don’t think that’s possible. We will never get to the point where we can physically restrain people from using a turnkey knife to stab someone with. The solution is in dealing with the root cause, in parenting them and inspiring them so that they make good decisions in life. That’s where the solution has to be, and it’s all on the parents, not the teachers, and we as America need to understand that, and the rpeachers of America need to usher a new age where parents are responsible for parenting again. Stop shifting the blame on the teachers to do what’s impossible to do. They are not responsible for phsycially restraining your kids from making bad decisions. Youa re responsible for inspiring and motivating your kids to make good decisions. It’s all on you, parents. It’s time we understand this.

Education starts in the student’s mind, with the student’s decision to make good choices in life, and it’s the parent’s job to instill those values in their kids, not the teacher’s. I am conviced that the majority of problems with our education system today is not with our system, it’s not with our teachers, it’s a problem of parents being to lazy to parent their children. That’s the problem with education today. What we have is kids that are growing up without guidance, without being told what they should value and how they should live and make choices, and left to figure all of that out on their own, they make bad decisions, and their attitude toward learning is bad. They feel coerced into learning instead of it being this privilege they have. Let’s stop that. How do we stop that? It starts with the parents. I’m sorry, but we cannot build up the next generation without parents doing their jobs with their children. We’re fighting the wrong battles right now. We’re trying to figure out how to make the system better, how to regulate it so kids can physically not access porn instead of YouTube Education, but the problem is with the kid, not with the system. And the reason kids are making bad choices is because of a lack of good parenting in America today. Let’s address the issue. All you’re doing trying to reform systems is treating the symptom. “Oh look, the kid can’t use his tablet to access porn anymore.” That solves nothing. A kid that has the sort of attitude that will exploit academic freedom and resources to look at born has a problem with his motivations. That’s what needs to be addressed. And the only way to treat the disease instead of the symptom is with the parents. So get to work. Stop being lazy, kicking back after work and watching TV. Spend time with your kids. Stop being lazy just allowing them to do whatever they want, and make some rules in your household. Teach them about authority. Teach them good values. Start reading the Bible as a family. Because I promise, this is the hope for our future. It’s not in a new system, it’s in an old understanding that it’s a parents job to parent their children instead of just letting them go through life however they please and then blaming the teachers when they make bad decisions. That’s nonsense, and this is the kind of stupidity that’s sweeping across our nation, and it needs to be stop. If your kids are being stupid, beat them. There is hope in the rod. We need to get back to biblical values. And someone who spares the rod hates his son. But nobody in America believes that, and that’s our problem. We’ve __ in to this lie that spanking our kids is somehow immoral. I think we’ve seen the consequences of never disciplining our kids, and that should be enough for us to spit in the face of this leftist agenda to never show our children that there are consequences for bad decision-making. We as a nation need to remember our responsibilities as parents. “But I’m so busy.” Then you have no business having a child. You should’ve used a condom. If you make the decision to have children, you need to own up to the responsibilities that come with that, even if it means sacrificing your precious TV time after work. You can’t expect kids to just live right by default. You need to constantly be checking on them, constantly disciplining them, constantly loving and spending time with them, constantly figuring out what they’re going through, constantly giving them wisdom, and constantly being there for them. That’s the hope of our future, and until we own up to it, we will never take get anywhere in this nation.

Have you guys ever noticed that if you draw the outline of a simple house, it looks like an arrow pointing up? (Look at the “Home” button on your google Chrome browser.) It’s as if it’s testifying that this earth is not our home.

The problem with America is that parents hate their children. The Bible says whoever spares the rod hates his son. You say, “I don’t hate my children.” Then why aren’t you disciplining them? You say, “It’s unethical.” No that’s not unethical. What’s unethical is just letting your children decide for themselves how they’re going to live. And you wonder why they’re making bad decisions. From where I’m standing, it looks like you don’t care about them at all. Look, if your child comes home, and you were notified that they were accessing porn in the school, and you yell at them, it’s just going embitter them towards you. He’s going to go off and do it again. But if they came home, and you found at about the porn issue, and you beat them, do you think maybe he’ll get the message, “Don’t do it again?” You say, “That’s not what modern psychology supports.” I don’t give a rip about this pseudo-science of a discipline called psychology; what I care about are the facts. And we see it happening. People who are yelled get angry, people who are beaten get corrected. And yet we’ve bought in to this lie that using words is more effective spanking your kids. That’s nonsense, and we need to realize that it’s nonsense. And it’s unbliblical, and we need to get back to the principles of the Bible. God is smarter than we are. I don’t disagree with the establishment clause, that Biblical principle shouldn’t be legislated on the basis of faith in God. (However, like a patent, they need to be sort of unique to not be legislated—that is, if it’s an obvious principle that doesn’t depend on the Christian God, there’s no reason not to legislate it if the people agree on it.) But the free-exercise clause, in my opinion, prohibits us from making laws that prohibit the people from following biblical principles in our house. And so when you have the CPA knocking on someone’s door for disciplining their child, that’s not only unbiblical, that’s unconstitutional. I understand protecting children from abuse. But there are two kinds of abuse—two extremities that we should watch for. One of them goes overboard with beating the living daylights out of your children, which is completely unnecessary, and the point there is that it’s punitive justice instead of corrective justice, when the Bible makes a clear distinction between God’s punitive wrath towards his enemies and his corrective discipline towards his children (read Hebrews 10, I believe), which we need to follow; the other extremity, which I would also call abuse, is when parents just let kids off the hook without being corrected. And yelling at your kids, by the way, doesn’t correct them, it just alienates them. So I would consider that verbal abuse. But a disciplinary, corrective beating, that doesn’t alienate you kids. We see that in well behaved kids that love their parents. And the rod teaches a son wisdom, as well as obedience. They begin to understand why they were disciplined, and it makes them love their parents more, because it shows that their parents cared about them. Versus if you just let them do whatever they want, that shows a passive indifference, and your children get the vibe that you don’t care a lick about them. We see that all over. It sounds crazy, but that’s the way I felt. (And some kids will deny this, because everybody is self-interested in more freedom and less correction, but in the end, it’s not good for them, and it’s not good for society.) So much for your psychology, because that’s the way I felt. It’s one anecdote, but it’s enough to fly in the face of you telling me the best way to raise the next generation. Make sure they know what it’s for, make sure they know it’s because you love them, make sure they know it’s for their own correction, but don’t neglect to beat your children.

Sanctification isn’t inherent to salvation. Justification and glorification are, but sanctification comes by repentence, not by salvation. And repenteance is enabled through salvation, but it’s not automatic after you are saved.

“Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.” What was the condemnation of the devil? He was so prideful of his beauty that we challenged God. For this reason, novices in the faith should not become bishops. I can really resonate with this verse. In my noviceness, I became excessively prideful in all that I had learned, and the wisdom God entrusted to me, the mysteries of the gospel. Don’t let that happen.

Jesus said them that blaspheme the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven. And in the parable of the tenants, the tenants knew that it was the son whom they killed, but they desired his inheritance. I’m convinced the hypocrites knew who Jesus was, blasphemeing the Holy Spirit without ignorance that jesus was not casting out demons by the king of demons, but by the holy Ghost. Paul said this: “And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry; Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.” He was forgiven because he did it ignorantly in unbelief. In other words, when he blasphemed the Holy Spirit, underneath it all, he didn’t believe that jesus was God’s son. Because of that, he wasn’t blaspheming the Holy Ghost, but the son of God, because he didn’t believe. But if you know that he is the Son of God, and you blaspheme him, then you blaspheme the one who sent him, and the Holy Ghost within him, and you will not be forgiven.

## King James

Six times in the Hebrew you find the saying, “Them that pisseth against the wall.” All the newer translations will look at that and say, “Well, that’s not really appropriate so we’re just going to translate it, ‘men.’” But the Bible says the words of God are pure words, so the truth of the matter is, these new translators don’t really believe the Bible. “That’s inappropriate.” No, they’re pure words. But you don’t believe that, and therefore you have no business translating the Bible. Because you’re willing to just change it to say whatever you please in the name of “scholarship.” And I have family who are translators, I’m not saying they have this sedition agenda to usher in Satan’s kingdom, but what I’m saying is the greatest deceivers are those who are themselves deceived. The king James Bible just says, “That’s what it says, so that’s how we’ll translate it.” They were faithful, trusting God, not leaning on their own understanding, instead of saying, “Hmm, this doesn’t make sense. It’s probably a copyist error, so we’ll just change it.” Or, “Hmm, this doesn’t make sense; let’s figure out what it _really_ means, and just sort of paraphrase it so that people understand.” This is what’s going on today, and I’m ashamed to say it, but it’s true. And you’ll see that it’s true, because you can look at the Greek and Hebrew, and look at the English, and you’ll find footnotes and all kinds of things that show you what I’m saying is true. It sounds like this conspiracy theorist type argument that my dad would scoff at, but blessed is the man who sits not in the seat of scoffers. Listen to me, whatever their intentions are, however well meaning they are, nobody has the ministry of elaborating on the Bible and teaching for docrines the commandments of men. That’s what they’re doing. They’re filtering the Bible through their own understanding of it, and translating it the way they understand it instead of just what the raw text says, and people are buying these books and thinking they’re God’s word, but it’s actually a commentary. Because it’s what these translators think it means. And if something doesn’t make sense, they just toss it to the side and translate whatever is convenient for them. I’ll show you this. And I’m not going to teach you Greek, I can direct you to some resources I’ve put together to learn the alphabet and some of the words. The problem with modern day translations is the way that they translate it. The problem is they’re leaning on their own understanding, not recognizing that God’s ways are higher than our ways, and sometimes things aren’t going to make sense, but we need to translate it that way anyway, because if we tamper with God’s word, the whole point of your work, to help be an instrument in God’s promise to preserve his word, is awash. You haven’t preserved is word, you’ve perversed it. And the problem is that our modern day scholarship tosses faith in the Bible under the bus and approaches the translating process with our current rules of so-called scholarship. That’s not okay, and that’s why I stick with the King James Version by-and-large. If there’s a conflict, I’m going to assume the King James is right. Why? Not because I think it’s the reinspired incarnation of God’s word. There might be translation flaws somewhere. I’m not a believer in this “inspired translation” doctrine. But I’ll tell you what though: the reason I stick with the King James is because the way they translated it was with trust in God above trust in our own understanding. That’s the main, underlying reason that it’s the best translation, and tehre are no contradictions. The newer versions are full of contradictions that you have to do eisogetical acrobatics to get out of, and it’s a stumbling block to keeping false doctrine out of the church. The King James Bible has zero contradictions. Why? Because when things didn’t make sense to them, they just trusted God instead of changing it. They didn’t weigh it against other verses and say, “Wait a minute, here’s a contradiction! We need to figure out what it really means and translate it that way.” They just translated what it said. And ironically, it’s when people think there are contradictions, and change it so that there aren’t contradictions, that actually end up making contradictions. The first time they saw the contradiction, they just didn’t understand it correctly, and so they changed it to keep contradictions out. But because they changed it, it caused contradictions, because the raw text has no contradictions. If I see that the King James has departed from the TR, I’m going to stick with the TR. But so far, every conflict I’ve seen, it’s always the newer translations that forsake the TR and do it their own way. So I don’t think the King James is inspired, but I think it’s the most faithful translation of the book that is inspired. And it’s because they translated it in light of faith in God instead of faith in their own understanding.

There are a number of places that the King James translators erred in my judgement. For example, Acts 20:28, translating “bishop” at “overseer,” so that it is not evident to the English reader that “elders and bishops [were] originally and apostolically synonymous.” I’ve tagged all the places where I think the King James got it wrong in Olive Tree, and the reason I stick with it is because it’s infentestably smaller than the problems with the other translations. The translators have earned my trust.

## Evolution and atheism end

The dynamic of science is observation, explanation, prediction, experimentation. The more times the conditions of the explanation results in the same observation, the greater support for the explanation. But there is a flaw in this generalized standard. Let me show you this: Spontaneous Generation. It compiled so much evidence, that it was accepted in the scientific community for 500 years. Based on what? Based on predictive capability. Every time they put food out there, it grew mold. What’s the explanation? Life just spontaneously appears. (Just like the explanation of evolution is that genetics just spontaneously appear.) Every time the conditions of the explanation are met, the prediction is accurate. How did we discover it wasn’t true? Because that was the old way of doing science. Now we have microscopes, and all kinds of technology to see what’s going on. We can make observations within the observation to determine what’s really happening. Spontaneous generation has huge predictive capability, but it’s wrong. It’s a false explanation of the observation. So is evolution. What’s the standard to determine which explanation is correct? Do you know how they determined what the real explanation was? However they did it, that might be a clue as to what new standards ought to be. We need to craft a framework that accounts for this flaw of coincidences between two explanations (coincide-ences). Two completely different explanations might share the exact same experiments. Producing condition A to result in observation B. Control groups are one way of eliminating coincidences. But when the different explanations share the same conditional stimuli, you can’t separate the experiments into different control groups. You need different stimuli for that. So how do we do it?

God never says, “No TV.” But the Bible teaches principles that say TV is a foolish way to spend your time. Everybody has some hopocrisy in their life. TV is mine. I tell people they’d be wise to omit TV from their day to day life, but when lunch time comes around, I’m watching Gotham. “I can’t help it.” I can help it. I just haven’t made the decision to really fight against it. I enjoy TV shows, and it’s like sharpening an ax to spend some time relaxing throughout the day. It keeps me from burning out. But that’s the wrong attitude. Because what I’ve learned is the faster you run, the more energy you have to run faster. If God gave you grace to get started, who says he won’t give you more grace to run faster? People say, “You be careful, it’s a marathon, not a sprint.” But I’m going to tell you that’s straight from hell. I don’t to relax to sharpen my ax. I need to pray, and I need to fast. But I don’t need to watch TV at lunch time to keep productivity levels high throughout the rest of the day. Believe me, God can do more in 5 seconds then you can do in 5 hours. We’re all too busy not to pray. Start doing that during lunch instead of watching TV and you’ll see the fruit of effectiveness in your work. That’s what I believe, and yet, I watch TV with my lunch. I even watch it many days before bed.

## Marriage

Marriage isn’t about sharing burdens, or finding someone to help carry the load. It’s about sharing a life together. There’s sex, there’s laughter, there’s conversation, there’s arguments, there’s tears, there’s love, there’s perseverance, there’s disagreement, there’s tenderness, there’s disappointment, there’s joy and faithfulness, and it’s all a part of this beautiful thing we call marriage. Don’t just look for someone to help with the paychecks, and cooking, and cleaning; that’s not what it’s about. Don’t just ask yourself, “What can I add to this person’s life? That’s not what it’s about.

You can’t make unconditional love the foundation of your marriage, because if it’s unconditional than it extends to everyone and you only marry one person. You can’t make moonlit love the foundation of your marriage, because that fluctuates in and out, and the moment it fizzles out you’ll get a divorce. So what can you make the foundation of your marriage? People say, “Hold on a minute—I’m stilling fighting for unconditional love being the foundation.” I think that’s gross, but let’s hear what you have to say. “Eros is what conditionally causes you to select a partner, but agape is what keeps you from divorcing when Eros fades out of the picture.” Let’s see if that jives. And it’s correct. Your unconditional, platonic, affection-free love for your wife as a person will keep you from divorcing her when you stop loving her as a partner. Because you recognize that she depends on you, and unconditional love cares about people. So you might not throw the covenant aside, but your marriage goes down the drain anyway. Your love for your wife as a person will not maintain your affections for her as a partner. It just won’t. And so even if it sustains the covenant, it won’t by that necessity sustain the relationship. Eros is what sets someone apart in your initial decision to pick that person, and agape is what keeps her around when Eros isn’t keeping your affections secure. Here’s the problem I have with that: you don’t see that in the Bible anywhere. People are teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. The one thing that sustains your marriage, not just your covenant, but your marriage, is God. Listen, you might love someone without stipulation, but that love isn’t strong enough to anchor you to your vows. Nobody loves unconditionally. Do you love Hitler? There are certain conditions that he failed to meet, or else certain conditions that he transgressed, and you don’t love him. That shows that unconditional love is not perfected in you, and therefore you shouldn’t make it the standing point of your marriage. If there are certain conditions that can cause you to not love someone, than there are certain conditions that will put you in a disposition towards your wife. “Love is… 1 Cor. 13—if you meet that, then you will have a good marriage.” But we fall short of it, don’t we? And if we fall short with other people, we will fall short with our wife. Because it’s either unconditional or it’s not. And so we see that this kind of love fluctuates as well (for most people—everyone has different levels of sanctification). You can’t make your marriage depend on you having feelings towards your wife (Eros), or you making decisions to stick with her (agape), because both kinds of love fluctuate. We think of Agape as a decision that we make, but it’s not. It’s a battle that we fight. When we respond to people in a way that transgresses love, did you make the decision to do that, or was it a reaction from your sinful nature? If is from the realms of choicelessness that we treat people in violation of love. The choice is us guarding our hearts with all diligence, setting up watchmen to alert us when our enemy is coming to tempt us. If we neglect to do that, than sin isn’t a choice. The choice was in falling asleep while the devil is prowling around, but our choice wasn’t to get eaten. And so it’s a constant battle, and I think anyone will admit that there are times when they haven’t guarded themselves against the temptations of sin to not love someone unconditionally. There are times when you have violated love, because of something called indwelling sin. And you can’t depend on something that’s a constant fight, because sometimes you’re winning, and sometimes you’re losing.

If it’s unconditional that means it’s because of who you are, not because of you they are, which

Have you heard the news about Jesus? I’m trying to imagine the way the disciples would have evangelized. Knocking on doors, maybe not, but going through the public square, how did they proclaim Jesus? All of these people today talking about strategies on how to cast the net, what bait to use, how to draw it in, but Jesus just said, “Cast it on the other side of the boat.” It’s just our job to scatter seed. It’s the kind of soil they are that’s going to determine what they do with it, not Plato’s 3 pillars of persuasion. I think that’s what’s always kind of deterred me from these modern evangelism techniques. It’s as if nobody knows their Bible. And if they do, they don’t live like they believe it. Because God said it’s vanity to prepare you horse for battle, because victory because to the Lord. So why are you wasting your time putting your efforts towards getting all your horses ready for battle, when God said, “No, don’t trust in your horses. Don’t trust in your numbers, David, trust in me.” “Sorry, Gideon, you have a great plan, but it’s not my plan, because if they think for one second it wasn’t my power, they’re going to think it was their own power, and then they’re going to trust themselves instead of me.” But that’s exactly what we’re doing with our soul-winning techniques. It sin’t just, “Trust God and throw your net to the side of the boat,” it’s, “Begin with your testimony, make sure you exmplain this part clearly, jump from this verse to that verse, be sure to…” and we’re trying to sell the gospel to people. But when you look at Jesus, it’s like he was doing everything he could to keep people from jumping on board. “The son of man has no place to rest his head.” “Take up your cross daily.” “No one who looks back is worthy of me.” If people will accept it, they’ll accept it when you preach the gospel. Faith comes by hearing, and by hearing the words of Christ, not by hearing how much God has done in your life. Look, all these testimonies I keep hearing are basically, “My life used to suck, then Jesus happened, and now it’s awesome.” “I used to be on drugs, always wasted, but then Jesus cleaned me up.” If I tell someone about my testimony, it’s going to be the truth: my life used to be awesome, and then I gave everything up to follow him. That’s your testimony. You don’t go from rags to riches in the gospel, you sell everything you have. That’s what I hate about these modern techniques. We’re walking commercials.  But when I really understood the gospel, I realized nothing I have down here is really mine. Right? Because I realized that the things of the world are passing away, and it doesn’t make a lot of sense to just accumulate as much as I can down here and then die and have nothing in heaven. But Jesus said, whatever you give up on earth, you will receive 100-fold in heaven, where moth doesn’t eat, rust doesn’t destroy, and robbers don’t come in and steal.

I think pathos should be banned as a tool of legislative persuasion. You can’t derive a rule from the anecdote. I’m sorry for that little girl, but her father should have thought about how it might hurt her before committing a crime. Those consequences were there before he decided he wasn’t going to submit to American law, and he was a stupid son of the devil who got what he deserved. … my heart feels bad about what I’m saying. Even though I agree with it intellectually, I have a problem with it compassionately. I think it comes from wanting standards in the macro but compassion in the micro. Usually I feel good about making my case, but sometimes the Holy Spirit convicts me and instead of feeling fly about making a good argument I feel condemned about searing my conscience.

If you’re somebody who doesn’t understand indwelling sin, try and stay awake for 5 days straight, and you will understand what indwelling sin is. It isn’t something you just choose. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak. The reason you are sinning is because of your flesh.

“There's nothing wrong with that. Female masturbation is completely natural and anyone who says differently is either a woman-hating sexist (because they think it's only normal for boys to masturbate) or denies natural human urges (because they claim masturbation is wrong in general). Watching porn isn't strange, either (unless it’s child or animal porn or something). Women have the same sexual urges that men do and it's CULTURE not nature that says only men can act on them.” That’s nonsense. To presume anyone has the capacity to determine the motivations of people who disagree with you is arrogant at best. It’s silly to demonize people who disagree with you using binary logic of, “If you disagree with me then you just hate women.” Maybe they just look at the facts instead of appealing to ad hominem belittlements. What, facts? A new concept to you? Because a women has nearly 20 times less testosterone then men, their sexual urges are not at all comparable. They are driven by estrogen, which acts very differently. Estrogen looks for trust and strength, while testosterone looks for fertility. So while it’s true that women have sexual urges, it doesn’t make me a women-hating sexist to say that it isn’t normal for women to be aroused by purely physical cues of strength. That actually means something is wrong with her evolutionary instint to find a mate she can trust, and it’s going to cause relationship problems if she doesn’t have that natural prerequisite of trust. Women can masturbate, sure, but if they are being aroused by visuels separated from fantasy, no, that’s not natural. That is not how female behavior is automated. You can accuse me of hating women for citing the facts, but frankly I think it’s a lack of care on your part not to be concerned for someone who’s urges have transgressed thousands of years of female instinct. That can be a real problem, and it isn’t hateful to acknowledge that. That’s what caring about someone does. And so yes, women, it is contrary to nature for you to be aroused by a random picture of a penis. You ought to get bored of porn pretty quickly and find you prefer explicit romance novels.

It’s possible these strange bones we’ve apparently found (which I still haven’t seen) that everybody says is the missing link, Neanderthals, are actually Nephilim (human-angel hybrid), which were called giants, mighty men of war. Every drawing I’ve seen depicted they were more brute and masculine than homo sapiens. But it seems very likely to me that the supposed hunter-gather era of human history was between the fall (when we lost our calling of ruling and subduing the earth) and the flood (when our calling was restored). Think about it, the Bible says the earth was full of violence. That sounds like the kind of disorder inherent to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, where we’re running around trying to find something to eat instead of domesticating animals and crops. “The world was filled with violence.” It’s something to think about.

Sometimes I wonder if we as Christians understand that when Christ comes again, he’s coming with a sword, and he will establish his reign in a very rebellious world. I don’t know about you, but when he comes back, I want to be on his team. I don’t want him to look over at me and say, “You compromised, and sold out to the world. You consented with their twisted judgement in calling good evil and evil good.” I want him to know I was faithful unto death. “I never compromised your judgements for anything.” I want him to know that I judged with right judgement, and I don’t care what the world calls it or whether they agree, in fact I hope they don’t agree, lest I make friendship with the world a thing to be grasped. If they hate God, let them hate me also. If they agree with God’s judgements, what’s to stop them from receiving mercy? Then they are no longer the world, but the kingdom of God, ambassadors in the world. God is a thousand times more terrifying than the world. Don’t you want to be a part of establishing his reign when he returns? A warrior who never compromised? Be bold for Jesus in the world we live in now. Learn how to treat people, learn how to stand on God’s word, and learn how to provclaim with boldness the word of the testimony, unashamed of the gospel of Christ, unashamed of the mercy you so willingly received in humility, and unashamed of the wisdom of the cross which is foolishness to them that are perishing. We will encounter people who think they are smarter than us. And they probably are. Jesus said, “I praise you, Fatehr, that it was pleasing in your sight to reveal these things to infants and withhold them from the wise.” We’ve been entrusted with the mysteries of God. That’s not exactly a compliment, but it’s enough for us to realize than when people reducule us for the gospel, we ought to stand firm with boldness in proclaiming the truth unashamed. The fool says in his heart, “There is no God.” Why do I care if a fool thinks I’m foolish? There is no weight to his judgement. He’s so smart that he can make something as stupid as atheism sound plausible. It takes an excessive lack of wisdom to be smart enough to deceive yourself into believing a lie. He can’t even acknowledge what’s been clearly perceived since the creation of the world. That’s how foolish he is. And you care what he says about you? I do too, because whatever he says about God, that’s what I want him to say about me too. If he mocks and ridicules God, I want him to mock and ridicule me too. If he hates God in his heart, I hope he hates me in his heart right alongside. That’s what we should strive for. Not this twisted “I just need the world to love me,” nonsense. That’s friendship with the world, and that’s enmity with God. Think about it; if they hate God, why would they love you? Unless you are a rebellious son who hasn’t striven to be transformed by the renewal of your mind to discern the will of God in all things? If you look just like God, your judgements are the same as God’s, you discern his will and do it, why in the world would they love you if they hate God? I hope they hate me with the same measure of hatred they have towards God.

I am going to show you something truly fantastic! I should say truly amazing. Fantastic is sort of a… misused word.

One of the thigns I struggle with most is watching TV. The stories, the excitement, the thrill of it all. It’s captivating. But it’s a substitute for God. It’s just a cheap imitation of the kind of thrill, and fear, and excitement we were created for. And I’ve never felt that watching TV was a sin. Don’t get me wrong. But, “Is it a sin?” is about the lowest question you can ask. When I’m standing in the kitchen making my lunch, and I’m deciding whether to spend my lunch break on my computer doing some kind of work or watching a TV show, I don’t feel God pressuring me and condemning me not to watch TV, I just get convicted that it’s a foolish waste of time, and there’s the freshness of fall to be had when you’re free from wasting your time. Watching TV does not help me run the race which is set before me. That’s the point. It’s not that it’s a sin, it’s just that it doesn’t help me run. So that’s why I’m typing this up during my lunch break right now—I decided TV was keeping me from the fullest measure of knowing the riches of Christ in me that I’m capable of.

Why do I know so much about the laws of attraction? It was my escape—my way out. When I was younger I used to think, “I don’t have to guard myself against committing fornication. How would you even initiate something like that? It would take intentionality, and work. I don’t need to be cautious. I don’t need rules that say, ‘Never be alone with a girl.’ I wouldn’t know the first thing about seducing a girl even if I wanted to.” But when I was older, I started to realize, sex just kind of happens. Maybe you study together, the two of you are at her apartment, one thing leads to another, you work a little, you laugh a little, there’s this sexual gravity in the way you look at each other, and literally it takes zero initiation. The point was that she trusted me completely, and that was enough for her to feel naked around me and like it. There’s natural seduction, and I never knew how to craft the situation to keep it in purity, and so it was really awkward to just deflect every coy attempt she made to entice my reciprocal affections. “I feel like I can be totally naked with you.” “Well, from an evolutionary perspective (this is actually pretty interesting) women are hardwired to look for behavioral cues of trust. It’s actually nothing personal at all. Pure science, a very primitive instinct that’s thousands of years outdated. Completely obsolete in today’s day and age.” … “Do you know what attraction is? It’s your body’s way of trying to trick you into reproducing. Think about it: everything in nature is set up to make more of itself, even at the expense of painful labors. But given that there are 7 billion homo sapiens on the globe, overpopulation is a bigger concern than reproducing to keep the species alive, and since there’s no cap on attraction to temper our numbers, the way people are naturally inclined to reproduce is an evolutionary flaw. It’s very interesting, there is a specious, something like a gazelle, that in the absence of predators, they overpopulate, disease runs rampant, and they all die out. Haha! They actually need predators to survive. Talk about obsolete instincts! So yeah, these silly little inclinations we have towards people are grounded in a primitively archaic evolutionary flaw that’s slowly driving us to extinction, something we’d be wise to desensitize. One theory I had is that natural selection actually does account for overpopulation, and that’s why we’re seeing a rise in homosexuality today. But I think that’s a stretch. How would this mysterious thing called natural selection be able to quantify the number of homo sapiens in the world? It’s absurd.” It was still pretty awkward, but at least it gave me something to say instead of just a frozen blank stare, “Uhh… Weeelllll.”

I just had a very confusing thought. Paul said, “Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid. What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh. But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.” Here’s what confuses he: When you commit fornication, the two become one flesh, not one spirit, as evinced both by the saying, and in Jesus words, “There is no marriage in heaven.” When you die, you’re no longer one flesh, and if fornication made you one spirit, then that oneness would continue when you put off your flesh. Do you see the problem? Paul says, “Your **bodies** are the members of Christ,” right before he changes his mind saying, “But he that is joined unto the Lord is one **spirit**.” So if Christ is joined with my spirit, how can the members of Christ be made to be joined to an harlot? If my own spirit is not joined to the harlot by fornication, but my flesh, and we are joined with Christ in one spirit, not our bodies (for our mortal bodies are hostile to God, Romans 8:6-7, 23), how may it be said that fornication will make Christ one with an harlot? It cannot. But the members of Christ, which is your spirit (for we are one spirit), is said to be made one. But elsewhere it is evident that that which is spirit is not bound by fornication, but only the flesh. So we may infer that even our corrupt flesh, our mortal bodies which may be joined to an harlot, are the members of Christ, not by being made one spirit with him, but by being purchased. – (While looking for the place where it says, “You are not your own, but you were bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body,” thinking it to be Romans 12, it was in the same passage. Paul, evidently, was aware that people would think the way I just did.) – For the apostle says, “What?  know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.” So then it is not for the oneness of the spirit that your bodies are the members of Christ, but because your bodies are the temples of the Holy Ghost, and because you were purchased so that you are not your own, but a steward of the body you have. Lest there be any confusion: glorify God in your body, because it is the temple of the Holy Ghost,  and in your spirit, because it is joined with Christ. Your body and your spirit are God’s, not just your spirit which is joined with him. It is as a wife whose body is joined to her husband, but all that she possesses, her chair, her ass, her jug of water, were purchased by the husband. It is like as Ruth, whose body was joined with Boaz, but all that she possessed, the land of her father, was purchased by the man and now belongs to him. So our possessions, this body, now belongs to Christ, and our spirit is made one with him. Let Ruth glorify Boaz both with her body, which is joined with his, and the land of her father, which belongs to Boaz, that she should not give it to another. Yet we who are the Lord’s have given our land away (which belongs to him), joining it with harlots in fornication. God forbid!

I think soul just means “breath in your lungs.” All the componants of your body, your DNA, your anotomy, every cell you need can be there, but without a soul, you’re dead. When somebody dies on a deathbed, what’s the difference between when he was alive and dead? Every cell that was there when he was alive is still there. They just stopped functioning the way they used to. The blood stopped pumping, and the lungs stopped breathing. Why? Because his soul departed. His soul died. “The soul that sins will die.” If you study that passage, it’s clear that he’s not talking about hell. He’s talking about a balanced justice system where a criminal is put to deathf or his own crimes instead of the crimes of his father.

You want my advice? Smile your way through life. People think they can trust a happy person.

Everything is gospel for me. Someone could say, “You look good today,” and I’m going to say, “We all look good under certain lighting. That’s why when the light entered the world, men loved the darkness. Because when you step into the light, and all of your blemishes and all of your flaws are revealed, you don’t look good anymore. But let me tell you something, the light that reveals your blemishes, that’s Jesus, is the same light that can purify your soul. His blood was spilled to cleanse you, but you have to step into the light. And when he came into the world, men loved the darkness more and rejected the light because they wanted to hold on to the deception of how good they look when no one can see them, but to as many as received the light, to as many as received Jesus, they were given the right to become children of God. My question to you, is have you received the light?” That’s just how I operate. It’s Jesus all day long. How could anything be more interesting to talk about that the creator of the universe coming down to indwell his children? And you want to talk about the latest episode of The Bachelor. I really have nothing to talk about except Jesus. Everything else drives me crazy out of boredom. I mean, it’s God. Do you understand that? Everything you want to talk about is just pitiful little substitutes and cheap imitations of what we were created for. If you could just open yourself to the thrill and excitement and awe of the genuine, real pleasure of experiencing the presence of God, everything else would just be marshmallows against a table of meat. It’s just like, “How much of that can you stand? At first there’s this weak, sort of miserable little jolt of pleasure that I understand, but don’t you get sick of it?” I’m sick of it. And every time someone offers me a marshmallow, I’m like, I don’t want to be rude, but I have something so much better, and you can too.

The reason I’m not a social learner is because I’m a through learner, and most people are not thorough in their explanations. They want to be as quick and efficient as possible. Maybe they tell you analogies that helped them understand it, but what I’m concerned about is the primal, root questions about why it works, not with illustrations to carry over ideas. “Why?” “Because option premium only moves the delta amount per dollar in the underlying.” But why? I want to know about how implied volatility, time, and delta all work together, but I don’t know that’s what I want to know because I don’t know it yet. I can’t frame the questions to fish for what I want to know, all I can do is say, “Why?” and that’s frustrating to people. “Because that’s just how it works.” Aka: “I don’t know. That’s just what I learned, and I didn’t question why.” But that isn’t good enough for me. The reason most people are not thorough explainers is because they are not thorough learners. And because I am, nothing makes sense. For me, there are no assumptions. I don’t like to just assume the premise, “This is how delta works” without providing support for it. Without getting underneath the thing beneath the thing. And so when you’re trying to move on to the next piece of information, I’m still trying to figure out delta, and you’re getting frustrated that I’m not keeping up. Versus on my own, books, articles, videos, and google don’t get impatient with me for not just trusting premises without understanding them. I can burrow as long as it takes.

We hear it all the time, but when you really feel it, it’s over. You’re free from the fear of what people think about you. If God is for me, who can be against me? When I was summoned for jury duty for the first time, I cut my hair, started styling it again, read through my Bussiness Law textbook to brush up on legal terms, and then it hit me. It’s not my job to perform for them. It’s not my job to persuade them, it’s their job to persuade me, and my job persuade God that I’m judging rightly. When that it me, I was released from the fear of saying something stupid, and not being able to orate my opinions with conviction. All I had to worry about was persuading God that I was judging with right judgement. What does that look like? When I’m sitting in the jury area, am I thinking, “How can I make God’s commandments sound reasonable to these people?” or am I thinking, “Okay, God is watching me, how can I persuade him that love his judgements? How can I demonstrate to God that I’m on his team?” Because if I’m on his team then he’ll help me and use me, and I’ll have nothing to worry about. How can I show God that I’m fully devoted to him? Because I read this scripture in the Bible: the eyes of the LORD move to and fro throughout the earth that He may strongly support those whose heart is completely His. All of us should be concerned with showing ourselves to be fully committed to God and stop worrying about what people think about us. Do we believe this verse or not? Do we want God’s help or not? I don’t know about you, but I’m going to go after this thing. Am I thinking, “How can I make the Bible sound rational to these people, and reasonable enough so that the world accepts it,” or am I thinking, “How can I persuade God that I accept it?” The first one is where a lot of people are at, and I’m going to tell you it’s straight from hell. We think we’re doing well to try and justify God, and defend his judgements, and reason everything out and make it sound rationale so that unbelievers will accept it, but the truth is the word of the cross is foolishness to them that are perishing. And when you need to justify the wisdom of the cross before them that are perishing, that shows that you covet their love above their well being. You want to be their friends, and you want them to accept you, and so you try and justify the Bible to them when you should be trying to get them saved. And if they reject the gospel, move on to someone else. Jesus said the harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. We’re not going to finish the job before Jesus comes back. Let’s not linger on one seed that we planted and keep digging it up to see if there’s any growth. Let’s just scatter the seed. That’s our job. But we’re too concerned with whether or not the world loves us and thinks we’re smart or not, … I’m not saying don’t have an answer for the hope that is in you when people ask, but what I’m saying is the way we do evangelism is not by trying to solicit the question, “Why do you have hope?” That’s not our primary mission. Paul said that friendship with the world is enmity with God. Why? Because friendship is when you want someone to like you, and when you covet the world’s love above God’s love, you’re right back where you started. We should love the world enough to be their enemies, instead of just going along with them setting themselves on fire because we don’t want them to hate us for opposing them. “You’re going to burn yourself!” “Shut up, stupid Christian. Leave me alone.” Maybe some of them will actually listen and turn and be saved! Love the world. Don’t be their friends. Be their enemies. And stop trying to pretend like we’re all on the same side, we’re all allies, just like Jehosephat, which God said he acted wickedly in doing so. This isn’t a rationale discussion where we each have a turn to try and present our arguments. This is life and death. It’s not our job to sound smart at the expense of letting people die. It’s our job to preach the gospel unto all creation with boldness, unashamed of the foolishness of the cross to them that are perishing, because we don’t covet the praise of men, we covet the praise of God. It all comes down to this: which audience are you living before?

This really is where liberty comes from. You don’t have to be smart before God. Wisdom comes from God. He always does all the work, and all we have to do is trust him. That’s what we see in the whole Bible. We never have to be worried, we never have to be concerned with if we’re good enough, or capable enough, or smart enough. It’s always all about people who trust the promises of God. And that’s how we’re called to live. We never have to be nervous about whether we impress people or not, because it’s not about impressing people with how good we are, it’s about impressing God with how faithful we are. Do you see this? It’s not about the insecurity of always trying to be good enough and never knowing if you will be; it’s about the security that comes from trusting the promises of God. If I trust God, than I’m secure, and I have nothing to worry about. Trusting him is my performance. All I need to be nervous about is how much I trust him. And when I trust him, I’m not nervous. It’s built in. I’m like Jonathan with his armor bearer, “2+God vs. 30? Let’s go!” He doesn’t have to worry about his training, his skill, his strength. The only question is, “Do I trust God’s promises? Do I trust that God is with me and will fight for me?” And when that’s your only question, when your only question is whether you trust God’s promises, and you trust his promises, “I will give you everywhere the soul of your foot touches,” all that’s left is your you to run. All that’s left is for you to walk out the faith you say you have. All that’s left is to march around Jericho and watch God deliver it into your hands. That’s liberty. That’s security and freedom from the fear of people. You don’t have to perform for them anymore. Your only concern is demonstrating to God how much you trust him. “Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee, because he trusts thee.” Why? Because I’m not worried about impressing people, I’m worried about impressing God with my faith. And it says, “Because he trusts thee.” When you trust God, that’s where perfect peace comes from. That’s where the absence of insecurity, and nervousness comes from. This is what it’s all about. Let’s walk it out. Let’s stop being worried about what people say and think about us. Let’s be worried what God says and thinks about us. He’s scarier, so it seems like it should be a greater burden, and it would be, except that Jesus said, “Come to me all ya who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest, for my burden is light and my yoke is easy.” If we didn’t have the promises of God, it would be much more terrifying to answer to him rather than men. But since Jesus already did everything, and all we need to do is trust him, it’s easy. It’s incredibly easy. There’s security and peace and comfort in the arms of our father.

Do you really live your life that way? Of not being aware that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you? It’s never you and me alone. “We’re not alone—Holy Spirit.” That’s not just theological conjecture. That’s reality. And it’s the way I live my life, and if you don’t live your life that way, you’ll never have peace and you’ll never know joy, because David says, “In thy presence is fullness of joy.” Sometimes I say that, and people just kind of smile like, “Oh right, ‘Holy Spirit’” with a hint of sarcasm in their voice, as if, “Sure, that’s the right answer, but it’s not like he’s actually here.” Then what are we talking about? This isn’t Christian hypocrisy, it’s Christian enigma. Our theology is inconsistent with the way we “really” think about things, and the way we automate behavior. People just live in a paradox because they haven’t thought through it. Look, if the Spirit of the one who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, and you believe it, and you live your life that way, you’re not going to live like normal people. You just won’t. God is your counselor and he’s always available to you. What more can you ask for? This is something so huge that I see a lot of Christians totally neglect. You look like little butterflies who just came out of the cocoon, wallowing around in the dirt because you haven’t realized you have wings. But if I say, “Hey, you have wings!” You kind of go, “Of course I do, [wink, wink].” “No, you can fly!” “That’s right! Amen.” ...do you see this? It’s like, no matter what I tell you, you agree with it, but you’re still sitting there wallowing in the dirt. What is it going to take? If you have the Holy Spirit, live like it. If you have wings, take flight. Don’t just acknowledge intellectually, “Yep, that’s theologically true,” and neglect to acknowledge it experientially.

We are not friends. See, this is actually very hard for me because my natural inclination is to just get along with everyone and be friends, but I read in the Bible about King Jehoshaphat, the it says he was a righteous king except in acting wickedly by allying himself with wicked kings. And the Bible says friendship with the world in enmity with God. You’re the world, I’m God’s child, and if I’m friends with you that means I’m enemies with God. So we’re not friends. Now that doesn’t mean I don’t love you. Because friendship, in the Bible, just means to go along with, and enemy means to oppose, and so God is saying, “Hey, they are headed for destruction, and I don’t want you to just go along with them and let them walk straight into hell, I want you to oppose them, be their enemy.” And you say, “Why enemy?” Well, when you oppose people’s decisions, they don’t like you. There’s enmity. Verses if you see someone who’s making destructive decisions, and you say, “Well, it’s none of my business, and I don’t want to offend them, so I’m just going to let them keep setting themselves on fire.” That’s what the Bible means by friendship with the world. Because what do I mean by, “I don’t want to offend them?” What I’m really saying is, “I covet your love for me above your wellbeing.” What do we think of parents like that? Parents who never oppose their children? They don’t really love their children. And so what I’m saying is that because I love you, and because I cherish your wellbeing over your personal feelings towards me, I am willing to be your enemy for the sake of you escaping hell. And so I will oppose you, and you will hate me, and if I didn’t care about your soul, I would just get along with you and be friends, and never say anything to oppose you, because I covet you acceptance, I want you to like me, but because I care about your wellbeing more than I care about being accepted by you, I will oppose you. That’s the point here. I love you, enough to be your enemy.

That whole carrot thing, trying to undermine positive motivation—people are not animals that think in the binary of, “Hungry. Food. Go.” Steven Anderson—“my kids are not dogs.” People that make homeschooling their life. Dude that sells book and people have accidentally killed their kids expounding his advice.

Nowhere does the Bible ever call heaven paradise, but what you have in the book of enough is a description of 4 intermediary states before judgement, 2 for the wicked and two for the righteous, and it calls the two for the righteous, quote, “Paradise.” The only place that the Bible unequivocally says where Jesus spent those 3 days is when it says, “We went to hell.” The other places you have to make inferences. “You will be with me this day in paradise.” When is this day? Where is paradise? You have to make assumptions. “I went to my Father.” Where is your Father? “To be absent from the body is to be with the Lord.” That’s what Jesus said to the thief on the cross. “You will be with me in paradise.” Where is that? Here’s what I think: The psalmist says, “In thy presence is fullness of joy.” And we know he wasn’t in heaven because in the first place, he wasn’t dead when he wrote that, and secondly, Jesus said no man hath ascended into heaven except the one who has descended from heaven, so David wasn’t in heaven. And yet he can speak about the presence of God, or being with the Lord. And if the two intermediary states for the righteous can be described as paradise, then there must be joy there, which means God’s presence must be there, because that’s where the psalmist says joy comes from. So there is a shadowy, dim, taste of the presence of God, and then there is glorification, when we will experience the fullness of God’s presence, when we see him just as he is, but John says that won’t happen until after the judgement, which hasn’t happened. So I think when Jesus said, “I will be with you in paradise,” that means his secondary presence, as spoken about in the psalms, will be in the intermediary state of sleep, described as paradise in the book of Enoch, where the thief is going to be until the resurrection of our mortal bodies.

Soul sleep: I think there is a 6th stage of sleep, deeper than REM, which is the two places of paradise for the righteous, which would explain all the variances between people’s books who’ve written about after death experiences. Every single one of them conflicts with the Bible or conflicts with each other. That only makes sense if their experience was essentially a dream that was deeper than REM.

“Does it ever happen where one bank teller says the assailant was 5’10” and one said the assailant was 6’2”? So, that’s evidence. You’ve got evidence that he’s 5’10” and evidence that he’s 6’2”, he just can’t be both. The word ‘evidence,’ while fancy and legal, the reality is, you find facts, and then the finder of the fact can draw conclusions and inferences from those facts.” ~ [Trey Gowdy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GUB-Q2Nd0I)

“There’s always conflicting recollections of facts, some of which are central, some of which are peripheral.” ~ [James Comey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GUB-Q2Nd0I)

“You’re parsing that one a little bit for me.” [[1]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GUB-Q2Nd0I)

I’m not accusing him because he’s black, I’m accusing him because he violated standards of decent conduct in professional settings; you, on the other hand, are defending him because he’s black. That’s discrimination. Martin Luther’s dream was that people of all ethnicities would be judged on the content of their character, not that some people would be immune from judgement because they are members of a particular ethnicity. And that’s what you’re doing here.

Stop accusing me of treating black people unfairly by painted Americans with a broad brush and putting me under that generalization. I have never treated a black person in an inconsistent manner with which I would treat a white person, and I can say with conviction that the vast majority of people I know follow the same standards of judging people on the content of their character instead of their skin color. What divides people is when you fabricate discrimination where it doesn’t exist in an attempt to exculp someone from liability because they feel like their class is oppressed. If you commit a crime, you are liable for it. End of story. If you are treated unfairly, let’s address those specific situations, but we can’t just take the anecdote and say that are entire justice system is flawed. It’s not flawed. Some people in it are flawed, and we need to address them person by person. The system doesn’t need to be amended. It needs to be enacted.

We were in the car on our way to church one day, and my sister was reading something and remarked, “Huh. Nothing you do for the Lord is useless.” And I said, “That’s not true.” And she said, “Yes it is. New Living Translation.” I opened up my KJV and it read, “in the Lord,” instead of, “Of the Lord.” And At first it seams like it’s just a talking point, but what I was thinking of when I objected the first time is in Matthew 15 when Jesus said, “Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition? For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death. But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.” All the newer translations, including the NLT, expounds, “given to God.” So according to your own translations, you can do things for God that he didn’t ask you to do, and insodoing transgress his commandment. This is why it’s important to discern the will of God, because we can work all day and be really busy for God, but at the end of the day, were you doing what he wanted? Just because you have religious motives underlying your behavior doesn’t mean God is pleased with what your are doing _for_ him.

When we talk about a sort of romantic inclination towards someone, there are several things going. What you have is 3 distinct factors at play, namely, attraction, affection, and then love. You do not choose your attractions, but you can choose who you respect, and ultimately your affections are a derivative of things you respect about people. So attraction is at the physicological level (men look for physical cues of fertility, women look for physical cues strength and behavioral cues of trust), affection is at a more personal level (asking the question, “Do I like her as a person?” Better to live on the corner of a roof than to share a house with a quarrelsome wife), what is love? I mean, there’s the body, and there’s the person operating the body. What more is there? Haven’t we covered all the basis? If I’m going to talk about “her,” doesn’t that amount to body and person? What is love? Love is a very nebulous word that has been used and misused a lot. What role does it play it my decision to ask someone, “Will you go through life with me?” (Most of Proverbs 31 is a letter from a mother telling her son to base that decision on affection rather than attraction. Because attraction is based in evolution. Attraction asks the question, “Is this person a suitable companion to help in the process of reproduction?” Everything in nature is set up to make more of itself. “Be fruitful and multiply.” In 2017, that’s not a concearn anymore. We have populated the earth so much, that a bigger concern is too much being fruitful and multiplying. But it’s still hardwired in our primitive brains: “Survival.” We’re all trying to keep our specious alive. That’s what attraction is based in. And Solomon’s mom has the wisdom to say, “There’s more to marriage keeping our specious alive.” No matter what, as you get older, you become less fertile, and your body becomes less attractive. If people get married based on attraction, you better fear old age, because you’re going to split up as soon as she’s not attractive anymore. But Solomon’s mom says, “No, there’s more to it. Charm is deceitful and beauty is fleeting.” Huh. Charm and beauty. What’s charm? It’s when you make people like you. Right? That’s affection. Charm is when you look at someone and if they have it, you are affectionate towards them. What’s beauty? It’s when you look at someone, and if they have it, you are attracted to them. This mother just basically pinned down these two things that we’ve been talking about and decries them as deceitful and fleeting. She’s saying the evolution thing is obsolete, and the personal thing can be manipulated, so don’t base your marriage on either one of them. Well, if I can’t base it on attraction, and I can’t base it on affection, what’s left? “A woman that feareth the Lord shall be praised.” Base your decision to get married on whether or not she fears the Lord. Why? “She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.” I want to pause right here and highlight something that I think is very important: all the days of her life. The reason attraction is a bad gauge for a good marriage is because its only concern is populating the earth. That’s it. There’s a science to attraction that is ultimately rooted in tricking you into reproducing. It’s hardwired in the brain, and it’s not something you choose.

Love is a word that we throw around when we have a hard time articulating what we feel towards someone. And it’s understandable, because there are some things at interplay with each other. It’s like if someone were to make a smoothie, and asks you, “What’s in here?” It’s hard to go back and figure out the ingredients from the end result. And so instead of talking about the individual ingredients, you might just give the whole thing a name, we’ll call it “Tropical Blast,” so that when someone asks, “What is it?” you can just say, “Tropical Blast” instead of trying to break down the individual components. But in the end, that’s not useful, because now you have a name for it, but it doesn’t tell you anything about what it actually is. And that’s the way I feel about the word “love.” It’s a word that’s been assigned to this complex, interlocking set of ingredients, and we have a hard time pinning down what they are, because all we can taste is the whole thing already blended up. (We can talk about the Greeks later, but right now I’m only talking about Eros, because none of the other kids of love have to do with marriage. And there is disagreement about that, but it is my firm conviction.) And so I’m going to argue that love is basically comprised of two things: attraction and affection. Those two things are what will get you into a marriage. They may not be what keeps you there, but they are what initiates it (i.e. unconditional love for them as a person might refrain you from divorcing when your conditional love for them as a wife goes in and out—and your love for someone as a wife _is_ conditional; for example, it depends on the condition that she has to be a woman). Here’s what I want to point out: if we define love the way I’m defining it, as attraction + affection, then Proverbs 31 is saying, “Don’t marry for love, but for fear of the Lord.” Sorry Cinderalla, I guess Kits dad was wrong at the end when he said, “Don’t marry for advantage. You must marry for love.” Why? Because the components of love, attraction and affection, manifest in charm and beauty, are deceitful and fleeting. You must not marry for love. But all of you 1 Corinthians 13 jokers, notice she never says you should marry for agape. “If you have agape _towards_ her, then you can marry her,” is a flawed way of thinking because agape is _unconditional_, meaning it doesn’t depend on the subject. In other words, you don’t love them because of who they are, but because of who you are. So if you have agape, than it can’t be talked about as “towards someone” but “in you.” That’s why it says, “God is love.” 1 Corinthians 13 is not a checklist for marriage, it’s a description of love in us that extends to all people without stipulation. If that had anything to do with marriage, none of us would get married, because you can’t just ask, “Am I patient, kind, not envious, not boastful, not arrogant or rude, not insisting on my own way, not irritable or resentful, not rejoicing at wrongdoing, rejoicing in truth, bearing all things, believing all things, hoping all things, enduring all things, _toward her_,” because even if you are, that’s not agape, because it’s conditional on that one person. Agape is in you, not towards a subject if the condition of it being that person is met. I’m sure you are well meaning people who try and hammer in 1 Corinthians 13 as a checklist for marriage, but it’s flawed, and it’s wrong, it’s teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. Here’s the principle of finding a wife: find someone who fears the Lord. That’s it. Don’t worry about love, don’t worry about agape, just find someone who fears the Lord. That’s what the Bible says. And do you know why? Because 1 Corinthians 13 is too impossible to ever fulfil. There will be quarrels, and there will be fighting, and there will be problems, and the reason you make the fear of the Lord the basis of your marriage is because 1 Corinthians 13 _isn’t_ a prerequisite for marriage. If it was, humanity wouldn’t have made it to a second generation. I have never met a person who is always the epitome of 1 Corinthians 13, and if you make 1 Corinthians 13 the basis of your marriage, your marriage will not be stable because your execution of 1 Corinthians 13 will go in and out. Nobody that I know is all of those things all of the time. If your marriage depends on that, it will depend on something that is unstable, and Jesus said the wise man builds his house upon the rock, not the sand. 1 Corinthians 13 is sand. And you’re marriage will collapse when it starts to shift. Let’s get this nonsense out of the church; your marriage depends on the fear of the Lord, not on you choosing to love your wife unconditionally. You say, “It’s a choice. And choices can be stable.” Tell me that the next time you boast about something, or resent someone, or you’re suspicious if someone is telling you the truth. We react in violation of 1 Corinthians 13 from the realms of automated behavior, not from sitting down and making the decision, “I’m going to be irritable today.” You’re headed in the right direction is making marriage depend on a choice rather than a feeling, but … You can’t choose to love someone. You can’t even choose to be affectionate towards someone. You can choose what you respect, and that’s malleable but it’s not liquid. When people violate the things your respect, you disrespect them. Even though you can sort of frame the things you respect to fit a certain person, thereby choosing to respect them, the minute they violate those standards of respect, you no longer respect them. And so because there is a line, and people will cross that line, you do not choose it. The same goes for affections. You have some influence in what you admire about people, but if they violate that, your standard isn’t going to bend far enough to keep them in your affections. You will lose affection for them. And they can always jump back in, and you’ll be affectionate towards them again, but you see how it fluctuates in and out. You shouldn’t choose to be affectionate towards wicked behaviors. And so when people say, “Choose to love your partner,” no, choose to keep them around even when they’ve violated your standards of what you are affectionate towards. Don’t change what you’re affectionate towards so that you are affectionate towards people who do drugs if you find out your wife does drugs. Do you see this? Don’t choose to love her when she acts wickedly. Choose to honor your vow before the Lord even when it would be a sin to love her. Make her your enemy when you have to. It’s not about choosing love, it’s about fearing the Lord. Now, that will maintain the marriage, but it won’t maintain the relationship. Unfortunately, there’s nothing you can do to ensure the relationship will be in this permanent state of bliss. That’s just not reality. Your relationship will fluctuate based on conditions, just like your relationship with God fluctuates based on conditions, but isn’t it good to know that no matter what, you’re still his son? You’re still your wife’s husband? That’s what marriage is supposed to be, a picture of God’s attitude towards us. I personally believe the marriage (literally, the oneness) is the relationship, not the covenant, so I’ll say it this way: the fear of the Lord will maintain the covenant when love will not maintain the marriage. And if the covenant depends on the marriage (the relationship, the oneness), than it will be unstable, and there will always be risk of divorce, because the marriage fluctuates. The relationship fluctuates. The fear of the Lord will maintain the covenant when the marriage won’t. And in the end, you will be better off having a marriage that’s weathered a few challenges and persevered then having this pattern of: marriage, divorce; marriage, divorce; marriage, divorce. I think most of us know this intuitively. It’s just hard in the moment to see the sun beyond the clouds, but the point of fearing the Lord is that you don’t need to see it. You just need to trust God when he says, “It’s there.” “I have made marriage a covenant, because I know what is best. You get so caught up looking at the trees that you miss the forest, but I see the forest, and I’m going to navigate you through this complicated thing called life, and I want you to trust me that I know what I’m doing. You don’t need to understand my directions, you just need to trust them. When I tell you that I hate divorce, I want you to trust me that divorce is your worst option, and it’s going to be better for you listen to me and persevere.”

Sometimes I wonder if we really believe that. Do we believe that God knows what’s best, or do we just thing in terms of, “Okay, God said it, so I’m going to stick with my vow even though it’s the worst possible idea in the world, and it will cause me more grief and pain than if I just divorce.” Why do you think God hates divorce? Just because he’s God? He just does? I think there are things about it that we don’t see that God sees, and if we saw it, we would understand, “Oh, wow, divorce is awful. It’s way better to stick this thing through than to divorce.” I don’t think it’s as shallow as, “Well, you made a vow before me, so you better keep it!” And that would be fine if it was, but I think there’s something deeper. God’s commandments are good. Do we believe that? Do we believe Psalm 119? Or do we just think God’s commandments are ultimate? You see, we will live life very differently if we treat God’s commandments as ultimate versus if we treat them as good. “Well God said no divorce, so I guess I’m stuck.” Or, “God knows what he’s doing, and he says no divorce, and his commandments are good, so divorce is not an option. There is something good at the end of this. There is something good that will come from believing God when he says, ‘No divorce.’” That’s the difference I’m fighting for here. I want us to persevere because we trust God. But that is secondary. That’s not primary. The Bible says, “Fear the Lord.” If for no other reason, you say, “I will obey God because I’m afraid of what he will do to me if I disobey,” that’s the beginning of wisdom. It’s not the end, but it’s the beginning. From that vantage point, I want us to begin to realize, “God’s commandments are actually good.” And you start to trust God instead of only fearing him, and you never lose your fear of him, but you start to see that he’s good, and when that happens, you are a step further towards wisdom. God loves a cheerful giver. Right? Not a giver that says, “Look, God! See? I’m giving away my paycheck. Please don’t hurt me!” That’s the beginning of wisdom, because if all else fails, at least you are making the wise choice. You don’t understand why, but you are following God’s directions, and that’ll get you through the forest. And maybe it’s out of fear, but that’s better than just going your own way and ending up lost. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. But beyond that is when you trust the Lord, and you start to realize, “Oh, he’s taking me somewhere. He’s not just playing a game with me, zapping me with lightning every time I move off the path, he’s trying to guide me out of the forest. It’s going to be good for me if I do what he says.” And so instead of making wise choices because you’re afraid of getting zapped, you make wise choice because you trust God, and that’s a level up in wisdom. When you read Psalm 119, they didn’t camp out at the beginning of wisdom; they moved on to trusting God because they realized that his commandments were good. It shouldn’t be our goal to get the most basic kind of wisdom and then never progress. Psalm 119 should be our goal. We’ve excelled in wisdom such that we trust God when he says, “Do this.” And we do it, not just out of fear, but because we understand that it’s good. Beyond trust, is when God is gracious enough to unveil why you’re doing what you’re doing. When he starts to explain his directions. And so after we get this primary wisdom of, “God’s in charge, so I better listen to him,” we get this secondary wisdom of, “God is actually good and he knows what he’s doing, and it’s going to work out well for me if I trust him.” It’s just like it is with your children. At first, they obey you if they’re wise enough to know, “Dad’s in charge, and I’m going to get a spanking if I disobey him.” That’s the beginning of wisdom, but hopefully that’s not where wisdom ends. You hope that as time goes on, your child begins to understand, “Dad knows best, and if I trust his advice, things are going to work out for me better in the end.” And as your child matures, he starts to understand, “Oh, now I see why we had all these rules.” And they start to see the value of the rules. That’s what we should aspire to in our Christian walk. Hopefully we mature enough to realize, “God’s rules are good.” And so when you see somebody just tossing their marriage under the bus, it disheartens me, because underneath it all, what it says about that person is that they don’t trust God. They don’t’ trust that his commandments are good. More than that, it tells me that they don’t even fear God. They don’t have the most basic kind of wisdom, the fear of the Lord, to stop them from disobeying him. That disheartens me, when I see so many Christians who are babes in Christ, so childish that they haven’t even established the basic kind of wisdom that says, “I’m going to get a spanking if I do this.” The Bible says, “God scourges every son that he recieveth.” But they aren’t afraid of that. They are willing to totally just disregard his commandments, and they don’t have a trembling bone in there body that says, “Wait a minute, there will be consequences for disobeying God.” And we see them, don’t we? How often does divorce make you happy? It doesn’t. You know why? Because God is disciplining you. And because when you don’t obey God, there are natural consequences. Just like when your dad tells you, “Okay son, don’t touch the stove.” You should fear the spanking, but the command was to keep you from burning yourself. Dad is probably not going to spank you in that situation, because getting burned was a punishment in itself. And so sometimes you might be thinking, “Why isn’t God punishing me for getting a divorce?” But are you really unpunished? Maybe the consequence was just natural instead of a divine spanking, and there’s no need to be redundant.

To get back to the point, what role does love play in our romantic inclination towards people? Is it a choice? Why do we get married? Find a girl that fears the Lord. She won’t divorce you, because she fears the Lord. But surely there’s more to is. It says, “She will do good to him and not evil.” The fear of the Lord will not only be a rock for your covenant, it will be an anchor for your relationship. When you fear the Lord, you act with compassion, and other virtues. I say anchor (in contrast to rock), because the relationship will still fluctuate a little, but if it gravitates around the fear of the Lord, it will always come back.

The people who always complain, “There no practical use for math in real life!” I find, are the same people who waste time manually recording information when an excel spreadsheet could to it automatically. The reason it’s not useful to you is because you don’t understand it, and you don’t know the possibilities of what it can do.

I’m more concerned about pleasing God than pleasing women, and he does not like pride.

All of the new translations get everything wrong. You say, “It doesn't affect doctrine.” 40,000 Christian denominations with a statement of faith that says, “We believe the whole Bible,” and you’re going to tell me it doesn’t affect doctrine? 1 John 3:6, it affects _Cardenal_ doctrine. I’ve read these versions, and you can literally make the Bible say anything you want, because there are so many contradictions nobody tries to reconcile them, we just pick our favorite interpretation and go with that. And it’s “exegetical” because we have a verse for it, and a handful of derivative verses that depend on our interpretation of that first verse that we interpreted wrong in the first place. It affects doctrine, my friends. In the Lord vs. for the Lord. You say, “It’s the same Greek word.” Yeah, but we don’t speak Greek, so how do you expect us to know which word he’s actually using?

The argument that if you oppose abortion and don’t personally take steps to feed hungry children is not pro-life, but pro-birth, is nonsense. Is it inconsistent with your fundamental values when you talk somebody out of committing suicide, even if you will never personally see them again? Their life is so jacked up, that they would rather die than keep on breathing, but I don’t know anyone that would say, “If you have a tendency to talk people out of suicide, but then you don’t do anything to help their mental agony, you aren’t advocating life, you’re advocating existence.” Listen, people are murdered every single day. I don’t personally care for any of them individually, because I don’t know them. But I care about people, and I’m still going to say murder is wrong. Plus, who’s going to be the judge of how scewed up a person’s life would have been if nobody murdered them? I need to diagram this argument. I’m being way to inarticulate. But my point is that it isn’t inconsistent to oppose murder even if you don’t do anything to help the individuals achieve a higher quality of life. Even if I let someone die from hunger, I would oppose any person who would murder them. The reason that sounds like hypocrisy to you is because you think the underlying issue with murder is death. That’s not the underlying issue. Everybody dies. Every person’s  days are numbered on this earth. The issue isn’t that a person dies. There’s nothing we can do about that. The question is how did they die, and when did they die. That’s the issue with murder. If those two things didn’t matter, murder wouldn’t be wrong. “Well, it was going to happen anyway. Who cares how, and who cares when?” How and when are everything that’s wrong with it. _That_ death happens isn’t the point. Death always happens. Always. How and when is the point. And if I’m opposing people murdering their babies, sacrificing their children to the god of their stomachs, it is not hypocrisy when I don’t tend the tree that I didn’t plant. Because what I’m opposing isn’t death. We all die. I can’t oppose death. What I’m opposing is how they die, and that’s always what we oppose when we oppose murder. Don’t pretend like it isn’t. That being said, I do have a huge burden for the hungry, and I think it’s wrong when Christians let religion become impure and defiled by neglecting to care for the widow and the orphan. But using that as an argument for hypocrisy, so that you can justify yourself in saying, “We’re the same. You just let them die after they’re born, I let them die before they’re born,” is nonsense. We’re not the same, and the reason isn’t because death happens either way, the reason is because of how death happens. “Well, I would rather be killed in the womb than be born, suffer a long while, and die from starvation.” But that’s not your decision to make. Nobody can judge how a person’s life will turn out. And nobody uses that logic with murdering people outside the womb. “That low-life bum was just going to starve to death anyway. It’s perfectly fine that I shot him in the head. He suffered less because of me. Aren’t I a nice person?” If you actually believe that, I would like to personally extend an invitation for a lengthy conversation with you. Because I think I can help you to see how that is inconsistent, probably, with your own moral principles. ---Where do these topics come from? Haha. I have no idea how I get myself into writing these paragraphs every day. This one was from a YouTube video by Apologia Studios.

You get the prize of my respect! Let me tell you something about respect. If you have a choice between getting respect, and a marshmallow, let’s say a whole bag of marshmallows, choose respect. You say, “Why choose respect?” Let me tell you why: … Oh, look! Your teacher is here to rescue you from me. Give yourselves a round of applaus, boys and girls, you did a great job babysitting me. – we were like 8 and you’re already, “Don't get any ideas mister, cause I know I'm just so irresistible, but try to refrain anyway cause I'm not interested.” Haha! “This is an exclusively platonic relationship.” High opinion of yourself much? I just remember feeling awkward, like, “What did Deborah tell you?” She had this habit of telling people that I wanted to marry. And she legitimately thought she was correct, but she never actually ran it by me to confirm. So I would would just change the subject, or depersonalize it. I was like, “Well, criteria is: not younger. So my brother Caleb would be eligible, then? Yes?” just trying to make as intellectual and analytical as I could, cause I couldn't have you thinking that I wanted to marry you. Oh, good times. I don't think I did want to marry you. You were a year older than me. That would be like banging a grandma.

What I learned in distance learning classes is that everybody is like sheep. Somebody says something, and everyone follows suit. Then I say something, and everyone changes their minds. They think they’re independently drawing their own conclusions, but they’re not. What’s happening is somebody persuades them about one point of view, and confirmation bias sets in, and suddenly they make their own arguments in light of what they’ve been pursuaded about. Then someone persuades them of another viewpoint, and confirmation bias happens all over again. It’s the funniest thing, and I’ve documented the dynamic of these discussion posts because I thought they were very interesting.

Father, every day you provide the food our bodies need to be sustained. I pray that you would open our eyes to your rich generosity, that we would have thankful hearts for what you give us every day. We thank you for the days that we have sun shine, and we thank you for the days we have rain.

Fornication is sinful not because sex is sinful, but because sex is holy. Sex is set apart and intended for a specific purpose by God, between one man, one women, in one lifetime, in one marriage bed. That’s what holy means. Holy means it has an intended purpose for a specific thing, and when you use it for something else, it violates holiness. It becomes defiled. Defilement is when you use something for a purpose it wasn’t intended for. When I take a milk jug and use a ehat gun on it to forge something else, it defiles the milk jug. That’s a good form of defilement, because it becomes more useful for something else. But that’s what defilement means. You defile something when you use it for your own purposes instead for the purpose it was designed for. That’s not what we think of when we use the word, “Defile.” We think of, “You defiled her. You raped her.” But what does that mean? It means she was meant for something better than what you just did to her.

I think Paul erred in that whole situation in [Acts 16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+16%3A37-39&version=KJV) where he demands nominal compensatory damages for having been wrongfully beaten. Because I read through Acts one time in light of [Romans 7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7%3A15&version=KJV), where Paul talks about being carnal, and he says, “For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.” And I thought, “When does Paul do what he doesn’t allow?” And I read through Acts, and I found a couple of places, and chapter 16 was one of them. Because he says in [1 Corinthians 6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+6%3A7&version=KJV), “Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?” So he’s not allowing the brethren to seek compensatory damages among themselves, when he himself demanded it from the Roman magistrates. So we see that that’s something he doesn’t allow, but he did the very thing which he allows not, and that’s exactly what he says in Romans 7. So I don’t think that’s justification for the Wilber Force Persecution Relief. Jesus said I have not come to bring peace, but a sword, and brother will turn in brother. He said, “If the world hated me, it will hate you also.” And James says, “Friendship with the world is enmity with God.” We shouldn’t be wasting our time trying to legislation a persecutions world. We should be out there winning souls to the Lord. Should we obey God or men? “Well we’re not allowed to do it, and God says to obey the government, so the clear answer is to get laws changed.” That man in Elijah’s story had permission from the law, and they persecuted him anyway. Our goal isn’t making the world treat us well. Our goal is saving those who are perishing. The world is passing away. Let’s not worry about making them treat us nicely, let’s get their souls saved.

I like linear hair. We are no longer to be children, tossed to and fro by waves. Let’s keep things straight. (I might be stretching that passage a bit much.)

The thing about having a speck in your eye, when you have a speck in your eye, it’s very irritating. Right? You just want it out. You should want to help people get the specks out of their eyes. The only thing is, if you have a plank in your eye, it’s, “Ahh! Oh! Hold on a second, I’ve got to get this out of my own eye first.” Right? Because if I have a little wood chipping in you eye, I’m going be more focused on getting that out so I can see clearly to help my buddy. Jesus isn’t saying we shouldn’t help people get sin out of their lives, he’s saying we should get it out of our own lives first so that we can see clearly to help others.

What ultimately changed my mind about the KJV was not specific anecdote examples of where other translations erred, because I thought, “That’s just a few outlier examples.” What ultimately change my mind was reading it, and getting a general sense of awe, that, “This is God’s word.” It was this inexplainable overarching power that radiated the glory of God and made me confess, “Those other translations are watered down.” It wasn’t even the doctrinal variances that begged me to switch. It was the passages that say the same thing, but one of them has power, and the other doesn’t. It’s like this: someone gets on stage, and let’s say they both say the exact same words, but one of them is charismatic, and synergistic, and says it with authority and zeal, and the other guy sort of mumbles and says everything timidly. Right? One of them was more powerful. But obviously it’s not due to tones and voices and energy, it’s due to syntax. One of them is just written more powerfully. I think of it like ThugNotes on TV. That guy is good for a laugh, but if you want to feel Shakespeare, you can’t study it through the vernacular of thug. “And ya boy was like, ‘Yo dawg, what’s sizzling?’” You can get the jist of the stories, he preserves it, but you don’t experience it in the least. He can help you study for a quiz, but what he can’t do is be a shortcut for you to experience, and feel, and resonate with the story. That’s the way these new translations are. They preserve 90 some percent of the Bible, and you might think, “Well, I can just be careful and know the specific places where it’s wrong, and I’ll be aware of them.” But even if it preserved the whole thing, I would still read the KJV because you do not experience the power of God’s word in those other translations. They are the ThugNotes version, the, “Let me dumb this down for you to make it more amusing.” The Bible isn’t meant to be amusing, it’s meant to be musing. And so ultimately it was the self-authenticating qualities of the KJV that convicted me, “This is the word of God.” And someone is going to say, “Well that’s the way I felt with the NLT!” But that’s just a talking point. That’s exactly what I wouldn’t said before I switched, but I would have said it because it makes a good argument and you can’t disprove it, not because it was true. It’s just a talking point. It’s like when somebody brings up rape in a discussion of the ethics of abortion. They aren’t really interesting in having an honest discussion, they just want to be right, so they try making a case for the oitlier anecdote, and use that to transpose their argument into an overarching generalization that extends to all circumstances. The truth is, though, I don’t agree with murdering babies just because the mother didn’t consent to having sex. If somebody runs by me, and drops a baby in my lap, I’m not going to say, “Well, I certainly didn’t ask for this. Sorry kid.” And pull out a knife and stab it to death. Rape doesn’t make murder okay. That’s common sense. But for some reason, this mentally challenged leftists think it makes a good argument. It’s just a talking point. (I used to think non sequitter had the definition of talking point).

For inspiration in the video and rhetorical aspects of amplify ministries, look up the videos I’ve liked on youtube by SciShow, specifically with the fellow who has a blond highlight in his hair. Game Theory may provide useful insights into my labor project, because of axioms such as Nash ______. I would very much like to explore how the brain works, and SciShow would be an excellent source of information collection, because they explain how conclusions were derived at, allowing the viewer to propound alternative explinations. Competing ideas essential in the process of science, and therefore I would be interesting in collecting data and propounding my personal explinations in light of the Bible, dualism, and how it relates to the brain. Who knows what I will find. The world needs to be parented. In marriage, in science, in health, in life.

In rear-end collisions, most anecdote cases involve negligence on the driver who crashed into the car, not the driver who stopped. This is because there is more freedom to prevent a car crash by driving a safe distance away, as opposed to determining what an inaproprate deceleration value might be. There are [four](http://www.sdt.com.au/safedrive-directory-STOPPINGDISTANCE.htm) considerations you should consider when you stop your vehicle, and when you’re following a vehicle: (1) Human Perception Time, (2) Human Reaction Time, (3) Vehicle Reaction Time, (4) Vehicle Braking Capability. There’s a lot more you can do with distance than with speed, and therefore the burden is generally passed to the rear driver. I.e.,

What might be good forensics? The driver of the vehicle that is responsible for the collision has to provide evidence that the vehicle she crashed into stopped recklessly, or changed lanes abruptly. Are there any skid marks that the tire left? Were there screeched? Because the only obvious fact is that you ran into the front driver. The question is, was the accident caused by negligence (or recklessness) by the rear driver, or was it caused by negligence (or recklessness) by the front diver in stopping abruptly? The natural assumption in the absence of evidence is that the rear driver was tailing the front driver to closely. In order to get our drivers license, we all know that it doesn’t take long for the car in front of us to stop. It takes longer for us to stop, because there is perception time, reaction time, vehicle reaction time, and braking capability. We all know better then to drive to closely to the car in front of us, and yet, on any given day, if you were to look a car driving behind another car, and count how long it takes the rear car to reach a reference point that the front car just passed, you’ll find that it is not uncommon at all for people to disobey that 2 second rule. Most people trail more closely than they learned was safe in Drivers Ed. On the other hand, what did we learn about stopping in Drivers Ed? There’s no 2 second rule for that. 2 seconds is law, and 4 seconds is responsible. When you think about it, most people stop pretty quickly. It takes about 4.6 seconds for a car to stop. In driver’s ed, we learn to drive following rules that safeguard us against worst-case scenarios. There’s a lot more you can do about driving a safe distance behind someone then realizing too late, “That’s a stop sign!” We also learn to stop at a [decent acceleration](http://nacto.org/docs/usdg/vehicle_stopping_distance_and_time_upenn.pdf). The projected safety distance is 302 feet (for 60 mph), well over double most vehicles published road braking performances (between 120-140 feet). Most people don’t follow that rule either. So it’s anyone’s guess whose fault it is. Personally, I would shift the blame to the rear driver. If a car can stop in 4.6 seconds, you should drive with worst case scenarios in mind. The reason I say that is because the collision might have happened or not based on a reaction by the rear driver, versus the front driver doesn’t react to anything. He just stops. There’s nothing he can do about the driver behind him. If you’re 2 seconds behind a car, and the car in front of you begins to stop, and in 4.6 seconds she is completely stopped, you have 6.6 seconds to stop your vehicle. Are you going to tell me it took you 2 full seconds to start braking?

We haven’t figured out the problem, but we’ve figured out a solution. Rollar Coaster Tycoon wouldn’t load Faith’s file. We couldn’t figure out why. But we were able to load a different file and then from there we would go back and load her original game. We basically found a loophole around the problem instead of finding a solution to the problem.

You can extrapolate beckwards and say, “Does the behavior make sense without _mens rea_?” That’s what Beyond A Reasonable Doubt means: are there any explinations for the facts that make sense that don’t necessitate a the crime?

Why do you think the serpent went to Eve instead of going to Adam? Because Adam was there when God made stuff, right? Plus, women are the weaker vessel, in body and mind according to the Bible, and according to science. Right? Because women naturally have a lot more oxytocin than men, and what is oxytocin? It make inclines you to trust people. They did a study where the occupants had to trust people with their money, and they snuck oxytocin in people’s drinks, and the one’s who drank it were more likely to trust people. Women naturally have that inclination to be open to new ideas, whereas men are more stable, less open to suggestion, and more skeptical. Now, of course both men and women can overcome their natural inclinations; we’re just talking about how we’re wired, or programmed, if you will. (What effect does the brain have on the mind anyway? Clearly it is reciprocal, if phenomena in the brain affect decision-making). Theology aside, it doesn’t take a scientific study to point out the superior abilities men have compared to women. However, since saying things of that nature is so politically incorrect, facts that have been confirmed by mainstream science might be necessary to keep conversations cordial and objective.[[1]](#_ftn1) What you do with these facts are up to you. Isn’t it interesting that the Bible is filled with commands to men about lust, but there isn’t one command towards women about it? It’s because men and women are different. Everywhere you look, people are saying that men are not more emotionally stable than women.[[2]](#_ftn2) Yet those same studies admit that we control it better. Now they say the reason is culture, how they were raised, how society teaches them to behave, but I’m inclined to believe there’s something intrinsic about it. The Bible says women are the weaker vessel.[[3]](#_ftn3) Ecclesiastes says, “I found one upright man among a thousand, but not one upright woman among them all.” Sure enough, if you read through Kings and Chronicles, every woman leader was wicked in God’s sight. A bunch of the men were too. But many of them, especially in the line of Judah, did what was right in God’s sight. Women should keep silence in churches. Why? Because Satan went to Eve, not to Adam. That’s the reason given, but I think its hinting at a more fundamental reality, namely, the reasons Satan went to the woman as opposed to the man. Based on the differences in their way of thinking, and interacting with new ideas, and new people. Dinah went to meet the madens and ended up having sex with the most honorable fellow in that city (I mention honor because I don’t think it was rape, for that reason). Interesting. Potiphar’s wife tried getting Joseph under the sheets, and when she couldn’t she framed him. Jerk. Lot’s daughters took seed from their father. Their father! That’s just disgusting. Michael despised David because of his humility. Sarah told Abraham to sleep with her maid and then blamed him for it. Job’s wife told him to curse God and die. Moses’ wife was a nagging women, who said he only brought trouble to their house. Better to live on the corner of a roof then to share a house with a quarrelsome wife. Ahab’s wife enticed him to all kinds of evil. Solomon’s wives ushered in false gods into Israel. Phillip’s wife married his brother Hared, and had John the Baptist killed because he said it wasn’t legal. Paul looked at all of that and said, “Things work out better when women obey God’s punishment of making them submit to men.” Who are the women heroes of the Bible? Ruth, Ester, Rahab, Proverbs 31. What’s the common denominator? They all feared the Lord. It wasn’t submission to men that made them great, it was submission to God that made them great. Women don’t have as much self-control as men. They’re more reactive, they don’t have temperance, and God says they need to play the part of a women and submit to their husbands, because the very first thing that ushered sin into this world was when a woman played the part of her husband, and took the fruit, and gave it to Adam. Men should be emotionally stronger than women, because – does God ever define effeminacy? Because Paul says effeminacy is a sin. Paul talks about wives tales, and gossip.

“When did I say that?” You made some pretty unequivocal implications when you said you don’t like your extended family because they’re snobby and stuck up. It’s not uncommon that I unfortunately share those same qualities in class, and if those qualities are the reason you don’t like them, and I have those qualities, you do the math. I’m on your shitlist. [Gasp]. Oh I’m sorry. Everybody has a separation of sheep and goats, and there are people you accept and trust and admire, and people you don’t care for, and avoid, and reject. I think it’s easier, and I would even say more understandable, to just use the word “shitlist” than go through all of that. If you know anything about Fayman's law, simplicity is valued over complexity when it comes to communication skills. So when you downplay people for using simplistic rhetoric, you're displaying your ignorance of what it means to be an effective communicator. Personally, these kinds of four-letter words irritate me when they are used, but I think that’s because I was conditioned that way, not because there’s something intrinsically irritating about it. It’s a sound. Someone in another language won’t be offended by it. The reason anybody gets offended by it is because they were taught to be offended by it (even when the person didn’t mean any offense). They were taught it means something, that it’s a curse, when really people are just using it to communicate ideas. Personally, I prefer to use more impressive rhetoric because I like to sound intelligent. But that is my pride getting in the way of good functionality. That’s my pride disobeying Fayman’s law, when he has shown very compellingly that it’s best to explain things in the simplest terms that you can. But no, I just want to impress people with my impressive vocabulary. That’s sin, not intelligence. Intelligence has the intelligence to know, “Words are only meaningful if people can understand them.” So while I can win arguments with longer words, they might walk away in defeat, still clueless as to why they were wrong, or if they were wrong.

I think of sin kind of like sneezing. Once the dust is up your nose, there’s not much you can do about it. I thought about this one time when I sneezed early in the morning, and somebody woke up upset with me, and I said, “Forgive me.” And I thought, “You know, I did not make the decision to sneeze, but I’m still responsible for it. If it caused damage to anybody, that’s on me whether I made the choice to sneeze or not.” You say, “Well that’s not fair,” but it really is perfect justice. You see, what we can’t do is make ourselves not sneeze. We are creatures of flesh with certain mechanisms that kick in and override any conscious commands we might have used to stop it. “Don’t sneeze, don’t sneeze, don’t sneeze. …AH CHOO.” “Don’t lust, don’t lust, don’t lust. *Erection.*” What can we do about it? I can discipline my body as much as I want, I can beat my body to keep it under subjection, I can go 3 minutes with an itch until my skin has a numbing feeling. I know what self-control is, and I know what it is to resist urges. Porn addiction is a completely different thing. So what can we do? You see, no matter how much discipline you build up, you cannot stop yourself from sneezing. That’s not a choice you can make. You are a slave to your body in that sense. But what you can do it dust your house every week. You can resist the temptation to put pepper up to your nose. That is a choice that is very much in your hands. And when you look at the Bible, it’s full of commands to avoid these kinds of sins. These gateway sins. “Can a man hold a burning coal up to his chest without getting burned?” You do not choose to get burned, but you do choose whether or not to handle the coal. You do not choose lust, but you choose where you go, and what you allow yourself to search in google. You can guard yourself and arm yourself with scripture so that when you see an advertisement or a billboard, you say, “Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity and quicken thou me in thy way,” and you turn away your eyes from seeing evil. You can identify all kinds of triggers and gouge them out of your life. Maybe TV, maybe Facebook, maybe your homework that you do online, and sometimes there’s something that triggers that sneeze response of lust in you. The Bible says, “Guard your heart with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of life.” It’s this image of setting a watchman over your heart, and every time he sees an enemy, he blows the trumpet and you prepare a defense. God has given us his word as a sword, and too many Christians go to bed without blood on it. There is a spiritual war going on every single day, because in Hebrews the Writer says the sin’s deceit is every day. If we think we can mosey on through without a weapon, we’re fooling ourselves. The battle isn’t fought at the moment when you have that powerful urge to look at porn, that gravity that pulls you towards it. Maybe 2 out of 7 times you can keep yourself from sneezing at that point. But the main place that you fight the battle is by keeping yourself on guard. By avoiding those gateway sins. By not allowing your imagination to put yourself in the place of the protagonist on that TV show you like who’s constantly fornicating with his girlfriend. You keep that away from you, and you keep your thoughts pure. And when you have a thought in your mind that defiles holiness, you challenge it and don’t allow it to manifest itself in temptation. Once it leads to an urge, and your body starts to prepare for sex, it’s a biological mechanism like sneezing at that point. What you sneeze to do is keep your house dusted and your nose away rom the pepper. That’s how you’re going to overcome sin. Not by saying, “Don’t lust, don’t lust, don’t lust. … What is wrong with you?” You’re living in a body of death, that’s what’s wrong with you.

It may be better for me to listen to old prayers than to offer you new ones.

Faith came upstairs one time and asked, “Do you want to explain something to me at 4 O’clock?” She knows I do things by a schedule. I overheard her downstairs saying, “Ethan is a good explainer. I understand everything perfectly.” This was a day after I explained what Beyond A Reasonable Doubt mean using a situation where I found my water bottle by her, and my job as plaintiff was to ask if there are any reasonable explanations to explain the facts without a mens rea and an actus rea (guilty mind and guilty act—the two elements of a crime, which she later explained to Brian in front of the family). “For example, if I said, ‘I have an explanation—aliens!’ That wouldn’t be very reasonable. But I could say, ‘Well, Ethan was sitting right next to faith, and he put his water bottle down pretty close to her,’ that would be reasonable. Right? Because nobody actually saw you take the water bottle. But we have 4 eye witnesses that the water bottle was at your spot. That’s our fact: the water bottle was at Faith’s spot. The allegation that I have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that you stole it, and the way I prove it to that standard is I say, “There are no explanations that make sense to explain the fact without Faith having done the act (actus rea) and meant to (mens rea).”

I’m not interested in dolls, but I’m interested in my little sister, and she’s interested in dolls, so I’m interested in dolls.

Ruth folded the corner of the blanket of Boaz’s feet, that day’s equivalent of, “Hint, hint, nudge, nudge.” What women need to understand is that Ruth didn’t wait around for Boaz. He obviously liked her, but he wasn’t taking initiative, so Naomi got proactive and said, “Listen girlfriend, you’ve got take steps to make things happen.” How do women do that today? You grab him by the ear and say, “Hey stupid, I like you.” Boaz never asked Ruth to marry him. He never communicated his affections to her in a revealing way. They are like the star couple of the Bible, and Ruth asked him out. Imagine that. And their offspring became the most important people in the Bible. David came from them, the whole line of the rulers of Judah came from them. Jesus came from them. All of that was on the line, and it depended on Ruth folding the blanket over Boaz’s feet. Don’t be afraid to approach a man before he approaches you. Amazing things can happen when you ask him.

It’s not going to matter how persuasive you are, how seductive you are, how beautiful you look that day, or what time you ask him. He’s either interested in you, or he’s not. The growth depends on the soil, not how much you doctor up the seed. You’re either compatible or you’re not, but you’re not doing anybody any favors by waiting around thinking, “Maybe he’ll ask me.” Maybe he won’t. Get to work.

Honestly, when I read the story of Ruth, this beautiful narrative of love and marriage, I don’t come out of those four chapters thinking, “I want to find my Ruth.” I think I would prefer Naomi. Ruth is loyal, and beautiful, and has a good heart, but let’s face it, Naomi is a crafty little woman, sly dawg that she is. She gets creative. She has ideas. She’s bold. She just sounds like a more interesting person to share a life with, even if it’s just those golden years. You say, “She was a widow.” So was Ruth.

Bringing in Strobel and other apologists was entirely inappropriate to the case. From a legal standpoint, to pass the lemon test (thereby violating the establishment clause), the plaintiff’s allegation would have to charge her with teaching Christian doctrines, not merely talking about textual references in historic literature. Trying to prove Christianity is historically fact is closer to an establishment of religion that citing text in the Bible. The Iliad doesn’t need to be fact for a teacher to say, “In the Iliad, such and such is written.” What makes it violate the establishment clause is if she says, “The Iliad is true.” Right? If I say, “The Bible says XYZ,” that’s perfectly fine. That’s very testable claim. It’s a question of literature, not a question of doctrine. What makes it an establishment of religion is when the teacher says, “XYZ is true, because the Bible says it.” Do you see the difference here? It’s the same difference known as Divine Inspiration in Christian doctrine. We  believe everything the Bible says is true, but sometimes the Bible records what people say. If we read through Job, many things his friends say isn’t true, yet we say we believe the whole Bible. How can this be? Because we believe the Bible records what people say, and what people say isn’t necessarily true. The same principle applies in school. I can say the Bible says something, but what I can’t do is say it is therefore true. It is true that the Bible says that, and that’s where restrictions apply. But to be honest, I say let’s go all the way. “Jesus was the most influential person in history. How can you teach history without Jesus?” Isn’t it an establishment of religion to teach Jesus? Then again, isn’t it an establishment of religion not to? We say, “If it offends someone, we can’t teach it in school, whether it’s fact or not.” If that were true, the “science must die” movement in Africa would’ve crept into America. It’s offensive to women that they produce 20 times less testosterone then men, they have 30 – 40% less muscle mass than men, and they feel twice as much pain do to more sensitive nerves. That might be offensive, it might even contradict somebody’s belief system, but we teach it in school anyway, and do you know why? Because it is fact. Why don’t we treat religion like everything else and put them all to the test, and challenge people? What’s so bad about that? Search through history and you’ll discover the answer. We may be in a rational world, but there will never be enough rationality to confront mindless faith. When it comes to matters of religion, people don’t use the same standards of reason that they would in any other aspect of life. Why? Indoctrination. And that’s what these schools are doing. They aren’t educating kids, they’re indoctrinating them. That’s the true establishment of religion, and it’s already swept across the nation. -- But it did set rise to one question: why not? Why not put religion to the test? I mean, people are entitled to believe whatever they want, but if it’s religious we can’t teach it in the school systems? The reason Christianity should be allowed is if it passes the highest standards of textual criticism. No other religion has the evidence that Christianity has. – My point is that if they need to prove that XYZ is true for the teacher to say, “The Bible says XYZ,” they are overlooking the point of the establishment clause. Whether XYZ is true or not, the teacher’s statement is true. It’s a simple reference to a piece of literature. That’s not what teaching doctrine is. If I need my children to not hear the Koran, what does that say about me? That says I’m unwilling to let them hear the arguments, and I need them to not think for themselves because I want to dictate their beliefs. That sounds like a self-refutation in light of the allegation that was posed in the plaintiff’s complaint. If the allegation was, “The teacher said the Bible says XYZ,” than the Jury would have to find her guilty, and the judge would have to let her go, because there is no law against that. She’s guilty as charged, and there’s no consequence for it. On the other hand, if the allegation says, “The teacher said XYZ,” than the jury would have to find her innocent, because the facts are not consistent with the allegation. If they found her guilty, she would face consequences. But she’s not guilty of that. Since that’s the issue in question, proving XYZ is true is completely irrelevant to the case. Even if it is true, if the teacher said it in class, than it’s an establishment of religion, because there’s a religion that revolves around those facts. Then again, the same could be said for biology. Some people take certain facts, and make religions out of them (cults really), but it doesn’t make it an establishment of religion to teach those facts. Why? Because you derived those facts independently of the religion. The religion actually was derived from the facts, not the facts from the religion. Otherwise if I didn’t like some teaching in school, I could just make a religion based on it, and claim, “Establishment of religion” when the teacher teaches physics. “I worship gravity. You’re not allowed to teach it in school.” Be that as it may, your religion is a derivative of the facts, not the other way around. Do you see the problem here? And so I suppose it could be a reasonable case to say, “XYZ is true,” but that’s only relivant if the teacher explained it independently of the religion, rather than based on the religion. In patent law, you can’t make a patent for something that is obvious, something that people might have thought of independently of ever seeing it first. The same standards should apply to education and the facts involved with society’s pursuit of knowledge. If facts happen to be entagled with other religion, it doesn’t bear any relevance to whether it should be taught or not. If it’s true, it should be taught. If the evidence isn’t compelling, it should not be taught. But merely saying, “This piece of literature says XYZ,” is true. And therefore it does not imfringe the establishment clause, unless the teacher mususes it to constantly give subliminal insights into a particular religion. You might say she is using her freedom as a loophole to indoctrinate these kids by saterating them in biblical teachings, even though you don’t say, “The Bible is true.” If you hear it enough, you’ll start to believe it. That’s the premise that you have to provide evidence for. So I have two things: (1) Strobel was irrelevant from a legal standpoint (because the matter of fact isn’t whether XYZ is true, but whether the Bible says XYZ—and if XYZ being true makes it okay, then we’ve justified her by establishing a religion on the basis of it being true, which is unconstitutional, true or not), (2), if you’re going to fight for XYZ, then it should be fought for in the board of education, not a courtroom.

Just because the FDA doesn’t always do what’s popular doesn’t mean it’s automatically a puppet of lobyiests. The reason we live in a republic rather than a direct democracy is to safeguard people from unchecked popular opinion—and that is exactly what these new health fads are: unchecked. They need to be researched by people that know what they’re talking about, not by people who don’t evidently even know the difference between an organism and a cell. We give people grants. Fight for that instead of passing bills that fly in the face of what mainstream science is uncovering. The reason we are in a republic is because we value truth above popular opinion, in conjunction with freedom to believe whatever you want. We legislate based on facts, not raw opinion, because popular opinion is not always the correct ones. I’m not a proponent of just trusting “experts,” and they need to be checked as well, but that’s what we mean when we’re talking about the “scientific community.” If you want to keep them in check, become a scientist, of appoint someone that you trust to be engaged with the scientific community. Don’t just trust these independent researchers outside of mainstream science. The reason we have laws that don’t allow raw milk to be sold off the farm is to safeguard us from popular opinion, so that we don’t get sick. Why? Because illness doesn’t give a crap about popular opinion, it depends on things that are true. That’s why I say the FDA is not a puppet of the people, it’s a puppet of science (I should say, scientists). The way to fight it is not with politics, but with argumentation. Get involved in mainstream research. Learn proper ways of doing things. Because frankly, I don’t even trust mainstream people without Fayman-standard explanations. I certainly don’t trust independent researchers who never provide textbook-level research. And they can sway opinions very easily—I’ve seen it. But as a student of biology, I had insights that all the women (yes, I was the only man there besides my dad) didn’t, and the researchers couldn’t provide evidence to conform with scientific scrutiny. The milk that we acquired from the lady off-the-farm regularly got sour (which offsets you from milk for quite a while, let me tell you). But in my house, there wasn’t an alternative. Now I don’t think I can drink milk without smelling it first, but after so many gross surprises, milk always smells bad to me now, so it’s hard to tell. And here’s the kicker: the people in this community say, “That’s okay, milk is actually good for you as it’s starting to go bad. I read something about that—something to do with proteins that are forming.” There is a reason Paul said we are to have nothing to do with wives tales—because wives will believe anything if the writer uses good enough rhetoric. It astonishes me how these women fail to use critical thinking in analyzing these so-called “studies.” It’s as though if it’s in a study, it’s therefore true. That’s an argument from authority. And most of these studies are conducted by independent researchers (i.e. anyone who has an internet connection and a word processing software). I’m glad we have these women, I think we should be open to researching these absurd claims, but we should not legislate in conformity with an independent researcher. If they are compelling, let them get a grant. Don’t skip fact-checking and assert that the FDA has at heart the interests of people who make money off of our sickness. That conspiracy exists in your imagination, and you have zero evidence for it. It just makes sense to you. And if that’s the way you come to conclusions, by what makes sense to you (rather than what you’ve tested, and set up positive and negative control groups, and determined something to have predictive capability), than I certainly don’t want you to spearhead a revolution in everything we know about health. Blaming FDA on those grounds discredits you as a faithful researcher. That’s the self-defeating nature of these fads. They can sway multitudes, but it doesn’t make them correct. I am glad to live in a republic, where experts who know what they’re doing (and are malleable—you can’t blame lack of legislation on inertia) are in charge of the ship. Sophocles was quite right to have concerns with popular opinion, even (and especially) in this age of information (and false information). You see, no matter how “educated” we get, and how informationally literate we get, information will never be what determines education. Critical thinking is. Objective analysis is. What people do with information, and how they test it is what determines a person’s qualifications to have a say in the matter, not raw unchecked information. So people who say, “We have the internet, we should throw out the electoral college! Everything should be direct democracy!” are frankly stupid. That kind of government will be the undoing of great nations, and an enemy of truth, which I hope is important to all of us. Because no matter how much information we can acquire, it will not magically make laymen good scientists. The saying goes, “You can prove anything on the internet.” How do we feel that more false information was reported during the 2016 election than accurate information? That’s astonishing. A republic is the only thing that stands in the way of being governed by the throws of persuasive false information. Thank God for the republic of the United States. More than that, thank God for the revelation of his word. I know it's frustrating to not be involved with FDA policy, and you think you’re so smart and know all the science, and you can “prove” (using that word shows how naive you are) all the “science” behind your fads, but these claims cannot be legislated unchecked or we will have a disaster on our hands. No, reading articles online does not make you well-versed and scientifically literate enough to tell the FDA how they should regulate health standards. You want to make a difference? Send people off into the scientific community who will look into the absurd claims you are making. Let it be tested. “They’re all brainwashed!” If that’s you’re argument, youa re truly hopeless. Our brains need to be washed. That’s the point of doing it the right way instead doing it independently: credibility. You learn objective standards, and the reason people conform to them is because they make sense, and suddenly you go, “Wow, I’ve been doing things fallaciously.” Personally I think evolution is stupid, but that’s based on what has been published within the scientific community, not what I read on ICR.com. The point of a republic is that I have a say in who gets the job of determining what stays in the educational system. We can elect people to go into the system, do things the right way, and fight it from the inside out. That’s how we do things in a republic. Not with debates, not with pushing House Bills. We elect people not to voice our opinions, but to test them. To scrutinize them, and if they check out, they legislate them. If representatives are nothing but the voices of popular opinions, than we live in a direct democracy with distorted numbers, and that’s all. But that’s not what a republic is. The point is, we elect people we trust to take our opinions seriously, and look at it objectively, and see if it’s true in conformity with the standards of mainstream science. Then it will have credibility. We do have influence, friends. But our influence is subject to truth, and that is a wonderful, wonderful thing. If we are so sure about our opinions, we shouldn’t be worried that they won’t stand the test of objective research. We should want them to be tested.

She thinks I’m testing her, but really I’m vindicating myself to her, because trust isn’t that intergral in turning a man on, but it is absolutely necessary in turning a women on. I don’t need to trust her to get into her pants, I need her to trust me. And that was a reverse euphemism, I meant something like, “To get her to have a close relationship with me.” Or to access the vulnerable parts of her. Women can be manipulated this way. That’s the the Bible says, “Charm is deceitful.”

Paul says, “I therefore so run, not as uncertainly, so fight I, not as one that beateth the air.” Wait a minute, I thought it was, “Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall”? Which is it? Do you run certainly, or do you take heed lest you fall? Because you sound pretty sure of victory here (I intentionally avoided saying, “Sure of yourself,” because the passage indicates he boasts in Christ strength being manifest in his weakness, that he gets victory because of Christ). “Come at me temptation! I’m going to crush you!” or, “Temptation may be coming today. Set a guard in the watchtower and ready the defenses”? Which is it?

“Keep his virgin (1 Cor. 7:37)? _His_ virgin? She belongs to him? Is this an expound-ment on the former charge, “Let them who are married be as though they were not (if he has power over his will)”? Marriage, then, is the oneness, not the covenant. “But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none.” Wait a minute, I thought you just said, “Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency”? But notice the former verse: them that have wives. Why not, “Them that are married?” Having a wife is not the same thing as marriage. She is your wife by covenant, but she is your flesh by marriage. A covenant doesn’t make people one. Sex does (1 Cor. 6). Just like salvation doesn’t make you have good fellowship with your Father; drawing near does. “He which is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.” What is this joining? Is it salvation? Or is it, “Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone ehars my voice, and opends the door, I will come in to him, and dine with him, and he with me.” It’s actively seeking the Lord’s presence that makes us one with him, in the full John 17 sense. Sure, we’re a son of God the minute we are saved, but sons and fathers can have an exclusive disciplinary relationship if the son is unprincipled. The Bible says God scourgeth every son that he recieveth. Right? Sometimes you say, “He favors this son. He’s closer to this son.” Which son did what his father wanted to, the son that said he would and ddn’t, or the son that said he wouldn’t and did? There is favoritism, not partiality. We get closer to God by getting closer to God, not by living in sin. Right? There’s two things to the whole counsel of God: What’s necessary, and what’s profitable. The covenant is what’s analogous to what’s necessary, and the marriage is what’s analogous to what’s profitable. (And what’s profitable? Don’t worry. You don’t need to live perfectly to do what’s profitable in repentance towards God. Repentance towards God is sanctification, not glorification. That means it isn’t about where you are, it’s about what direction you’re headed. You can’t change your life in one day, but you can change the direction of your life, the trajectory that you’re on. That’s repentance towards God. That’s why is says _towards_ God. It’s the same issue of proficiency versus growth in the educational systems. It’s about you achieving the maximum proficiency that you can in growth, not some arbitrary standard of proficiency defined by a board of education.) “The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth;” Is the binding of the law marriage? But the man was one with his wife before the law, bound by another law, the law of biology. The binding of the law makes them bound not to each other, but to their vows. “but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will.” Think about this. If she dies, she is no longer married, and no longer bound by covenant to the person she was married to. She no longer has that relationship. But at the same time, she still might be one with him in a nostalgic sense. I mean, truthfully, you aren’t one with a person, you’re one with their memories. Actually, I think that’s false. It’s a biological binding, not a psychological bonding that makes you one. This is tough. Is marriage the covenant or is marriage what the covenant protects? The covenant is the binding of the law that requires you to remain faithful to your wife. In business law, you are bound to the terms of a contract in marriage (as opposed to being bound to each other). It means, like it or not, you share a house, you share a bank account, you share all of your possessions. But it does not mean you share a life. You can’t legislate affections, attractions, and relationships. You can’t legislate oneness. You’re either one, or you’re not. Even if you’re angry, you’re still one. But if you’re perpetually angry, oxytocin will wear off.

Marriage is a symbol of the oneness between Christ and the church. Think about this, is the symbol greater than what it symbolizes? The ring is a symbol of the marriage bed. Is the ring anything compared to the marriage bed? It’s nothing. So to marriage is nothing compared to what it symbolizes. It isn’t a sacrifice to give up marriage to win as many to the Lord as you can. If one more person is saved by my celibacy than by my marriage, somebody’s eternity is at stake. I will gladly give up the symbol, I will gladly take off my ring if it saves somebody’s marriage. This isn’t sacrifice, this is an exchange, and I’m happy to do it. I’m happy to have power over my will. What does that mean? Power over my will? Does it mean I can behave in a manner that is inconsistent with my will (i.e. even though I want to, I can overcome the urge to do it), or does it mean I can change my will so that I want something different? I don’t know. Either way it’s powerful. Either way it’s power.

Imagine a girl doing porn, “What is wrong with me?” And we try to say, “Nothing is wrong with you, it’s completely normal,” but the truth is if you’re a woman and you do porn, something is wrong with you. Because women are wired to look for behavioral cues of trust, not exclusive physical cues of strength and dexterity outside of that context. Women have lust but it’s always contextual lust. A raw body outside the context of trust should not arouse you, and so it makes sense that books like 50 shades of gay are so popular, because women put themselves inside of that narrative, and they come to trust the characters, and it fills them with lust. Romance novels are a woman’s porn. That’s the parallel. And I’ve heard this porn that women do, supposedly flying in the face of their biological programming, is actually story-line porn. They’re like mini-movies. First you establish characters, and a story, and then you get aroused, but without that foreplay, you will not be aroused. And that makes sense. Because what does a story do? It gives it a context. It’s contextual lust. You have a deterrence mechanism to safeguard you from being aroused by a person who hasn’t vindicated himself as a person you can trust. That’s how women are wired. Why? He’s going to plant a seed in you, and if he doesn’t tend that garden, you will have to gather food, fight off threats, and be all around vulnerable to danger because it’s hard to do all of that when you have a human inside of you. On top of that, without the man to support the child and care for it’s physiological needs, the women has to be like the Ostridge and leave it’s child to go to work. And God saw that and said, “You know what? I'm going to give women a special stipulation for arousal so that they don’t have to go through all of that alone, but they have a husband to support her, and protect her, and do what I, the designer of the body, say she shouldn’t be doing.” You read the Bible, God is very pro-family. He compares women who leave their children to go work like the Ostridge. He’s given you a role at home. He compares men who stay at home and don’t work like the sloth, slow moving and lazy animal.

Healing doesn’t necessitate the laying on hands. Jesus healed the centurion’s man without ever seeing him.

“My wife is a minister.” Does she speak in church? “Of course.” Why does she disobey the Lord, who says women should keep silence in the church, and if she has a question, she should ask her husband? I say to you, what is sin unto the wife is sin unto the husband if he neglects to edify her, because he is the head of the wife, and he has not lead her into righteousness.

I could pray all day if I had the time. I remember a time when I would try and pray for five minuets, and my mind would wander, and I wouldn’t really know what to say. I remember sometimes I would just read scriptures, often a couple of Psalms, because I didn’t have anything to say. Now he has to smack me over the face with a two by four to get me out in half an hour. Otherwise I go for an hour and a half before I realize, “AHH! I need to get to work.” I work for the Lord and not for people. I need to take my work seriously.

What determines what you believe? The soil of your heart when it receives the seed. Critical analysis, hardness of heart, love (love believes all things). Where does critical analysis come from? It’s a belief, right? A belief about the best way to test information (seeds) to see if they are good and true. So where does the belief about critical analysis come from? Either it’s the state of our heart when somebody brainwashes us to believe it, or there’s something autonomous about the way we think and determine things. If it is autonomous, than nothing determines our belief in critical analysis. We determine it. Our minds do. Otherwise you can boil it down to a set of variables and say, “Given these variables, a person will believe in critical analysis.”

If there is no gospel, then all we are is sand slipping through the hour glass. Enjoy it while it’s passing through your fingers.

I’ve been praying a lot about what the Lord wants me to do, and right now I’m a video typographist—I make sermon jams and animate them. And the reason I feel convicted to do that is because media is such a powerful tool of communication in this age. They used to meet in the public squares, the markets, and that’s where they would go to reach people, but I think the biggest place of dialog that’s happening today is in social media. And I put these videos out there, because there are so many people who comment on them, and they are in despair, and there are so many people searching for answers, and all they need is a little guidance, a little direction, someone to point them to the Bible, and explain it to them like Phillip did with the eunuch. And I’ve thought about, “What if I went to work for Wal-Mart, and somebody never found direction because I wasn’t there?” Where will I be able to reach the most people? And it’s been on my heart.

Keep your words few when you pray. You don’t need to give this whole big persuasive speech; you will not persuade God. God knows what you need before you ask you. You just ask, and Jesus mediates for us, and he will handle the persuasion. Trust me, he’s better at it than us anyway. Don’t waste your time giving God a three point sermon about why he should heal your friend. Just pray for it, and ask yourself, “How can I demonstrate my faith to God in what I do and what I say, and how I interact with people?” It’s not about impressing people. It’s about impressing God.

I’m willing to serve however the Lord can use me. I’ll tell you what though, I get jittery making speeches, but Paul said to **desire the greater gifts**, and faith comes by hearing and hearing the words of Christ, so I keep working at it, and praying for it, and I know that no matter what, I’m not trying to persuade people, I’m trying to persuade God that I’m on his team. You know, James said few should be teachers, and I think of Job when God said to his friends, “You haven’t spoken rightly of me,” so it’s definitely not something that I take lightly. I know the things I say about God are the most important things I will say ever, and I want to make sure that I take that seriously, and stick to the Bible.

I think the Lord will be gracious to supply me with that amount. I mean, the truth is it’s all the Lord’s money. Whoever’s hand it’s in, they are managers. And I don’t mean that in a presumptuous way, in the sense that I just expect to mooch off of other people, but in a way that says, “No matter what I make, when the Lord looks down and sees me working hard, he’s going to provide, because he’s my Father.” The Bible says, “The Lord renders to each according to his work.”

I work for the Lord and not for people, and I mean in the most obvious sense. I’m not employed by anyone.

I’m just calling to let you know that I did pray about serving at Vida Nueva,

And I was trying to be diligent in discerning what the Lord’s will is and if he wants me to serve there, and I’ve got to tell you, I wasn’t really convicted one way or another.

and I didn’t really feel God convicting me one way or another in my heart, but that’s usually not the way that the Holy Spirit works with me. You know, I read my Bible and get transformed by the renewal of my mind to discern the will of God in all things, and the only thing I can think of is Ephesians 6, when he says to arm ourselves with the feet of readiness, and other places to serve the Lord with gladness. And so I just wanted to let you know, and be honest about it, that I don’t honestly know what God wants, but as far as I can tell, serving the Lord  … I don’t take this lightly. You know, king Jotham went in to the temple to do the work of a priest, and God struck him with leprosy because of it. So I want to be sure, but as the same time, I think of Romans 10, … If the Lord is paying for me through other people, I want to make sure that it isn’t wasted. All I can say is this, God promises that he will never leave me nor forsake me, and that the same Spirit that raised Christ from the dead lives in me, so no matter what, I’m bring his presence with me, and whatever small part I have, I will do my job as unto the Lord, because I know that I live before an audience of one. The body is made up of many parts, but Paul charges us to desire the greater gifts, and thinking of that principle, you know, I desire the more important roles, but however the Lord wants to use me, I am completely submitted to his will. The hard part is discerning his will, right?

I honestly am not coming up with any scriptures to help me discern if the Lord wants me to serve in this event.

those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary: And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness. (1 Cor. 12).

The only thing I could really think of was Luke 12, when Jesus said, “Unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required,” and, you know, as somebody who’s been on the receiving end of this event, I sure would count it a joy to help out in whatever way I can.

I was in a car riding to the doctor with my dad one time, when half way there I realized we had barely said a word. I thought, “Now why is that?” Thinking about the ride with my mother the day before, when I was talking quite a bit about theology, and philosophy, and psychology, and a whole plethora of topics that were intriguing to me. Why was I conversing so fluidly with my mother and keeping so silent with my dad? Is it the difference between boys and girls? No, because it was mainly myself who initiated conversation. Was it that I am just more comfortable with my mom? Maybe, but I didn’t feel uncomfortable in the car. I was quite enjoying the peaceful sky and the quiet ride, perhaps more than a conversation. One thing I thought about was maybe when I talk, it’s an attempt to fill in the space of wasted time. With every stranger, I talk very rapidly and quickly, and I think it’s because I want to cram as much in as I can before never seeing them again. It’s also good for first impressions to have this reciprocally fluid conversational compatibility. But when I’m with my dad, I’m not in a rush. I don’t feel pressured to not waste time, and I can just sit back and enjoy the sky and the trees and the quiet. Why is that? I think everything I do is in some sense relative to him. When he’s working in his office, I’m sure to keep myself busy at my computer so that he doesn’t catch me wasting time. When he goes on a date with my mom, I’m more lenient with my schedule, and more likely to entertain my little sister’s invitations to play with her. And it’s not just about being found out. There’s a sense in me that says, “If my dad’s not working, then I’ve put in enough hours today. I’ve met my father’s expectations by doing what he does. Now I can relax.” And so I get anxious waiting for things and wasting time when I’m with strangers, because relative to my dad, I’m not accomplishing much, and he will not be proud of me. I think this is an unspoken string of thought in my psychology. And so when my dad is driving, and he doesn’t need to talk, I feel like I don’t need to “redeem” that wasted time by talking, as it were. My dad isn’t expecting anything more of me. I think one of the biggest fears we have is disappointing our parents. When they look as us, thinking, “He’s wasting his life.” The only times I ever really feel like we’re on vacation is when my dad is there. As long as he’s not working, he doesn’t demand it of me.

The main point of discipleship is familiarizing people with the promises of God, such that the beliefs that underlie all their behavior morphs in commensurate measure, and they live in light of the promises of God. Raw belief, however, is not enough to change behavior. You say, “What else is there?” Loss aversion. People need wisdom. Often times just saying it out loud and defining it in the parameters of language is enough for people to go, “Oh, duh. That really makes sense.” “If I don’t do work, I’ll have to give $10,000 to charity!” “Why do you think this is going to work when you may have already lost more than that amount of money by not making videos?” [Boyinaband](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd4UW5f7s4) hadn’t been working for a whole year, and if he had worked he could have earned a lot of money. So when you think about it, he’s kind of already faced that threat. The reason losing $10,000 motivates him to work more than the tens of thousands of dollars he didn’t earn by not working is due to two reasons, both of which involve things we all have in our brains that are completely illogical: The first is loss aversion, the name for how our brains put a higher value on losing something than gaining it. To our brains, losses are twice as valuable as gains. The other reason is hyperbolic discounting. This is where our brains value things that are in the present much more than things in the future. Like disproportionately more. Which results in us making some stupid decisions. Hyperbolic discounting can make two marshmallows in 15 minutes less valuable than 1 marshmallow [right now](http://redheartlife.com/failing-the-marsmallow-test-and-20-years-after/). And so when you look at a Christian, and you say, “If they really believed in the promises of God enumerated in the Bible, they would live differently than they do now. They would sell their possessions to receive 100 fold, they would live n repentance towards God because that’s profitable, they would forsake all their sin, or they would at least try really hard to.” Well, no. That’s not always the case, and the reason is loss aversion and hyperbolic discounting. Show me in the Bible where God says, “You must live as though my promises are true, or I’m going to say you never believed them in the first place.” That’s not what he says. That’s the way it was with the Flood. And with Jericho. And with Abraham. But it’s not what he says to us. He doesn’t say, “March around Jericho so that I know you believe my promise. Demonstrate your faith to me, and live like you believe it.” He just says, “Believe.” We do not have to overcome loss aversion and hyperbolic discounting to be saved. It will be profitable for us. 1 Corinthians 3. But it isn’t what gets us saved. Abraham, Noah, and Daniel were justified by their works (which came from faith—Noah had to believe the flood was coming or he wouldn’t have built the ark), but God never once stipulates eternal salvation on us building our arks. Sometimes Christians live in sin. Sometimes Christians live in disobedience to God, and they don’t live like heaven is real, but that doesn’t automatically make them an unbeliever, just because there is a mismatch between what they say they believe and how they live. Hypocrisy isn’t just a behavior that tells a lie, it’s a behavior that betrays a belief. When that father tells his son not to drink while he’s holding a bear in his hand, he might prefer not to drink himself. Just because he’s drinking doesn’t mean he believes drinking is a good decision that he wants his son to be involved in. He just won’t stop. His actions betray his beliefs, even though he really believes it. Other times your actions can tell a lie, but here it betrays a belief. And we are not wise enough to discern the difference, and we shouldn’t pretend we are when we’re judging somebody’s eternal salvation. We should just talk to them, and explain it to them, and disciple them. But all I can say is this, when you discount them as a Christian with that kind of judgement, Jesus said with whatever measure of judgement you use, so too will it be judged unto you. And so it is, because people like Steven Anderson judge Ray Comfort as an unsaved person, because Ray comfort judges Christian hypocrites as unsaved. If we could just get people to understand loss aversion and hyperbolic discounting, we might be able to get them to repent towards God. We should be trying to explain to them the whole counsel of God, and the profit of repentence towards God, and the concept of inheritance in heaven vs entering in as one escaping the fire, and understanding the after, and they might understand and say, “Oh, I want to live for God, because it’s going to be better for me in the end.” But telling them, “You’re unsaved if you live that way” doesn’t help anybody. It just makes them say, “Well, belief clearly wasn’t enough, so I better get to work,” and then they’re trusting their own works instead of trusting Jesus finished work on the cross, and they look in that mirror and walk away and forget that they’re sinners, because they’ve been told, “In order to be a Christian, you need to live right.”

I did not have a teacher growing up. I was homeschooled, and my mom attended more to my older sister and siblings that were doing harder stuff than little Ethan, who didn’t really need mom’s help. (Well, over time, I learned that mom wasn’t paying much attention to me, so I started flipping open the answer key and started copying answers. If you had the ring to make you invisible, wouldn’t you? So I started that early on, and continued all the way to until college, when I was terrified.) So I didn’t have a teacher through pretty much grades 3 to 12. I walked into college, and there were these people who stood in front of the class, told you exactly what you needed to know, told you what to study, how to study, and in many cases even gave out a study guide for the test, flashing neon lights that say, “This is what you need to know.” I’m telling you, they make life a lot easier. Everything I always had to figure out for myself, they served us on a silver platter. “This is what you need to do.” That’s when I learned that school does not test intelligence, it tests obedience. “This is what you need to do.” You either did it or you didn’t. It just depends on how lazy you are. That’s all your grade reflects. But today, the exams are so straightforward, you can get A’s without ever showing up to class. I got an A in my Texas government class by showing up 5 times: once for every exam we had. That was it. I didn’t even buy the book (after all, at community college, the textbooks cost as much as tuition).

I’m going to ask you a question that you don’t need to answer, and I won’t judge it one way or the other. Are you a virgin? “Yes.” Good. Why? – People are always caught off guard when I asked them that question. “Uh—I.” What? You just haven’t gotten around to it? Some people are abstinent by choice, and some people by the lack thereof. Abstinence doesn’t tell me you’re a virtuous person, and most people can’t even defend why purity is so valuable and precious. It’s just, “That’s how I was raised.” Do a better job parent and pastors. Frankly it shocks me when I run into somebody who hasn’t had sex outside of marriage, and after hearing the outlier Christians who actually don’t defile themselves, I can understand why. Nobody gives them a good reason. They don’t even have a Bible verse ready, except, “Thou shalt not commit adultery.” Really? That’s not even about fornication. That’s about people breaking wed-lock. I ask people why they are a virgin, and that is the last question they expect. I’m surprised it hasn’t crossed your mind in the course of your life, “Why am I denying this powerful urge to be intimate with someone?” I mean, the pressure is real. If nobody has tempted you to sleep with them, that either speaks loud volumes about your chaste behavior that cues people to know, “Off limits,” or it speaks loud volumes about your face that cues people, “Not interested in her.” That face thing—there’s somebody who will sleep with you no matter what face you have.

An opinion can be shown to be untrue. Subjective doesn’t mean there isn’t truth, it just means truth depends on that subject. “I like ice cream.” You could be lying. And it can be shown that you’re lying through science. If somebody bats their eyes at you and says, “Yummy,” you can quantify the biological rules of attraction of determine that they are lying. That aren’t attracted to me, because I have features which indicate incapability of protecting the family on an evolutionary level. Next time somebody pays you a compliment, just grin and say, “That’s a subjective enigma.”

My family condemned me for tormenting because it was illegal, and then turned around and bought raw milk off the farm, which is also illegal. If I didn’t like the milk, I would argue that it’s illegal. If I liked the milk, I would argue that it doesn’t matter. But I noticed that, and I said, “So you’ll condemn something if you don’t like it?” Once you show that you’re willing to break the law, you show that “it’s illegal” isn’t really your reason, because buying raw milk off the farm is also “illegal,” and you’ll do that. You were willing to try that illegal dirt to help cure your cancer, and it worked. The truth is you won’t submit to the law, you’ll only submit to the parts that you agree with, just like me. You’ll submit to the parts that you like. And maybe the parts that you’re neutral with, but when you disagree with the law, you won’t follow it. That is actually part of a school of legal jurisprudence called “Natural Law,” which says that individuals should have the freedom to disobey a law enacted by majorities of people if their individual conscience goes against the law and they believe the law is wrong.

I disrespect Deborah because she came back from PNG wineyer than ever. She is more wicked now than before, and from ignorance. She does not know the will of God because she is not filled with the words of God, and she lacks a discerning mind. Let her ask God who richly supplies wisdom. I would have her go again to a distant land, save I know she is not fit for the work. She does not possess the seed which she has gone to scatter. A missionary has no business mooching the church’s money to babysit foreigners, mow lawns, and build houses. That’s what they did in the days of Noah! Your mission is a heavenly calling, not an earthly one. You are a genetic engineer, learning how to modify the genes of the seed of the gospel to grow in the soil of a foreign nation.

What is she afraid of? Is she afraid of losing her soul? Then she doesn’t know the gospel. Is she afraid of putting off this earthly tent? Then she hasn’t seen the beauty of Christ, who she will be joined with at that time. She shirks from Revelation because she turns away from terror; then she does not know God, whose name causes the demons to shudder, and whose fragrance caused all of his servants to tremble. You haven’t given her a spirit of fear, but a sound mind. But she is terrified of every shadow that passes the wall behind her. She closes her ears to the talk of fallen angels, and interrupts loudly, “La, la, la,” at the mention of the Nephilim. She shuns the counsel of God; no wonder she lacks a mind of discernment. If she believes your promises, that you are with her, that you will never leave her nor forsake her, that you gave given her the Holy Spirit as the earnest of her inheritance, and that the same Spirit who raised Christ from the dead lives in her, why is she afraid demons? There is only one answer: she doesn’t know God. She isn’t afraid of him. She doesn’t understand that the beginning of wisdom is the fear of the Lord, and therefore she has no wisdom. She doesn’t even have the beginning of wisdom. If she understood the fear of God, she wouldn’t be afraid of his enemies. They are afraid of him. 2,000 demons stood before Jesus and pleaded with him, “Don’t send us into the abys!” 2,000 demons! Trembled before Jesus. What are you afraid of? The spirit of God lives in you, demons are afraid of him, and it doesn’t cross your mind that you’re safe? You either don’t believe his promises, you don’t understand his promises, or you don’t know God. Don’t you dare, Ethan, let any unwholesome word proceed from your mouth, except that which is good for edification, according to the need of the moment, so that it will give grace to them that hear. Be gracious. Put a guard on the door of your mouth. Let only so much pass as the Lord would have you speak. But don’t just neglect to admonish the saints because you need them to love you.

“Unless the Lord watches over the city, the watchman stay awake in vain.” Wait a minute—_unless_ the Lord watches over it? Doesn’t that sound opposite? I mean, if the Lord is watching over it, you don’t need to. “Thanks God. I’ll go off to sleep now. Because you’re watching the city.” But the Bible says, “No, it’s actually vain if he isn’t watching.” How can this be? Maybe God watches over the city through the eyes of the watchman. The Bible says God rewards us according to our work. If he looks down, and he sees us slacking off, he’ll watch over us slackly. “Then how does he make a lick of difference? If the people who train become strong and victories, and the people who don’t become weak and defeated? Won’t that happen anyway?” What we need to understand is that

I find the evidence of design too overwhelming to dismiss as the product of natural selection. “It just has the appearance of design. It started out simple, and then it became complex. The unhelpful mutations that don’t have the appearance of design aren’t around because they don’t survive, and the species with helpful mutations survive, therefore everything looks as though it’s been tailor made for the world we live in, when actually the world we live in has tailor made us.” That’s not compelling to me. If all I had in front of me was a 1 celled ameba, I still could not escape design. It’s incredibly complex.

For this reason a man shall leave father and mother: to be joined to his wife. If you aren’t joined with a wife, why are you leaving? “Well I just want to be independent.” What does that even mean? You want to spend money that you don’t need to spend. Our food bill, utilities bill, all of our expenses dropped by nothing when Brian moved out. He was not being a burden. Why? Because most of these expenses are not per capita. So you just want to spend money that you don’t need to spend. You want privacy that you don’t need to have. You want freedom that God says you don’t have. “I don’t need to listen to my parents now! I want to watch whatever I want, sleep with whoever I want, live my life however I want, and my parents can’t tell me what to do, because I moved out.” But hear’s the thing: the Bible says, “If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them: Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place; And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard. And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.” But wait a minute. A glutton and a drunkard? Are they talking about a little kid? They’re talking about a grown man. And when the Bible says, “Honor your parents,” it’s talking about taking care of them when they’re too old to work. According to the Bible, moving out doesn’t mean you stop obeying your parents. They don’t stop becoming your parents because you aren’t mooching off of them anymore. Honoring oyur parents is actually the opposite. It’s when they depend on you, and you still honor them. So what are you moving out for then? “Well I’m not going to attract someone while I’m living with my parents.” Yeah that’s right. But if you’re living with your wife, you still have a pretty good chance. You don’t want to attract the kind of person who needs to not be around your family to like you. He should like your family. Why? Because you’re part of it. And he’s taking you out of it and bringing you into his. And you should like your family. And if he doesn’t like your family, but you do like them, why does he like you?

I’m bummed out. And I’m excited. I just learned that Bethany found someone, a good guy, more than 8 months ago. I hope she has a wonderful life with him, and I mean that. They won’t break up—it’s too late in life for that. Now I will have no one to talk to in my imaginations, and I will be finally free from fantastic conversations. I pray my surrogate will not be another woman who can not hear me, nor one who can, but the true God of heaven and earth. I am not sorrowful for this. I rejoice with gladness. God is my treasure, and a distraction has been taken from me. I have enough doctrine to be content with this. I know God well enough to know that he’s the best being I can spend my efforts to know. No one will replace Bethany. She was a woman who fears the Lord, and I’ve never known another like her. My affections have crashed and burned, and they will not jump to another. Blessed be the Lord, who has gone to great lengths to free me from a wondering eye. She was my only love, and so love perishes with her. No more stories, no more visions, no more fantasies, but work for the Lord and his glory. I wasted an hour and a half today—but maybe it was worth it to uncover this, this event which will change the dwelling of my mind in all the days ahead of me. Lord, guard me from Celest, Abby, Amy, Julia, and any other who would capture my affections. Celest has a boyfriend, but I envision them breaking up. Let my affections die with the taking of this one woman. First I cast them on Savannah, then Kayleigh, and for a long time, Bethany. But there is no one else like her, and I will find no one else like her. God forbid my heart would desire her to break up with Tanner. If ever a man could be judged by his smile, and by the innocence of his eyes, this is a good man. Give them a good life after you, dear God, and draw them in zeal for your kingdom, that they would not waste their marriage. So too draw me in zeal for your kingdom, that I would not waste my singleness. You have given me everything I need for life and godliness. Amen.

God, this is heavy. But it makes me feel light. My heart is brought low from loss, but from loss my heart becomes unburdened. My yoke has been relinquished. My heart is sad, and I seek solace, but it’s a very soothing sadness, and one that I hope will lift my continence in the end. You’ve looked after the interests of one who would have otherwise waited forever. I would not know what to do with a woman, and there has never been a time when I was comfortable imagining consummation, but I fear intimacy. Good; it is a convenience, even as my distaste for soda. Give me the same Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead, dear God. You’ve given me that Spirit. What else do I require? I have the earnest of my inheritance. Let me do what’s profitable, and lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us. Marriage was never a sin to me, but it was a weight, even a weight that has been taken from me, and in loss, I am able to run without hinderence. Praise the Lord. Praise God, and give my sorrowful heart a place to pray, and a place of peace. I am free now. I think I can do this now. There is no other woman I want. God has descensatized me from the cucumber by showing me the grape, and has cast the grape aside, that I might live in view of the surpassing value of knowing him. Though there are many cucumbers in front of me, I do not desire them in view of the grape, which I cannot have. And therefore there is only one prize in front of me, and so I run, not as one who is cought between pleasing God and pleasing his wife, but wholly devoted to the God who greatly supports those whose hearts are completely his.

Who am I living for now? Who am I trying to impress or win over by my godliness? I’m realizing that at its root, my motivations were wacked out and twisted, though I would have denied it. I maintained hope to be married while I preached against it. I knew intellectually what I couldn’t match in my heart. Now I can really address this issue in its fullness, and become who I need to be before God, not before an imaginary lover who fears God. Hypocrite that I am. It’s hard to walk out what I’ve seen in the Bible, and what I’ve been convicted of in my heart. “People only pursue God to impress a lover. The world needs people to love God with a pure, holy, and undefiled heart.” But do you who say it have a pure heart? I strive to obtain one.

How will I record adjustments to trades in thinkorswim? Right-Click, insert (so that it will be the same color, letting you know it’s an adjustment), add closing order, add new order,

When people say, “Women are just as equal as men,” I ask, “Which man, and which women?” Men are not all equal to begin with, so how can you compare a big overarching generalization like men and women?

What Lordship salvationists do is they look at a child with a marshmallow, and say, “If you believe me, I’ll come back in 15 minutes, and if you don’t eat your marshmallow, I’ll come back with another marshmallow, and you’ll have two,” and they say, “See? The child ate his marshmallow. That means he didn’t believe them, because if he believed them, he wouldn’t have waited for the marshmallow. So now the parent just won’t come back at all, because he only comes for them that believe, and this child obviously doesn’t believe.” That’s just not true, and imagine that poor little child being told, “Because you ate your marshmallow, you don’t really believe your parent is coming back for you, and he’s only coming back if you believe. So believe!” “Huh? But I did believe.” “If you believed, you wouldn’t have eaten the marshmallow.” “I didn’t know that—the marshmallow was just too tempting!” Chalk it up to loss aversion and hyperbolic discounting, not lack of belief. Lordship salvationists are terrible psychologists. And that’s what this is: a question of psychology, not soteriology. Because everybody believes, “You need to believe if your parent is to come back for you.” Where Lordship salvationists differ from us is in trying to determine the wheat from the chaff (that is, the saved from the unsaved, the believers from the non believers, those who profess faith from those who possess faith), which even the angels were commanded, “Not so, lest the grain be uprooted with the chaff.” And then there’s straight up repentance gospel preachers which aren’t even saved, who say the same things as every other religion, “You need to work to get to God. You need to repent to be saved,” instead of, “God promises sanctification to everyone who believes,” which he doesn’t anyway. But don’t be too quick to discount someone as unsaved because of how they judge other people who live in sin, whether they are saved or not. But I will say this though, Jesus said with whatever measure of judgement with which you judge, so to it will be judged unto you. So when these Lordship Salvationists judge Christians as unsaved, it’s no surprise that many judge them as unsaved.

People say, “You’re making excuses.” No, reasons for behavior don’t excuse behavior, but they help explain it. They help smooth over the inherent animosity that exists between the plaintiff and the defendant.

[Misunderstood quote from James.] This is what happens when you read other people’s mail. The reason James’ letter begins with, “To the twelve tribes of Israel scattered abroad,” is because his letter is esoteric. That means, likely to be only understood by the Jews. But since you’re so set on James, let’s talk about what he’s trying to say.

Hey, don’t go easy on me. The test of a good leader is if he’s willing to chew out his employees when they’re doing a slack job.

Sometimes it’s better to give up. Faith and I spent an hour searching for a Mario plush that she lost, only to walk up stairs into her room, and find him laying neatly across her pillow. We could have saved a lot of time if we simply said, “He’ll show up,” and stopped searching. Don’t presume that perseverance is the best choice. Good leadership is the wisdom to know when perseverance is waste.

Whenever I hear people say, “Interpret the Bible,” I always like to just remind them that the Bible is written in English. I don’t need an interpreter, because the Bible is written in English, and I speak English, so I don’t need an interpreter. And people use this code word, “Interpret the Bible,” and this is what they do: They look at what the Bible says, they don’t like it, so they just say, “That’s not what it means. It actually means XYZ, and that’s my interpretation.” Well, I just read the Bible, and I believe what it says. I don’t interpret it. I try not to interpret it. I just read it, and that’s what it says.

God’s love is not for everybody. It says in Hosea 9:15, “All their wickedness is in Gilgal, for there I hated them: for the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine house, I will love them no more: all their princes are revolters.”

I have made two observations that fit together. When I went to jury duty, and again when I went to VN meetings, I remember having lenthy, fast-paced conversations about Jesus and Christian doctrine, and I walked away always feeling like the world is full of people who have crazy ideas that are not suitable for a Christian to have, and don’t fit in with the Bible. I remember people’s speech patterns and mannerisms, and it felt like something similar to being in a room full of autistic people. Everybody had a lot to say, and was quick to say it, but it just seemed to be shallow, illogical, and out of step with good reason. The almost slurred as though they were drunk, and their eyes fixed strongly. I wrote about this experience with poetry, looking for wise men more than hidden jewels. In college, everybody seems rational, well spoke, neatly articulate, and not so quick to speak. How odd, right? I mean, doesn’t wisdom come with age and experience? Why then are these college students so much more intelligent, wise, and thoughtful than older men? My second observation began when my days began to be so filled up that I did not have time to think, to meditate on God’s word, and to search through the deep things of God, politics, philosophy, and science. I was a roster cha, trying frantically to keep up with everybody’s fees and receipts, and came home exhausted, crashing until the next event. It is my theory that work keeps a man from thinking, because he is too busy to think, whereas children have time to ponder things. Men are too abrasive and frankly stupid. My people are wise people, whether young or old, and it seems to be the young who think deeply.

I really resonate with that Nazi kid in “I Am Not Ashamed.” Do you know what it is to walk into a room and hate literally everybody in there? It doesn’t take Nietzschean philosophy to look at genocide as a cleansing. I’ve never been that Nazi kid, but I know what it is when that girl said, “I don’t see it as suicide. I see it as homicide.”

“Prove to me that your God exists!” 13. How did Rachel Scott write down 13 tears right before 13 students were shot? You think it was collusion? (Actually, that has a certain degree of verisimilitude. If you read her journals, it’s clear that she wanted to make a difference, and also that she comteplated suicide, and didn’t want to keep living. She said she considered it homicide, not suicide. Maybe she got to know the Nazi boy before it happened. Maybe she knew he had beef with 13 people. Maybe she manipulated him, or maybe they worked to together. But as someone who’s been on that edge, I know the mind of suicide can make you contemplate crazy things. Sometimes the only thing preventing it is the thought of absurdity, and you think, “As long as I’m going to kill myself, I may as well make my death worth something.” You want purpose. Everybody asks, “Why?” Because we are evolved to assume design, to assume purpose and reason, to identify patterns and breaches of patterns. It’s what keeps us alive as humans. It never crosses our minds that some things are just absurd. She drew 13 dears. She also drew a flower. 13 tears watered that flower. That can mean two things: the impact their lives have had on people, or sowed perishable and raised imperishable. Why not 15 tears? God does not delight in the death of the wicked. Why 13 tears? Something nefarious was going on. I think maybe she was craftier than people realize. Then again, if I assume a girl can predict 13 deaths, why would I assume God can’t? Here’s why: because you can only predict what you play a apart in, and I don’t think it was God’s wrath that caused these people to die. On the other hand, God searches the hearts of men. It’s possible that it was in their heart’s to kill 13 people. How did Eric and Dylan die?) That’s nonsense. How do you explain 13? “Coincidence.” That’s my point. They coincide. Probabilities are way too low to say they weren’t connected. You’d have to throw your brain into a pot and mush it around to take that position. So you tell me, why 13 tears? There’s 7 billion people in the world, how many of them draw 13 tears? And it just happens to be one of the 13 victims. You can call yourself wise, but if you just look the other way when this is slapping you in the face, you are a fool. “Is it possible that somebody else drew the tears after the fact? I mean, people will lie for Jesus.” Except it would be really hard to forge something like that. And with bullet holes. And then there was the man with the dream. You going to explain that away too? If this was your evidence and I denied it, you’d call me a conspiracy theorist, and you’d be right.

You can’t solve every problem; sometimes you have to sidestep them. If every time something went wrong, you said, “No, I’m going to figure out the root cause of the problem so that it won’t happen again in the future,” rather than just saying, “Okay, how can we work around this?” you will not get very much accomplished. “My e-mail app isn’t working.” “Just send your e-mail online.” “No, I want to get it working.” The reason that ends up being a waste of time is because a lot of times things start working by themselves, and all the effort you spend trying to figure it out becomes useless. It’s like you spent hours and hours troubleshooting problems, and when the solution finally arrived, it had nothing to do with the hours of troubleshooting you spent. I’m not saying never troubleshoot problems. But I’m saying you need to have good judgement in figuring out what can wait. And before you start troubleshooting, always pray. Pray about how God wants you to use your time, because you are working for him. And always remember that he can get more done in 5 minutes than you can get done in 5 hours. An idea comes into your head.

There are cardinal doctrines, primary doctrines, secondary doctrines, and false doctrines.

Pornography was so taboo to you, you wouldn’t even think to bring it up to warn me about it. Why the hell would you assume I would have the guts to tell you that I was addicted to it, when you didn’t even have the guts to warn me about it? If it’s too shameful a topic for you to even tell me, “Avoid that,” how the hell do you think I’m going to muster up the courage to tell you I’m hooked on it? I’m not making excuses, and this doesn’t excuse me, but I mean this truthfully, it’s your fault that I became addicted to porn. You should’ve had the sense to know that I would have access to it before I had the maturity to say, “No.” You should’ve known, because God’s word has charged you with training me up in the way I should go, and you didn’t warn me. I would have done what the Bible says, and honored the marriage bed before my kids, and taught them what it’s all about, but you let me find out the holy things of marriage on my own, and for that reason I discovered them apart from that context. Make no mistake, you were responsible for my purity, and it’s your fault that I am the way I am. It’s not an excuse. It doesn’t excuse me. But all I’m saying is that if I had kids, I would expect them to be tempted, and I would’ve prepared them for it, and you didn’t do that with me, and neither is anybody else, and people wonder why my generation is so promiscuous. You unrighteous hypocrites! … I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I just feel like you’ve neglected to parent me. I feel like my whole generation has been neglected in that regard. They boast in their shame.

Should prayer prepare me for your word, or should your word prepare me for prayer?

If thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted? And if thou doest not well, sin layeth at the door. And sin has been communing with me lately, so what does that tell me? That I’m not doing well. Lord, I’ve been struggling to know how to discern your will, and praying, and studying your word, and at the end of the day depending on the convictions of my heart to guide me. But I know that the heart is deceitful, and convictions are a dangerous guide in life. But since sin is laying at the door, and that happens if I do not do well, I may infer that I am not doing well, and that what I’m doing is not your will. So, Lord, I will follow you and your will for me, and I will do as you tell me. The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. I’m realizing now that all I really care about is what you care about. I only want to admonish a brother if they really are walking out of step with your approval. And I don’t want to presumptuously judge that they are following the voice of a stranger, or the voice of their own heart, and calling it the voice of God. These people who chant, “It’s not a religion, it’s a relationship,” seem to be the least concearned with knowing the true God. As long as you call him LORD, you can worship a golden calf crafted in your mind, or whatever you thought up about God. And that bugs me, but I only want it to bug me if it bugs you, Lord. And I want to be sure that they are doing things that way before I admonish them. Do counsil me, Lord, I seek your will. I will keep on with animation today, and if I do well, and sin walks away from the door, then I keep doing it. And if I do not well, and sin layeth at the door, than I will amend my doings in the day, trial and error until I discover your will. Perhaps I will amp up trading, half the day, and textbook of doctrine for the other half. Or perhaps I will go get a job, and be employed somewhere, and do my work as unto the Lord. I pray, Lord, that you give me opportunity to work on “Till” this lunch break. I will seek you in your word, now. Guide me, help me, guard me from error, and teach me by your Spirit in Jesus name, amen.

Anderson says that we should always derive doctrine from staements in the Bible, not stories in the Bible, but we see the apostles violating that principle all the time. Read Hebrews, or the Pauline epistles.

I have a real burden for Romans 10 Christians, who have zeal for God, and they love God, and they say it’s not a religion, it’s a relationship, and they wear a Christian bracelet, and they teach Sunday School, and their playlists are full of worship songs, but their zeal for God is not according to knowledge about God. They’re like Job’s friends. They’ve been patted on the shoulder for everything they say about God, and so they think Bible study is when we all get together and talk about what we think about God and the Christian life, and no matter what they say, somebody affirms you, and encourages you, and you’re never wrong. I have a burden for you, America. I’m not angry. I just want you to know him. I want you to know God as he is, the true God, because so many of you, and you don’t realize you’re doing this, but you live a Christianity that’s out of step with the Bible, and I want to call you back to the beauty, and purity, and unmatched glory of God’s word, and what he really says, and what’s true, not just what’s popular. Because I promise you, the true beauty of the true Christ far outshines all the imaginations of man, when we craft a God in our imagination to suit us. Jesus was the Light, and men rejected him, because everybody looks good in dim lighting, and they wanted to look good. And so Jesus can be uncomfortable, but it is so worth it to step out into the truth of his word, and ask the Spirit to really teach you the whole counsel of God. I say this with tears, that you might receive the imperishable treasures of eternal life, of knowing the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom he has sent into the world. I’m calling you to step down from being ignorant about the Bible, and without knowing it, disobeying God’s word. I’m calling you to look at the qualifications of church leaders. I’m calling you to keep the church unleavened (and yes, I mean kick members out who are living in the deeds of darkness, which ought not be named among us—kids that fornicate and look at pornography, and adults who commit adultery, and divorce). It’s popular to say, “The church is not a museum for good people, it’s a hospital for the broken,” but that’s flawed and twisted, and it’s straight from hell. I have a burden for you to know the unsearchable riches of God’s word in its entirety. It’s better than you know. And the most difficult part of my burden for you is that most of you will walk away and be content with the God that you’ve crafted to suit you, and the God that many churches in America has crafted to suit themselves, not realizing you’re breaking the second command. You have all the right language, you use all the same names, but it’s another Christ, another gospel, and another God. Foreknowledge, omnipresence, omnipotence. Don’t listen to people who tell you that. Don’t listen to people say, “God XYZ.” Don’t go to Bible college. Go to the Bible.

I was praying this morning when Caleb came out of his room quetly, stopped, and went down stairs. It wasn’t akward to be caught praying. It felt kind of good actually. I suppose I get too caught up in the awkwardness of people inturupting, and going from spiritual to “down to earth” in a split second. “Plow up the fallow ground of our hearts that restrict us from seeing the beauty of Chri…” “Yo, Ethan dawg.” “What?”

What is your argument leaning on right now? Your own understanding or God’s word? It shocks me the absolute faithlessness of people who are zealous for God but don’t follow the Bible. And you don’t take it seriously. And some of you say, “Well I didn’t know that was in there.” Then you don’t believe the Bible, because you can’t believe in what you don’t know. You can’t believe in something you haven’t heard. And yet you spend so much time reading the Bible. What’s your excuse for not being faithful to it and actually obeying God’s will? Jesus said whoever hears these words of mine and does not act on them, I will liken unto a foolish man who built his house upon the sand. I worry that you’re a 1 Corinthians 3 Christian, whose entire work and devotion and all the time you spent for God will be meaningless because you failed to act on Jesus words. The house of your work will collapse because you built it on sand, and the house of your work will burn because you build it with cheap materials. If you have really read the Bible as much as you say, and you still don’t take it seriously, the soil of your heart, I’m afraid, is callous and fallow to the seed of God’s word. These cheap little Christian mantras, slogans, and clichés flow out of your mouth like a river, and they are out of step with the Bible. “I don’t want to be involved in your event, because the leaders are so outstandingly irreverent with the word of God, and I’ve heard them profane it, and twist it, and lie about it, and it’s unbiblical for men like that to be teachers among the saints. They are unqualified.” “Well, if you think about like this, then you ought to want to be there even more so that you can be a light to them.” Like, do you even read your Bible? You want me to go there so that I can counteract the people I disagree with, and sow discord among brothers because they’re living in disobedience, and you want me to participate in that? The best thing for this event is if it dissolves from being ignored, not if it keeps going by being addressed. God didn’t say, “Overthrow the heretics!” He said, “Avoid them.” So that’s what I’m going to do. Live a quiet life.

People say, “Nobody can understand KJV.” Andersons: “That’s funny, because my kids can understand it.” “That’s because you’re there to explain it to them, which makes it like a cult, because if nobody can understand it, it depends on people like you to tell people what it means. It’s no different than the Latin Vulgate!” Like, bro, somebody has to explain language to you before you can read the Bible. In that sense, every religion is a cult, because you can make language anything you want. “Communicate with my afflictions” is barely understandable today, unless you realize that communicate sounds like commune, or community. That is, share with, or participate in. The Latin Vulgate was perverted. The KJV was preserved.

For me, the KJV debate always crumbled at practicality. “What doctrine is different?” I thought, “Any doctrine that’s in the KJV is in the NASB, and the ESV, and you can teach the whole counsel of God with either one.” You know? I wanted specific reasons, and specific instances where it would actually make a difference to me. You know, you’d have people saying, “It changed Lucifer to son of man!” And I’m like, “So what? Doesn’t make a lick of difference in my doctrine, because there’s a thousand other verses that talk about it.” It wasn’t until I saw differences in some doctrines that I actually did get from the newer Bibles that troubled me, and they weren’t in the KJV. “No one born of God makes a practice of sinning.” “After they committed all these things, I thought they would return, but they did not return.” Those were huge challenges to me that I spend years struggling with and trying to reconcile, and then it turns out they aren’t even in the KJV. It will always depend on how it actually impacts you if you choose to switch. I wasn’t going to start rapping in KJV if the NASB taught the same doctrines. (I wouldn’t even think of touching the NET or NLT though, just because of how watered down they sound. “You think you are so safe that you go on doing all those hateful sins!” I thought I was reading a high school girl’s Bible study contributions.)

The main thing about these events is I walk away from them and go, “It’s not worth it. It’s just not worth it.” The time, the money, and energy that goes into them, and for what? I mean, I’ve done discipleship, I’m sure you’ve disciple young kids, that’s what brings about sanctification and growth and repentence towards God and knowing more fully the riches of Christ in us. Discipleship shouldn’t be through manipulative events, where kids need to depend on the buzz that happens during worship, during the real spiritual high that comes from the way we preach, and the music. That’s a drug, not the real thing. If oyu can go into the woods and get a buzz, but you can’t go into the Bible and get the same buzz, it’s not God. And that’s the problem I have. I’ve been to these events, and they make you feel. And they get you pumped. And you think they change your life but they don’t. And every now and then you run into somebody who isn’t the same person (halleluiah), but that could have happened a lot sooner if people in the church lived the gospel instead of putting on events like this on to get to people’s hearts. That’s not discipleship. And you won’t find justification for it in the Bible. Show me a verse that supports doing it this way.

It’s gets better every time. The Lord really…

I’m not into what the world is into. I’m into the Bible, and into Jesus, and I approve things that stir my affections for him. Put me in front of some hymns, and I’m perfect. I love things that honor God in spirit and in truth, Matthew 4. But as far as all of this nonsense, rock and roll, look, the Bible says be not conformed to the patterns of the world. I’m not into it. Plus, the real this about that is that you can’t broad brush kids about what music they’re going to like. There’s no flavor that’s going to suit everyone.

If I wanted to be popular with the interests of teenagers, I would be taking a step backwards, not taking them a step forwards. I’m not interested in catering to their appetites. The Bible says put a knife to thy throat if thou be a man given to appetite. And Paul says he mourned because there were so many in the church whose God were their stomachs. They did whatever they wanted to do. Whatever they felt like. Whatever was fun. We’re not here to smooth out this event so that they go back home and say, “Man, we really had a lot of fun.” Forget that. We’re not here to play games. The world is passing away, and people are perishing. This is war. We’re training them up. We need that kind of mindset. God said to be wise with our time because the days are evil. Whay we need to understand is that our time is just like our money; it’s not our own. God purchased us with a price, and we belong to him. We’re stewards of our time, body brain; we’re just managing it, and we need to ask God what he wants us to do, and if we’re spending out time playing games… Jesus said the end tiems will be as it was in the days of Noah: they’ll be eating, drinking, trading, building. Which of those are sins? Eating? Drinking? They aren’t sins. The point was they were just living life. Without any thought of the end. Jesus said set your treasures above, and Paul picked it up in Colossians 3, set your mind above. Our job is not to help these students disobey that verse. Sanctification isn’t what’s popular, and being true to the Bible isn’t always what people want to hear, it’s what people need to hear. We should be discipline these kids.

The idea that you cannot get remission for sins without going to a priest undermines the gospel. Either it will make you a legalist, which means you have to go running to a priest every hour, or it will make you an antinomian, who says, “I can go out and clobber people and do anything I want, and just show up and get confession every 7 days.” It destroys grace.

You can’t do everything as unto the Lord. Why? Because if I imagined that I was serving the Lord on Saturday, I would prepare my butt off to get ready, which means I would need to set aside time during the week to do that. But then, if during the week, I’m working as unto the Lord, I can’t set aside that time to prepare for the service I’ll be doing on Saturday, because I’m working for the Lord and not for people now. And so there’s never time to prepare. You just show up and do the best that you can.

How do you preach to peeple’s affections without manipulating them? We have to be really intentional about that, because it’s so easy for well-meaning Christians to inadvertently manipulate a person’s affections for Jesus. And that’s wrong. When something other than Christ himself stirs your affections for Christ, your affections are disingenuous; they don’t honor God. It’s like people who sneak Oxitocin into their date’s drink to make them more affectionate. It’s not real. And so how do we do this? “When we encounter the word, and the word encounters us, we are affected” ([Voddie Baucham](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNcM2bAvqyY)). “I can’t say you don’t have to be moved, you just have to understand him perfectly. You don’t have to be moved, you don’t have to have any affections for him. That’s a God who’s half glorified.” If preaching aims to affections without truth, or truth without affections, it’s aiming to dishonor God. “I think if we preach to the emotions, that is, for the sake of emotions, just so that we can feel good about ourselves, that’s how we’re going to end up being manipulative. But I don’t think we should do that. We should preach about God, and as he’s being revealed, and the mind is able to comprehend who God is, then the emotions will follow.” Affections always follow truth. It never precedes it. “A preacher in Bolivia once did this excersize when I was there one time, he said ‘I’m really sensing the presence of God here. Amen?’ And then the crowd went, ‘Amen.’ And he said, ‘No, no, no, no, you don’t get it. He’s really here.’ And then the crowd went louder, ‘Amen.’ And then he said, ‘You don’t get it, God is really here!’ And people went just crazy and then he stopped and said, ‘You know what, I’m not sensing anything. You were just manipulated by me.’ And I thought that was a great exercise to show… he wasn’t saying anything about God at that moment. He wasn’t really presenting any great picture of about God. He was just moving the people according to their culture, and upbringing, that when you say this you say amen, and that’s what we need to guard against.”

I met a brother today named Mike, which Les had lifted up as on fire for God, predicting we would be two pees in a pod. When he entered into the car, I prayed for him 3 times that his chronic migraine might pass, but the thorn remained in his flesh. He patted my hands in an attempt to make me cease praying for him, with the consolation of saying, “You are a dynamic character, Ethan. I appreciate that.” I surrendered the front seat to him, knowing it is more award to be in the back, as he went on to speak to Les about his work at Building Bridges, where kids who aren’t excelling in the standard schooling system get more personalized, tailored, individual help. It’s a 1-on-1 education system. Being involved in the debate about replacing our generalized methods of educating kids today, I was in hardy agreement with shifting education from “one size fits all” to the individual learning styles and needs of each student, but I opposed with vigor his notion of enlisting a teacher for every standard deviation. “The expense must be very great,” I queried, as he remarked, “It is. Parents will pay as much as $40,000 a year to get their kids through.” It seemed unthinkable to me that it would be more preferable (or rather, more practical) to pay a teacher $40,000 for every standard deviation that occurs out of 80 million kids in the US rather than homeschooling them yourself, or offering other alternative education methods. Nevertheless, we digressed into his proposed solution, advocating that the state would pay for those children whose parents cannot afford the expense of their program, but whose children aren’t excelling in public school, which I harshly rebuked, saying, “It is not the state’s job to parent children,” as though it would be conceivable to mandate tribute upon the common man for the child of his neighbor. That’s communism. Let each man care for his own. Your child is not your neighbor’s responsibility. I’m not anti-compassion, but I am anti-compassion at gun point. Charity under duress is no charity at all, and every law is enforced at the end of a gun. Let acts of good will be out of good will; you cannot legislate compassion. The government’s job is to punish evil doers and otherwise stay out of the lives of it’s people. He said, “The problem is that we don’t value education is America,” to which I responded, “I don’t think that’s fair. All of us know the deep importance of education in maintaining progress in society. I think America cares very deeply about education, otherwise we wouldn’t send our kids to school, and send them off to college, and make them work hard and study hard to make it through. To say we don’t value education is insulting.” He said, “Well I can prove it. If we cared about education, teachers would be making more money, not $58,000 a year, while football stars make $40 million, actors make millions of dollars. What we care about in America is entertainment. We don’t care about education.” The thought of his argument was unduly incoherent to me. “Perhaps if there were only 30 teachers for a whole stadium full of students, they’d be making $40 million too. The difference is that every movie goes out to millions of people. Millions of people are the consumers. Your average teacher is responsible for 26 students. To sit there and say, ‘We don’t value education,’ because 26 people couldn’t pay their teacher $40 million dollars is absurd. Your average movie ticket is $10. The reason they make so much money is because it only takes one movie for millions of people to be on the receiving end of it. If millions of students could be on the receiving end of one teacher, he’d probably be making a lot more than that football star. Government spends over 100 billion dollars on education every year. We care about education in America. Don’t broad-brush us with your fish eye lens.” As conversation morphed over the ride, he was stiff-necked also with judgement against “the church” in America, saying, “As a pastor, I can tell you most Christians in America are consumer Christians, where 20 percent do the work, and 80 percent don’t. They have their list of complaints, too hot, too cold, bad carpet.” Being filled with anger at his generalized unrighteous judgement against the sheep in his flock and imposing their attitude on the whole of America, I spoke out against him, saying, “I can tell you my experience too, and it is a stark contrast from your pastoral career. In fact, every Christian I talk to agrees precisely with the problems of American church. Everybody I talk too ascents to the way God says the church should be in the Bible,” biting my tongue, though I wished to say, “and if you couldn’t get your people to see that, it’s a good thing you’re not a pastor anymore, because God’s word compels people, and if they aren’t compelled, you aren’t preaching God’s word,” and saying instead, “You talk so much about your people complaining, but who’s complaining now? It’s no wonder they complain—they get it from you.” When I challenged his extension of judgement from his 3 churches to broad brush America, he defended, “Well I talk to 50 pastors in the Plano area, and all the complaints are always the same.” Which struck me as odd. “So that’s what you pastors do when you get together? Complain about what all your people are complaining about? Log in your eye much?” The guard on my tongue would not allow such a statement out of my mouth, thankfully, for I would have regretted it. “If we had good churches in America, people like Francis Chan would not have been kicked out of his church.” “I was under the impression that he left because his name was more popular than God’s name in his church.” “No, they kicked him out because we didn’t want them to spend millions of dollars on church buildings, and wanted to move everyone outside.” “What’s your source for saying that?” “Things that he’s written.” I looked it up later, finding that he was spreading a false rumor against Cornerstone. He struck me as a man who sows discord among brothers, and I contended him at every point along the way. When he expressed his anger against churches for building a $10 million dollar building with $10 thousand going to missions, I said, “I used to think that too, until I realized that Solomon’s temple was very expensive.” Immediately he responded, “But that was different. God had specific designs for that building.” Moving on, we talked about the majority of Christians too little for the church, to which I responded, “I’ve looked at those studies, and they’re based on about 10 megachurches. You can’t use that as a micro-chasm for tends in America,” “Well they release scientific studies about this that…” “You say ‘scientific studies’ but it’s based on statistical fallacies that have nothing to do with science, and everything to do with taking one community, and using them talk about every community. That’s a logical fallacy, not science.” “Well they do a pretty accurate job of reporting trends in elections, and…” “Ha! You think they do a good job of reporting during elections? During our last election, more false news was reported than accurate news! That’s nonsense.” So we had a lot of disagreements, but at the end of the day, I labored to find common ground with him, and I saw him be humbled as he discovered that his views are not the only views. I heard him mock the public schools with Les, saying, “This little girl was called ‘Retard’ by the kids at school, and the mom called them, she was weeping when she called me, and she called them and they did nothing about it! They basically said, ‘Kids will be kids.’” To which I felt compelled to say, “Amen! It’s not government’s job to parent children. That’s the parent’s job. The way to address this is through the pulpits, not legislation. Paul said, ‘I have nothing to do with judging unbelievers.’” Though this is only a small fragment of our disagreements, I layed them aside to find some friendship with the man. At first, I judged him as a man who cannot be spoken to, because he is too stubborn in his own thoughts and was quick to render an answer without listening to the matter. But as I put him in his place, and overcame his arguments, he began to be humbled, and the tone of his voice dropped to the voice of a man that may be spoken to. He pastored an “Assembly of God” church.

That congresswoman says, “It’s astonishing that you would cut funding for kids that need help getting through school. The only reason I’m here now is because the government helped me go through school These kids need a shot too.” The notion that these kids do not have a shot at succeeding in life without the government stepping in and playing Mom and Dad is insulting, and it disgraces the men and women who know what it is to work hard. America is the land of opportunity, and if you are hard worker, you’re going to succeed. Drop outs succeed at life. The most renown lawyer in America was an independent researcher. Any child in America, if they want to be educated, if they want to acquire knowledge, and skills through knowledge, they have the worlds collective knowledge at their fingertips, on their phones, they can go to a library and do research there. There is no lack of resources in America for any student who wants an education to get a world class education for free. It’s insulting to me to hear you say that if somebody doesn’t teach you, you don’t have a shot. Every kid has a shot. Every child has the opportunity. The only thing it takes is a decision, not finding from government. And I’m happy to tell you that I went through college and learned more online than in the classroom, and most of my peers were the same way. We have programs like Khan Academy, YouTube Education, Veritasium, who are professional educators, who engage your mind, explain things really well, and in many cases, you can learn more from an 8 minute video on YouTube than half a semester at college, or at public school. Don’t tell me kids don’t have a shot without you stealing money from tax payers and giving it to so-called underprivileged children like a communist. They have the resources. If they want to succeed, they will. They don’t need you to waste money employing ineffective teachers (and they are ineffective—and many are also incompetent. Sorry, I know a lot of you personally). Whether you’re a kinesthetic learner, audial learner, visual learner, all the resources are at your disposal. You can climb out. Maybe in your day, you didn’t have what we have. But we have what we need now; let’s not use government money to provide a horse and buggy to kids who don’t have one. They already have a car. They have the internet. The collective knowledge of humanity. Promote that. Make people aware of their options.

If you will work hard, you will succeed. You say, “Well we don’t want kids to have to work hard to succeed.” That’s the problem. You know what motivates people to work hard? When they’re hungry. When you are hungry, you will work, you will sweat, you will do whatever it takes, and you will succeed. And if you won’t work, you’ll die from starvation, and so be it. If any man would not work, neither let him eat. You’ll find out pretty quickly that people aren’t going to sit around on there lazy butts if it means they starve. Hunger is a motivator. Elon Musk came from an underprivileged place in Africa. Africa! And looka t him now. If you will work hard, you will succeed, and these children don’t need your help. All they need is to reach out in front of them to everything that’s available, and if they will work hard, they’ll succeed. End of story. I mean honestly, what is it you want? You don’t want people to have to work to get somewhere in life? Name me one student who is completely out of options, and they’re working hard to get ahead in life, and they’re going to Libraries, and they have access to the internet, and they wake up early and go to bed late, and they don’t waste all their time playing video games, watching TV, and hanging out with friends, and looking at porn, and we will get together members from the church, and members from the community, and we will make a fund and pay for that person’s education. I don’t believe that person exists in America. And you know what? Then we’re going to pay attention to how these kids are doing, because then it’s our money that we’re giving to them, not our money that you’re stealing from us.

Is pornography permissible or not? Paul says, All things are permissible, but not all things are beneficial. That doesn’t sound right at all. Really? Such a gross sin is permissible? Adultery is permissible? Laziness is permissible? What does he mean by that? I explained to my sister Faith one time that permission means, “I’ll take the blame for it if it turns out mom and dad aren’t okay with it.” In other words, if it’s wrong, the condemnation goes to Ethan. What does a person feel when he does porn? Condemnation is what I felt. But at the same time, I read Romans 8, “There is no condemnation.” Paul is saying, “Look, no matter what you do, there’s no condemnation for those that are in Christ Jesus. And in that sense, all things are permissible. All things are free from condemnation. The law is fulfilled.” But what’s the second half of that clause mean? “Not all things are beneficial?” Look, even though you don’t get condemnation for that tattoo, something enables the Writer to say, “Let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us.” Wait—sin? I thought all things are permissible? How can I sin if it’s allowed? Notice, though, that we parallels it with “weight” in the middle of an illustration where you picture someone who’s running a race, and there are these little hindrances that cause him to stumble, or run slower, or basically not get to the front of the crowd. He doesn’t say our sin causes us to go to hell, he said it besets us. Besets us from what? Running the race that is set before us. Why do we care about running the race? Because it’s profitable to do things for the kingdom of God, and it’s profitable to know the riches of Christ in you while you’re on the earth, because those riches far outweigh your three seconds of miserable pleasure you get from masturbating. But if masturbating is permissible, does it hinder me knowing the fullest measure of the riches of Christ in me? My answer is yes, but in very careful yes. Does masturbating prevent you from entering into the throne room of grace with boldness? No, because your confidence is in Christ’s work on the cross, not your performance in walking out the righteousness he imputed to you. So how does my sin prevent me from knowing the fullest measure of Christ in me? Well, I think there are a couple of ways we can get at it, but I want to start in that verse: the sin which doth so easily beset us. Sin besets us. How? The more we sin, the more grace we have, so that as sin increases, grace increases in like proportion. So how can sin beset us? Maybe it’s just the simple fact that during the time we’re wasting walking in the flesh, we’re not doing the work of the Lord. But I don’t think that’s the answer, because then there would be no difference between committing adultery for an hour and playing video games for an hour. I think there has to be some residual effect of sinning that outlasts the duration of your sin. Even in Acts when the apostles said, “Only keep these four laws,” to the gentiles, there were still four things that they said, “Look, these things are really going to hinder them in the race and keep them from a profitable lifestyle.” Later, Paul doesn’t even follow those four rules, because he says, “Food sacrificed to idols are okay too.” But you have to be able to look at a sin, and say, “Is it profitable? Is it beneficial?” (Do you realize it’s God’s will for you to live a life that results in your own profit? Why? Because you’re profiting by doing work for God, so he’s the one paying you. You only pay an employee if they’re making a profit off of you. Your profit is God’s profit.) Why not? The effects of porn are this: it turns your brain to mush. It gives you brain fog, you can’t think as clearly, you don’t see woman the same way, it affects your sexual behavior. Are any of those things (which are all permissible) going to hinder your work for the Lord? It also makes you less happy. Look, even when there isn’t condemnation, that doesn’t mean there aren’t consequences. “You will be punished if you watch that show, because that’s a scary show, and it will give you nightmares.” “Ethan gave me permission.” Maybe you escape the punishment, but you’re still going to have the nightmares. So I think there is some nightmare consequence of sinning. What’s the consequence of a tattoo? I can’t think of one. What’s the consequence of adultery if no one finds out? (God is still going to punish you for sinning against other people. Christ’s work on the cross appeased us from the sin with which we sinned against God, but not the finite sins that we commit against people, that render us a finite punishment.) What’s the besetting of adultery if no one finds out? “Well, it’ll mess with your conscious.” Not if it’s permissible, remember? I feel like in some way, sin puts a wedge between you and God, but I can’t justify that in the Bible just now. I feel like it hinders your fellowship with God when you do porn and commit adultery. And God does discipline us on the earth, (it is written that he scourges every son that he recieveth), so how can Paul say, “All things are permissible?” If we get punished for sinning, than it’s not permissible. God did not allow us to do something that he will punish us for. If it’s allowed, there’s no punishment. But there is punishment, so how come Paul says, “All things are permissible?” What I want to know is how does sin hinder our walk with Christ?

I say, “I’ve got to get back to work,” and some people snarl, “Psh… work,” as they role their eyes, because it’s something like video typography or writing, but I think of it as work, because I’m doing it as unto the Lord. I picture myself as employed by him to do this. So I say with boldness, “This is my work.”

I would like to walk with Deborah somewhere, and make something right that I’ve made wrong. In all her letters to me, even for years, she is cautious to encourage me with the Bbile, because I am very critical about what it really means. It has paralyzed her from being able to really lean on the Bible, because I’ve made it out to be “her understanding of the Bible.” I hate making things a balance to be found, but if God’s promises don’t anchor you because you don’t know if you understand it correctly, then we will be tossed by the waves and waver with every wind of doctrine, which is what I was trying to prevent. But instead, I have caused it. I want to encounter God.

Dear brother in Christ,

There’s not a lot I can say that will really matter to you, so I won’t bother telling you what I have to say, and instead, let’s hear what God has to say.

As I sit here and think about what to write to you, I realize nothing I say will really matter in your life, but what God says will mean everything. I want to remind you and encourage you in the faith,

Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

I am caught between encouraging you about who you are in Christ, or spurring you on towards good works.

we are more than conquerors, I want to remind you that the same Spirit that raised Christ from the dead lives in you, and that you have him as the earnest of your inheritance. I wish I could

Dear brother in Christ,

The Bible says in

More grace dearly beloved of the LORD.

Everybody knows that relationships have a reciprocal affection. If you ask a little child, “Why do you put ice cubes in water?” he will tell you, “Because the ice makes the water cold.” That’s where a chemist will chime in, “Actually, it’s the water that’s making the ice warmer. Only heat can be transferred, not cold.” But everybody knows it makes the water colder to make the ice warmer. In fact, it’s the giving of heat, rather than the receiving of heat, that people are after. It’s the affection that happens when you are the one doing the work that people are after in life. You are affected by affecting others. Otherwise ice cubes wouldn’t be of any use. And I’ll tell you, there are some ice cubes in the world, but people look at them and call them bums. They look at them and call them worthless. The truth is we need ice cubes to make the thing with heat more enjoyable. It’s more blessed to give than to receive. Some people will take this and say, “Entropy is God’s parable of equality, that everything should be distributed equally. Even nature is set up that way.” Here’s the thing about entropy though: it pushes the universe towards a state of thermodynamic disorder. The more entropy does its thing, and heat spreads out equally across the universe, energy won’t be able to be used for anything. Because when heat spreads out equally, and it expands, it gets less dense, and when it’s less dense, it gets cold. And eventually, the universe will reach a point when it’s so spread out, that it will be as close to absolute zero as it can be. Equality is the most ultimate destructive force in nature, and it’s the most ultimate destructive force in government. It’s not the most powerful, the most quick, the deadliest, and sometimes we use entropy to make fires, to cool down drinks, and all of that, but in the end, when all is said and done, entropy will be the reason our universe goes to nothing. Entropy will win. And if we parrot that in government with communism, we’re going to see the same thing happen. We’re going to go to waste.

Holiness is like heat. It can’t be created or destroyed, it can only be transferred. The difference is that it doesn’t make God any colder to transfer holiness to us. He doesn’t lose heat by transferring it.

We ought to feel an urgency about the gospel, as though Christ were coming back this year. 2017. Let’s stop worrying about preparing ourselves, preparing our message, the harvest is plentiful. Let’s go reap.

“If my step hath turned out of the way, and my heart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to my hands, then let me sow and another reap, yea, let my offspring be rooted out,” and my offspring has been rooted out, because I’ve sowed, sowed, sowed, into my hands. God looks down from heaven and says, “Can a man conceive as a woman? Why then do I see every man with his hands on his loins?” God says, “That’s really stupid. Your semen is _for_ something.” And what’s another work for “_for_ something”? Holiness, right? Holiness means “it’s for something.” It’s set apart. God made it with the intention of being used a certain way. God looks down, and says, “Look, semen is for the purpose of having children, that’s what it’s _for_, so why am I seeing all these guys spilling it into their hands? Their hands can’t conceive.” And you look at Genesis 38, and it’s the same thing. Onan spilled his semen on the ground because he didn’t want his brother’s wife to get pregnant, and God killed him.”

That's not honest, sir. The Bible says all the weights of the bag are his concern. I wouldn't feel right charging them an arm and a leg for a corvet when they can get by in a corolla.

You ought to be really nervous when you talk in church. Not because, "Oh, what are people going to think about me?" but because you will be accountable to God for the things you say about him.

I know what it is to be a victim of the despair that comes from looking at your fruit to evaluate whether you're saved or not, and Martin knows what it is to be a victim of the sinfulness that comes from sleazy grace. "It doesn't matter… God will forgive me." The point is that we're both on the same side. We both want to spare people from the problems that we grew up with. We both have a heart for the things of God, and guiding people through the journey that we've taken. Neither of us just want to push our agenda and say, "Hey, I'm right and you're wrong." We care about people, and we care about what's true, and that is what is underneath both of our positions. In other words, the thing that we're aiming for is the same, we just disagree about how you get there. We're not opponants, we're brothers. Lorship salvation isn't a question of soteriaology, it's a question of what happens after you're saved, and how you can tell if people are saved. Eternal security is also not a question of soteriology (as he describes it), but a question of whether God will keep us from disbelieving the gospel after we've believed it. I think it denies scripture, but I also know that I thought eternal security denied scripture (like John 15) when I used to be a victim of legalism.

Martin wants to keep the law in focus, and make sure we don't preach against it. The whole book of Galatians is written to keep people from keeping the law at the core of what they do. You've traded it for something better, namely, Christ, and the fruits that come from walking in the spirit.

## Eternal Security / Lordship Salvation

After running into a Lordship Salvationist while I was serving on VN, I realized it's time to really drive the nail through and do a thorough research on eternal security, John 15, what it means to be slaves to righteousness, and all the objections I can remember to eternal security. The biggest one I remember being confronted with was that we are slaves to righteousness. I said, “Ah, but who’s righteousness?” In the words of Trey Gowdy, “Your heart may be in the right place, but this may be the dumbest idea I have ever heard”

I can’t have children. Why else would I get married? So that someone will cook for me, clean for me, share a paycheck? People don’t get married to share burdens, you get married to share a life. Life is children, and family, and vitality, and when you can’t offer somebody that, there’s no such thing as marriage. There’s just a contract that says, “Everything that’s mine is yours.” “Why can’t you have children?” God afflicted me, praise the Lord. God slapped me over the face and said, “Straighten up, son!” Sometimes we can get out of line, and my only comfort, listen o me, my only comfort, though I walk in the vallay of the shadow of death, is God’s rod and his staff. Because it leads me to paths of righteousness for his name’s sake. Sometimes God has to whack us over the head with a two by four to get us to walk two steps toward holiness, but if he just left us alone, we would be stuck in that valley forever. Look, if I want what I deserve, I go to hell. It’s true. That means that anything less than hell is grace. I’m alive. This isn’t just some cliché to help me cope with myself, this is life. This is unrestrained mercy. I should be burning in hell right now, but I’m not, because on calvery he who knew no sin was made to be sin for us, that we might be made the righteousness of God. And yet some people would look at me and say, “God did you wrong.” Shut up. You’re way late in the game. God did no wrong to me. And I trust him completely, and if I had to get disciplined because I was out of line for awhile, so be it, it’s because he loves me, the Bible says God scourges every son whom he recieveth, and he who spares the rod hates his son. “But don’t you want to get married?” Sure, but that’s an easy problem. I just deny myself. It’s simple. “You know, some people would be promiscuious because they can’t have children. Why don’t you sleep around?” What’s the point? Sleep around, get laid. Why would I do that? Do I think there’s pleasure in that? Maybe for like three seconds. But in the end, all who look for pleasure in fornication will open that harlot’s legs and find nothing. No pleasure. Sin promises pleasure, but it lies. The promises of sin are deception; that’s why Paul calls it the lusts of deceit, because it lies to you. God says, “Thou wilt shew me the paths of life, in thy presence is fullness of joy, at thy right hand there are pleasures forever more.” The lusts of deceit will let you down. God’s right hand will hold you up. Sleep around you say… why would I do that? There’s no gain. “Friends with benefits” they say. There’s no benefit. All things are permissible, but not all things are beneficial.

The Bible says to keep your house in order (1 Corinthians 14:40 – all things). “Well he just means keep order in the house, keeping your children from acting like animals and such.” Are you sure about that? Because this is the will of God we’re dealing with here, not some arbitrary assignment in debate class where our job is to be persuasive and offer a compelling argument. We will have to answer to God about what he meant. Many of us read the Bible as though, “If there’s room for my interpretation, then I can defend myself.” That’s not the way to read it. What’s true? It says we are to manage the house (1 Timothy 3:5). When Hezekiah was about to die, God said to him, “Set your house in order.” (2 Kings 20:1) The Bible says a righteous woman “looks well to the ways of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness.” And children, “Do all things without grumbling or questioning.”

You childhood is not meant to make you a reprobate. “Waste all your time while you’re young, because when you’re old, you won’t have it.” That’s nonsense. Childhood is not for kids to just do whatever they want, and have no responsibility, and never learn any principles of cleaning up, and doing your work, and excersizing discipline. The Bible says Jesus grew in wisdom, stature, favor with God and favor with men. Childhood is for development, not for Disney World.

People ask, “If your own child turned out to be a homosexual, would you hate them?” What they don’t understand is that they have the dynamic backwards. The only way somebody becomes a homosexual is if they hate God and he gives them up to a reprobate mind. If I raised my children in such a way as to neglect training them up in the ways of the Lord, that’s really when you hate your child. The Bible says he who spares the rod hates his son, and it’s that rod in which there is hope to save his soul. It’s the rod of correction that’s going to keep my child from hating the Lord and despising his commands. You say, “No, spanking them will make them hate it all the more.” And I’ve heard all that kind of propaganda, and it’s utter nonsense. The people who say that don’t know the beauty and goodness and peace that is in the commandments of God. Read Psalm 119 and you’ll see that. You’ll hear all about the people who actually followed them, and were raised to observe them, and you see how they ended up loving the commands. And that’s the way children end up when you raise them to obey God’s word. Would I hate my child if they became a sodomite? I would have to hate them for my child to become a sodomite. I would have to hate my child before he became a sodomite. So the answer is yes. There’s no way around that. But I would love my child, and therefore he wouldn’t be a sodamite, because I would teach him God’s word.

You don’t think that two consenting adults having sex in the privacy of their own home should be on the same level as somebody raping a child? Let’s say that you had a daughter. Now would you rather that this daughter had a girlfriend when she was 21, or was raped by a man when she was six? I would prefer the second alternative. You say, “That’s horrible!” Both options are horrible. But one of them has to do with circumstance, and the other has to do with personal choices. My daughter is not liable for her circumstances, but she is liable for her choices, and I would rather have a daughter who’s life has treated her unfairly than a daughter who degrades herself to that of an animal by having sex with another woman. The main reason is because the only way somebody gets homosexual is if they hate God, and God gives them up to a reprobate mind, and if you are rejected by God, you go to hell, because your heart has become so hardened you cannot believe in Christ for righteousness, and none of your sins are forgiven. I would rather have a daughter who’s sins are forgiven than a daughter who’s sins will be punished in hell for eternity.

“Homosexuality isn’t a choice.” I agree. It doesn’t eman it’s natural. The Bible says God gave them up to a reprobate mind. That means their minds were pulling at them, and they were on the edge, and they made a final decision to hate God, and God gave them over to that mind of theirs that was pulling them to be homosexual.

In my understanding, there’s eternal security, perseverance of the saints, and straight up Lordwhip Salvation, and they are all different things. Perseverence of the saints is sort of circular, because it says that if you are genuinely saved, God will make sure that you persevere. This really only works if you’re a Calvinist and subscribe to the notion that our free-will (if you can call it such) is ultimately determined by God. God “grants” you repentance, or else he might harden your heart, like Esau, etc. This doctrine offers assurance and comfort to people who don’t need it (that is, when you’re persevering in your faith) and no comfort when you do (that is, when you’re backsliding).

What I see in the parable of the sower is not a falling away from belief, but from following Jesus. This really confuses me. I see a perseverance that is necessary to be considered the “good seed.” I assume this parable has to do with salvation, but why is there so many people that got choked out by the worries of the world, or having no root, withered up and died? Is he talking about Christians that bear fruit and do good work on the earth versus Christians that get eternal life and then die and go to heaven without bearing fruit, or is he talking about the saved versus the unsaved? This is a heavy discussion that I don’t want to pass over. I also don’t want to approach it with confirmation bias, because I’m sure I can make the Bible say anything I want if I’m smart enough. If I think hard enough. I want to know what’s true, and I need you, Holy Spirit, to teach me. The thing about this parable is that it doesn’t seem to have to do with people who believe the gospel, and then stop believing the gospel, but with people who believe the gospel and then fall away from good works. I might be wrong; I don’t have the text in front of me right now. That’s one of the reasons I think a person must believe in eternal security to be saved. I personally know people who grew up in church, got baptized, participated in Sunday School and youth group with zeal, and then became a die-hard atheist. But if he believed and was saved, he has the Holy Spirit as the earnest of his salvation, even now. Which means he is still saved. Question: does a person who believes on the Lord need to persevere in believing on the Lord to be saved (that is, if he stops believing, he’s no longer saved), or is he still saved even after changing his mind, falling away from belief, and either trying to work hard to get to God or deny him altogether? James calls it dead faith that can’t save anyone if you look into the mirror, see that you’re sinful and forgiven, and then walk away and forget that. This all is very deeply interwoven twixt Calvinism, Eternal Security, dead faith versus living faith, and a bunch of other issues.

When I got saved, I don’t remember if my mom used a single verse, which makes me wonder if I got saved then, because faith comes by eharing, and eharing the words of Christ. If it’s the words of my mother, I have to believe my mom,a nd that’s where my faith is. I have to trust that she’s telling me the truth, versus if it’s from the Bible, I know it’s God’s words. Did I get saved? I don’t know. I prayed many times after that, and it’s hard for me to pin point, and I’ve made habits of praying, but I don’t want my experience with God to be the resting place of my assurance, because the ehart is deceitful above all else. If I didn’t get saved, I want to now. But I think I am. I know everything necessary to be saved.

Intrinsic in coming to Jesus is admitting that you need him. If you admit that you need Jesus, that means you aren’t good enough. Everybody looks good in certain lighting. Everybody looks good without their flaws exposed. But when the light came, men rejected the light because they wanted to look good. But to as many as received the light, they were given the right to become children of God. To as many as said, “Yes, Jesus, I am flawed, this is what I look like, I’m not good enough to work my way to heaven, I need help,” God says, “Those are the people who were given the right to become children of God.” If you say, “I need Jesus righteousness to cover me,” intrinsically you are saying, “My righteousness isn’t righteous enough.”

Some people want to wait until they read the whole Bible to decide if they believe it. The problem with that is that an unbeliever doesn’t understand the Bible, and they won’t understand the Bible until the Holy Spirit lives inside of them. The Bible is a spiritual book, and it is spiritually discerned. An unsaved person picks it up, and like the Ethiopian eunuch, “Understandeth what thou readest?” “How can I, except some man should guide me?”

Spoken like a true lukewarm Christian who hears the words of God and never acts on them.

Why is it that every intellectual Christian I trust is a Calvinist? Piper, Durbin, White, (Not Craig), Keller, Carson. What about Francis Chan? I don’t know.

Good night. Just about every doctrine that caused me to deviate from classical theology at my church was from the Bible that we used there, (NIV, then NASB), but none of them are in the KJV. “God isn’t omnipresent. It says they will be punished away from the presence of God.” (KJV: from, not away from). “We can keep the law, it’s just that we don’t. God said it’s not too difficult, not out of reach.” (KJV: it’s not hidden, nor out of reach). “God’s omniscience doesn’t include foreknowledge. The Bible says, “I expected good grapes, but only rotten ones sprang up. And again, after all these things, I thought they would return, but they did not return.” (KJV: after all these things I said, “Return,” and they did not return). “Christians can’t do habitual sins after they are saved, like pornography or fornication, or else that shows you never were saved. It makes manifest that you’re a child of the devil. The Bible says nobody who knows God continues in sin.” (KJV: Nobody born of God commits sin – i.e. it’s the old man, not the man born of God who does it.) But the biggest reason I switched is A. because KJV was more powerful, once I read it long enough to get used to the language (which was about 2 hours), B. the translators actually believed the Bible, which says things like, “I will preserve my words,” and God’s promise to have a perfect Bible, whereas these newer translators just say, “It isn’t perfect, but it’s very accurate. We changed the number here because it was probably a typist error.” And they use the newly discovered “dead sea scrolls,” wherewith God said, “I will preserve my word unto ALL generations, not hide it for a thousand years and let you figure out that what you had was wrong all along. And yet they use these scrolls over and against the TR. That’s faithlessness. They don’t believe God. And they certainly don’t believe there is a perfect Bible. It’s just a pretty good synthesis of thousands put together, and “by the way, all the variations are names and spelling differences and such, not theological differences.” Not if you treat the languages like a cafeteria with your lexicons, where you can pick and choose which definition fits your doctrine. There are significant differences in the English. So if you can tell me the Greek doesn’t contradict, why does all the newer translations if they are so “good”? And why are there such significant wording differences among translations if they aren’t there in the original languages? That just proves my point, that these newer translations are not faithful to the manuscripts, assuming that the manuscripts they are using is even faithful (which I don’t). There are so many problem texts that I got from being faithful to these faithless translations, because I was told, “They are the best ones, according to scholars.” So I decided, “Forget what the church says, I’m going to stay true to what I see in the Bible, to what God says,” and not once did anybody ever tell me, “Use a KJV.” They discouraged it. “Nobody understands that thing.” Than you have a carnal mind, my friend, because it’s your book that’s so confusing, and contradictory. You can learn to read basic syntax. That’s sad. And my faithfulness to God’s word lead me into all kinds of false doctrines, because it wasn’t God’s preserved word, it was man’s attempt to make it more understandable. It was man’s perverted words. Most of it was good. There’s enough to get saved reading these words. Maybe the Holy Spirit can use it. I don’t want to blaspheme the Spirit if he’s speaking through these translations. But what I am saying is that all it takes is a little bit of leaven to leaven the whole lump, and my view about God was leavened by these “minor” anecdotes of differing verses. “Well, they don’t matter, because the truth is in other verses.” Well they mattered to me, because I had to reconcile the whole things, and in order to do that, I had to do logical gymnastics, and it landed me in all kinds of false doctrine. I had to be faithful to the whole thing, and figure out how to make them work, and I did, and I ended up with false doctrines. All because of a handful of verses. And who knows what other problems other Christians are facing because of it. My sister read a verse out loud one time, “Nothing you do for God is ever useless.” I said, “That’s not true.” She said, “Yes it is. New Living Translation.” I was like, “Oh, that’s a verse?” to myself. But it still isn’t true. People do things for God all the time that are not only useless, but evil. They dishonor their parents (refuse to provide for them in old age) because whatever money they have is given to God. That’s _for_ God, but it’s not what God asked you to do. In fact, that’s disobeying what God asked you to do, because he said, “Honor your father and mother.” So these weird translations will really mess you up. If you are faithful to them. If you aren’t, who cares, right? You can make the Bible say anything you want if you pick and choose which verses suit you. I literally almost renounced Hebrews and James because they confused me once upon a time. But that’s another story.

The gospel is I but God, not God but I. It’s I sinned, but God saved me, not God saved me, but I have to live right. “Well it is both…” You are calling God a liar right now, and God’s not a liar. And if you think that he is, you don’t know God, which means you don’t have eternal life, and he’s going to say to you, “I never knew you.”

If I wanted to look good, the first thing to do would be shave my beard. But my beard tends to make people less intimidated of me, and I’m more about winning souls than breaking hearts, so it stays on my face.

You can call it confirmation bias, or you can call it being faithful to your first love, when you believed on Christ for righteousness, and now matter what, now you know that if you will be saved, it is God who will save you, not your many horses and swords. Not your righteousness. So what do you do with, “These sinners will not inherit the kingdom of God”? You can use confirmation bias to make an excuse and show that it means something like, “That’s the old man. Your corrupt flesh won’t enter.” That’s being faithful to your conviction. Or you can be faithful to the text and say, “That’s not what it sounds like it’s saying.” Same with 1 John. The child of the devil and the child of God are made manifest in this: the one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as he is righteous, and the one who practices sin is of the devil.

It’s not that these new songs are all about me, it’s that they’re all about relationship. “You don’t hide yourself from me. Your love is proud to be with me.” It’s still self-centered even though it’s God focused. “Your love never runs out of me.” What happened to the old hymns where it was just raw worship of a holy God who has done unsearchable things since the creation of the world? Worship isn’t our ascent that, “Yay, God made me able to have a relationship with him,” worship IS our relationship with me. Worship is us praising and enjoying God. But today, the word “relationship” has replaced the actual thing. Don’t get me wrong, I love singing, Oh How He Loves Us, but I feel like everything is all about us now instead of him, and it bugs me. I get it, you feel good, and you swear your not thinking about yourself in that moment, with tears running down your face and whatever else, but since when does any relationship begin the morning saying, “You love me,” instead of, “I love you”? I mean, God has said it, he doesn’t need you to repeat it, he wants you to become it. Tell a lost and dying world that God so loved them that he sent his son. That’s how you tell God, “I love you too,” because Jesus said, “If you love me, you’ll keep my commandments.” And besides that, “worship leader” today sounds like they’re making copulatory vocalizations in front of the church. Their voices glorify themselves, because they sound so good. There are some voices that are only fit for the bed room. Get out of the ears of the church. It’s like you’re trying to sound sexy on purpose. “Burning bright for me.” Pieces by Amanda Cook. I’m going to call her out right now, she has no business making those sounds in worship. And everybody tries to imitate that kind of “passion.” You know what, though? It’s the same passion that all the secular artists are using to talk about sex, and nakedness, and all manner of lasciviousness. Disarm You by Illumeum is less sexy than these so-called worship songs. Get them out of our ears, Christians. Don’t listen to them.

There were about 383 Midianites for every one Israelite in Gideon’s army. If you were one of those guys, you had to have been 100% sure that it was God who was going to deliver you, because there was no way they were going to do it on their own. Versus the people who were too afraid, they might have said, “Yeah, I know God is with us, but I’m just not good enough to beat these guys.” They still trusted a little bit in themselves. It’s the Jesus+ gospel. They thought that they had to be strong enough, or train hard enough, or be good enough to beat the Mideanites. And that’s exactly what a lot of people do with Jesus. They say, “Yeah, I know it’s Jesus who’s going to fight for me, who’s going to be my justification, but I still need to train hard and be good enough, or I’m going to die.” “Those Midianites are going to kill me if I’m not good enough, God or no God.” That’s fear. That’s doubt. That’s the opposite of faith. And that’s the reason most Christians are going to hell. Because they believe in the Jesus+ gospel. They think it’s Jesus plus work.

There are a couple of fundamental things to understand when you’re trying to break a porn addiction. The first is that you aren’t sinning. You aren’t sinning. Don’t believe me? It’s what the Bible says. 1 John 3:9, “Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.” You say, “Wait a minute, 2 chapters ago he just said, whoever claims to be without sin deceives himself and the truth is not in him. What gives?” Here’s the dead: It’s Romans 7:17, “Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.” You are born with a sin nature, certain automated behaviors that are wired in your biology, and Paul doesn’t really identify with them. Why? Because one day it will pass away, and you will no longer be burdened with that sin nature. It will cease to exist. The neurological impulse that you get when your eyes see a naked women, and chemicals fire up in your brain, and blood flows to your loins to nudge you along in reproducing will no longer exist when your body dies. Sin is grounded in the flesh, and your flesh is on its way out. It isn’t you. So the first thing to know is that you are perfect. God doesn’t look at you walking in the flesh and say, “I hate that guy.” It’s true that h hates the workers of iniquity, but he doesn’t hate you, because you aren’t working iniquity. Why? Because it’s no longer you who do it, but sin living in you. So you don’t have to feel distant, far off, and alienated from God when you sin. That’s fundamental. You are tight. You have a common enemy with God: your flesh. “Oh dear God, he just beat me again. Train my arms for battle that a bow a steel might be broken by mine arms.” The second thing that comes from not beating yourself up when you sin, and not getting down and depressed and in this self-pitying cycle of greif and ungodly sorrow that leads to remorse is that it opens you up to the kind of attitude that is determined to work hard. If you’re depressed, you don’t wake up in the morning with a vigor that’s going to drive you through the day. You might not wake up at all. You sit there in bed and say, “Why are you downcast, oh soul? Hope in the Lord.” And you roll over on oyur bed, you never want to get up, and that makes you even more depressed because you aren’t doing anything. But when you realize, “No, that wasn’t me, that was my enemy, and God is for me, and God will help me fight in this war,” you can jolt up out of bed with power. “Today is a new day.” “He teacheth my hands to war that a bow of still is broken by mine arms.” “It doesn’t get easier, but I get stronger.” Here’s what you have to know: God will get the sin out of your life when you get to work for him. This is Genesis 4:7, “If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? And if thou doest not well, sin liath at the door.” Idle hands are the devil’s workshop. If you’re being lazy, or you’re doing slack work, temptation is going to lay at the door waiting for you. All the time is an opportune time when you’re not busy doing something. But the main reason we believe this is that it’s something God said. If thou does not well, sin liath at the door. Get to work. Don’t believe me? John 15:2, “Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.” When you get to work for the Lord and start soul-winning, God’s going to prune the sin out of your life. Plus, when it comes to the gospel, it’s use it or lose it. When you’re out there preaching the gospel, that keeps it fresh in your mind. Every time you preach it afresh to somebody new, it’s a reminder to yourself that it’s all by faith, not of works. When you have the things of God in the forefront of your mind, you’re not asleep with your guards down; you’re sobar and vigilant against your adversary, the devil, who prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. Plus when you arm yourself with the feet of readiness, you know you have the sword of the spirit, because you’re constantly using scripture to give people the gospel. But the main thing is, that if you’re faithful to do this text, God will be faithful in his part. He’s going to purge the sin from your life, like deadweight off of a tree. That’s how you beat sin. Get to work. And you can’t get to work if you’re down in the dumps, wallowing in oyur sin, wondering how displeased God is with you, and how much he hates you. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying that there isn’t a godly sorrow that leads to repentence, but you have to be very careful to distinguish it from the worldly sorrow that leads to remorse. It’s a sorrow with God, instead of a sorrow towards God. There’s a comerodity with Christ in your defeats (that’s a loose way of saying it). “The enemy just made advances again, but we’ll get him.” “It’s been a long time coming, but God will deliver me.” We have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmaties, but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Therefore let us come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need. Notice that the verse uses a sense of comradity as the bases for being bold when you enter into God’s throne room. It’s not that you’re guiltless, it’s that Jesus gets it. Jesus was tempted too, and he’s right there advocating for us before the Father. “Ah man, he faced a tactical defeat, but one day he’s going to be changed in the twinkling of an eye, and all of God’s enemies will be put under foot.” There’s the presence of God that’s central in these verses. And if you aren’t entering into God’s throne room to commune with him, you want have a determined attitude, and you won’t do well in your work, because you won’t have joy. In thy presence is the fullness of joy. These things I have speken that my joy might be in you. It’s all centered around having joy from the communion with God that we can enjoy because Christ has perfected us. We’re wearing his righteousness. We can talk about our flesh behind it’s back. Treat it as a separate entity from you, because it is. You say, “How can I hear its thoughts in my mind if it isn’t me?” Same way you can see through your eyes. It’s not you, but you’re connected to it for the time being. One day you’ll lose it, and you won’t see through those eyes anymore.

I’ve always known that most Christians aren’t saved. The hard part was trying to figure out which ones it were. I was ready to through my brother under the bus after a Francis Chan video, and ready to throw Francis chan under the bus after a steven Anderson video.

We like to get all technical about, “Well, you have to believe this.” Or, “You have to believe that.” “You have to believe in eternal security to be saved.” “You have to believe the trinity.” “You have to believe in zero works to be saved.” “You have to make him your Lord to be saved.” “You have to affectionally embrace the gospel as a treasure to be saved.” “If you get it, you’ll sell everything you have and live for heaven. If God makes these promises, and we believe them, then we would live differently.” And on and on and on. But the Bible is simple. “If you confess with your mouth, ‘Jesus is Lord,’ and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.” That’s factual. That doesn’t seem right at all. Don’t you have to call on the name of the Lord? Don’t you have to put all of your trust on him? But it’s a simple statement. A simple promise. If you do these two things, you’re saved. Do we believe it or not? And then later, when Peter and Paul are preaching the gospel, they aren’t very meticulous to make sure their converts understand everything. You don’t see them explaining eternal security, or any of that. It’s just a quick, “Believe on Jesus.” “Okay.” When did Christianity become so complicated? I get complicated doctrines. But salvation? Infants receive it while the wise don’t understand it.

How do you know if someone is saved? There are three that bear witness in earth: the Spirit, the water, and the blood. But wait a minute—bear record of what? And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. The water and the blood is the witness of men, and the Spirit is the witness of God. What is it witnessing? That eternal life is in Jesus Christ. Baptism and communion isn’t about “Professions your faith,” so that people can tell that you’re saved. They are about bearing witness in earth that eternal life is in the Son of God.

In order to believe in divine inspiration you have to believe in some form of Calvinistic intervention of free-will. If holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, and we say, “Without error,” and, “The words of God,” then God must have intervened in their ability to make mistakes. God stepped inbetween their freedom of speech, as it were, in certain times. Does that mean it was God who made David choose to fornicate with Bathsheba? Of course not. God doesn’t eliminate free-will by taking away some of our choices. For example, none of us can fly. “Oh! How dare God intervene with my free will.” You still have free will. When God took away Adam’s ability to eat from the tree of life, he took away the freedom of choice. One choice. He didn’t take away all choices. Sometimes God intervenes in our choices, and sometimes God intervenes in our options, but he nevertheless gives us free will in everything else. It would be foolish to try and synthesize the two, saying, “God controls our free will decisions.” That’s nonsense. It’s doublethink.

The porch? Nah. The porch is like, hyper-emotionalized. Emotionalism is for babes in Christ, not the mature who desire meet in place of milk. I mean, as you mature, do you get excited about every little thing? “You got a raise.” “YES!!! Finally! Woo-hoo!” No, you’re like, “Alright. Thanks.”

The question is not, “Are you filling your time with something?” Everybody’s filling their time with something. The question is, “Are you being wise with your time?” It’s not just about doing work. It’s about doing work that matters. Work that’s useful to the world, or somebody in it.

That would be like asking, “What are the ingredients to this food?” and responding with, “Well, it has 16 grams of potassium, 2 grams of carbohydrates,” etc. No, that’s the nutriants, not the ingrediants. I could pile up all the right nutrients, but it still won’t give me the right recipe. There’s more than one container of potassium, fiber, and so on.

I don’t like to press illustrations farther than they were meant to go, but I think there’s something to be said that fruit is the excrescence of a very profound love. The reason we are alive today is because our parents loved each other. And so there is a sense in which we bear fruit for God because we love him. Jesus said if you love me you’ll keep my commandments.

“I was a KJV only for like 6 months, and then after researching it I found that there was no justification for it. So people will say God will preserve his word, and the KJV has been the standard for the last 400 years. Okay, well by that same token, let’s just all read the Latin Vulgate. That was the standard in the church for 1,100 years. So why should we replace something used for 1,100 years with something that’s been used for 400 years? It just doesn’t make any sense.” ~ [Steven Bancarz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPp1SuQOO9g)

You don’t have to be personally attracted to somebody to know that they’re attractive. I have absolutely sero attraction to any man on earth, and yet I still have a sense of who is attractive and who’s not as attractive. We all do. We can walk by a mirror and say, “Whoa! I’m way handsomer than that.” We know when it’s our off days. It’s not because we’re attracted to ourselves.

Who’s spiritual growth are you interested in besides your own?

I’ve realized that I’ve given my life to my computer and phone. To my computer for the work of knowledge, and to my phone for the work of discipline. Now they are taken away and I do not pray for what will cause me to sin. Let it be purged, and I praise God for pruning me. What fruit have I born? Yet God is gracious to purge these stumbling blocks from me eyes. If my own sight was taken from me and by that cause I lived a more godly, more fruitful life, than by all means, let it be done. What matters in this life? My math is in heaven, but me heart has been on the earth. I say, “It is a better treasure in heaven, and the things of God are greater,” yet all of my time is spent in rebellion, even hypocrisy to that very confession. What have I done for the Lord lately? I am a fruitless branch. And if my computer is revived, I want be devoted to the ministry of God’s work, not the work I do _for_ God. “Contraband,” the man said, who would not honor his parents because the money which would have been for the oldness of their age was given to God. Yet God said, “Honor thy father and mother,” thereby showing his work to be rebellion. The man did not keep his money from greed, but rather gave it to God. He used it _for_ God. Yet even by this work he did not obey the voice of the Father. So to is all of my work, which I toil under the sun. I am unwise by the time I’ve given to this work. I plan to refine it, though maybe not to give it up. I should have a job. If I had no computer, no phone, I would surely have one at this time. The reason I don’t pursue a career is because I’m not socially prepared for it. I’m not confidant in my ability to specialize in a skill. Nor do I know what skills I have the aptitude to master. Programmer? CPA? Lawyer? I can write an amazing speech, but it’s a flip of the coin to whether I deliver it well. Verbatim sucks, and concept delivery is good, but that depends on the wisdom I have from God, which I sometimes sacrifice to the god of my stomach, wretched man that I am. I’m obsessed with recording the things I say, think, and promise. I don’t want to forget the wisdom God sometimes graces me with. Yet these records destroy me. They ruin the moment. They turn away God’s face from me. It is good that God has taken them, if indeed God has taken them. If not, perhaps God will use for good what chance meant for evil.

## Tattoos

The classical argument in favor of tattoos is that when that command was written, tattoos were used as an act of Pagan worship, and so what God really meant was not to worship false gods by marking up your skin. And I’ve heard people ask the question, “So what if we did that to worship God?” And my answer is that you can’t worship God by disobeying him. A lot of people think that, “It was a Pegan ritual” is an argument that justifies getting a tattoo. But that logic is non sequitur. It doesn’t justify breaking the command, “You shall not make any tattoo marks on yourself” by pointing out that evil people used to do it. Cultures back then would also sacrifice their child to Moloch, and God said, “Don’t do that.” That doesn’t mean God wants you to sacrifice your child to him. It means what it means: don’t do it. And a lot of people just want to resist the Bible, and I come across that every week in Sunday School, where people just dance around theological strip poles, (and they shed off every good doctrine, and every scripture they don’t like) shedding every good scripture and casting it behind them because they don’t like it. “It has to be in context.” “Proverbs aren’t commands.” “This commentator that I respect said it’s a common mistake when people treat proverbs as promises.” Well I have a friend that I respect too, his name is the Holy Spirit, and he is speaking to all of us right now that all of scripture is God-breathed and profitable for correction, reproof, exhorting, and admonition.

## Bible Authority / Rejecting Scripture

Amy attempted to annihilate my argument that we shouldn’t look at alcoholic wine by dismantling the authority of the book of Proverbs. She said, “You can say that it’s not wise to drink, but you can’t make the argument that it’s sin to drink wine.” Of course I can. The Bible says the thought of foolishness is sin. But it gives us the command: don’t look at the wine when it is red. You say, “It’s not a command; it’s advice.” Um, did God say it? “It’s literature.” It’s God-breathed. God is responsible for that. This is how God wants us to live, and if we choose to ignore God’s will for us, that’s sin. It’s sinful to hear God say, “Don’t look at the wine,” and answer him, “No, I think I’ll have a drink anyway.” If God says, “Do this,” and we don’t do it, aren’t we disobeying him? “Proverbs is written in the dynamic of, ‘If you do this, than x result will happen.’ It’s not saying we have to do this.” Who said that, God or somebody? What your teacher is saying, is that generally in the book of Proverbs, when he says, “Train up your child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it,” that’s a principle, not a promise. It’s wise to do that, but it isn’t without exception. But listen, you have to find that in the passage. What your teacher is doing is he’s making a generalization, but you can’t impose that generalization on the whole book. You have to find it precept upon precept, line upon line.

Abby said, “You’re taking that out of context.” What’s the context? Who’s he talking to? He’s talking to people who haven’t tried mixed wine, and he’s saying, “Avoid that; here’s how.” Usually when people say, “That’s out of context,” they mean, “God gave a reason for his command.” But it’s still a command. It’s formatted as an imperative. God explaining to us why he doesn’t want us to look at fermented wine is an act of grace. Sometimes your parents tell you why, sometimes they don’t. God wants us to submit whether we know the why or not. And when he tells why, we twist it to say, “Well, see, God’s just giving advice here. He isn’t commanding us anything.” That’s wicked. What’s your argument? How does the context relate to the imperative statement in verse 31, “Look not thou upon the wine when it is red”? Lively argument goes too quickly to persuade anyone.

Just because a characteristic is immutable doesn’t mean it doesn’t matter. All the differences between dogs and homo sapiens are immutable—unchangeable. You say, “No, the difference is in behavior.” Dogs don’t get rights by virtue of their good behavior. They get privileges. And they can give them up by sabotaging that good behavior.

Paul said, “God judgeth them that are without. Do not ye judge them that are within?” And he’s talking about throwing people out of church. He says, “there’s a fornication among you that exists not even among the gentiles. For a man has his mother’s wife.” Right? But what he’s saying is that Gos has made it our job to judge them that are within the church. We don’t have any business judging unbelievers, but when it comes to our brother’s in Christ, we’re supposed handle that sin. And God has made it our God to judge believers. And the Bible says, “He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both are abomination to the LORD.” We have a responsibility to God to judge with righteous judgement, and when we just turn a blind eye, and justify the wicked, we’re an abomination to God. That’s what the Bible says: he that justifies the wicked is an abomination to God. You say, “Well Jesus justified the wicked.” (No, he justified the faithful. But you’re right: believers needed a substitutional atonement because we were wicked.) Yeah, ontologically. Not just in judgement. He didn’t just acquit the guilty, he made us righteous by imputing his own righteous to us and bearing our sin on the cross. But when we neglect right judgement in condemning the wicked, we’re neglecting a a responsibility that we will be held accountable to God for. A lot of times we don’t think about how we will answer for our sins because we have a savior who paid for them all. But God says that we are to judge them that are within, and he hates false judgement. You can’t just acquit everyone and say, “It’s not my place to judge.” God says, “No, I’ve made it your place to judge. And anyone who is a fornicator, covetous, a railer, an extortioner, or an idolater, throw them out of the church.” And Paul said, “I have judged already.” You say, “Judge not.” “Judge not lest ye be judged, for with the same measure of judgement you use, so too is will be measured unto you.” Sorry to confuse you with the whole passage.

If you’re attempting to shut someone up, speak quickly. They won’t be able to follow, and they won’t want to admit it. If you’re trying to persuade someone, speak slowly. They’ll listen to you. If they are stubborn, and they can’t process what you’re saying, it’s like talking to a brick wall. You give an argument, and they just blow it off without even addressing it. To argue well, you need to diagram their arguments, and walk them through it slowly. You can’t rush changing somebody’s mind. You can rush sounding smarter than people, but not to a stubborn person. All you will achieve with a quick tongue is frustration. It’s irritating when people just outright reject the Bible. And I don’t think they are saved when they do that.

How can James show you his faith by his works if the works of the perfect law of liberty is Believing on the Lord Jesus for salvation?

The gospel of Jesus Christ is about Jesus, it’s not about you. ~ [Steven Anderson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bTlvbkRXys&list=LLBkWJNMdlBmY0zh6VArtv4Q&index=170)

Context doesn’t just contradict what a given verse is saying. Context is only useful for a limited number of questions: Who’s he talking to? Who does this apply to? Is the writer being sarcastic? You can’t just say, “This verse isn’t true because it has a context.” “Context!” “Context!” That’s the catchphrase of people who just want to reject God’s word. Context is good for establishing (1) who is talking, (2) who he’s talking too, (3) does it apply to me. You can’t just reject God’s word under the guise of “Context.” Jesus said, “They hear not God because they are not of God.” And if you refuse to hear God, that can only mean that you’re not of God, you’re a wolf in sheep’s clothing, and I don’t want to have anything to do with you until you repent and believe.

Why am I unemployed? I was listening to Francis Chan one time, and he said, “Don’t go to work tomorrow if you’re not on fire for God. Don’t go to work until you’ve just fasted and prayed, ‘God, I’m not on fire for you, get me on fire for you.’ What else matters?” And I heard him say that, and I thought, “That makes a lot of sense. I won’t get a job until I’m on fire for God. I’ll seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and then these things will be added unto me. But I need to make the things of God more important than the things of man, and I need to work on getting my heart right before I go to work, because that’s more important. That’s my priority. Unfortunately I didn’t realize Francis Chan was a false prophet at the time, and so I listened to him instead of God who says, “If thou doest well shoult thou not be accepted, and if thou doest not well sin lieth at the door.” And so I took all this time off to get sin out of my life, to train myself to win souls, and I’m only now realizing, as I’m talking to you, that, “No, I need to go to work.” I haven’t thought about this is awhile.

The title of my lesson tonight is called, “The Least In The Kingdom of Heaven.”

You want to teach people drinking is okay when the Bible says, “Don’t even look at it.” You say having a tattoo is okay, when the Bible says, “Don’t get a tattoo.” And when the Bible says, “Lean not on your own understanding,” you use your own understanding to explain away and justify these sins, and teach people that it’s okay to do them. And your understanding goes like this: well, Paul said meat is okay when the Old Testament says it’s not okay, so we can do the same thing as Paul and realize that not everything in the Old Testament is still binding. But listen, Paul didn’t make it okay to eat unclean foods. God did. God said to Peter, I have cleansed them, and this rule is overruled. Only God can amend his law. Paul can’t, and we can’t. And so you can’t just say, “Well Paul had the authority to dismantle some of God’s old rules, so we do too. And look, oh the culture was so bad back then, therefore it’s okay to do the things they were doing now.” That’s a new level of stupidity. “The reason the Bible calls child sacrifice an abomination is because many cultures back then would sacrifice their children to the false-god Moloch. So it’s not that child sacrifice is wrong, it was just the culture back then abused it by offering their children to Moloch.” “Yeah, tattoos are okay. When the Bible says don’t get a tattoo, it’s talking about some cultures back then that would worship false gods with tattoos.” You’d have a better chance at justifying child-sacrifice with that argument, because at least the Bible actually says, “This is a pagan practice.” It doesn’t say that about tattoos. It says, “Don’t make cuts for the dead, or get a tattoo, I am the Lord.” How do you get: “Tattoos were a pagan practice” from that? Oh somebody told me. Yeah, somebody said “abba” means “daddy” too, and that got real popular real fast, and it’s still circulating, and it’s false. Abba does not mean “daddy.” If you want to go around teaching people to break on of the least of these commandments, you can do that, but Jesus said you will be called the least in the kingdom of heaven if you do that, and I am here to give you a sincere warning about that. You’ve heard this from the Bible. You can listen to Jesus or not, take it or leave it, but I’m out, I’m not going to beat this elephant, the Bible says, “The beginning of strife is like letting out water, so abandon the quarrel before it breaks out.” Accept my admonition or not, it isn’t what God thinks of me on the line here. This is between you and him. I don’t have a tattoo, and I’m teaching you not to have a tattoo. I’ve said what the Bible says, you’ve said what people say. My job is done. The world hear’s you because you’re of the world.

I’ve heard many baby Christians, and even pastors try to disavow the authority of the book of Proverbs by saying, “Well, proverbs are principles, not promises.” And when you bring up a command, or an imperitive form proverbs, they’ll say, “Well that’s just advice for living a good life. God doesn’t actually command us not to look at wine when it is red; he is just saying it would be wise not to look at the wine when it is red. That’s all it is.” Okay. That’s what your commentary says aobut it. Let’s look at what the Bible says about the book of Proverbs: Jesus said in Matthew 15:4, “For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.” That is a direct quote from Proverbs 20:20. Jesus said, “God commanded,” and then quoted a proverb. You can’t say this is just a book of advice. These are commandments of God. It’s also helpful to note that Jesus ascribes the book to God. God wrote it. And if God says, “Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it,” than that’s true. There’s not an exception to the words of God. You can treat them as promises. Name one person who was trained up in the way they should go, and they departed from it. You can’t do it. You say, “Solomon’s son Rhemboam.” Solomon didn’t train him up in the way he should go. You know how I know that? Because God said if you do that, they won’t depart from it when they’re old. And God’s always right. Either God’s right or you’re wrong. And if you resist the words of God, get out of this church, you wolf. We do not need you to leaven this church with your heresies. There’s the door, don’t let it hit you on the way out. Jesus commanded us to be as wise as serpents because of people like you infiltrating our churches. And Paul said the way you can tell who’s of God is if they hear God’s words. And Jesus said the same thing, and if you’re resisting the words of God, get out. This is a place for people of God, not unbelievers and people of dead faith bringing in damnable heresies. “Walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called, with all humility and gentleness, with patience, showing tolerance for one another in love, being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.” But make no mistake, we have no unity with the unbelieving. What fellowship does the light have with dark? We’re the lights of the world. That’s not something the world likes. Because the world is in darkness, and they reject the light because their deeds are evil. And the darkness has no fellowship with the light.

And in John 7:38. Jesus said this: “He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.” Now that’s an allusion to Proverbs 18:4, and Jesus treats it as a promise. Consider these other passages that treat proverbs as truths, not principles: Rom 2:6 = Pro 24:12, Rom 12:16     = Pro 3:7, Rom 12:20 = Pro 25:21-22, 1Th 5:15 = Pro 17:13, Jam 2:1 = Pro 24:23. Hebrews calls Proverbs the exhortation (Hbr 12:5-6, Pro 3:11--12). Again, James affirms that the author is God (Jam 4:6, Pro 3:34). Peter treats a proverb as a promise (1Pe 4:8, Pro 10:12). And watch what Peter says in 2 Peter 2:22: But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.” He’s quoting verbatim Proverbs 26:11. How can a principle be true? Ask that to your “Bible professor”. And you know what? We should avoid theologians anyway. “Oh, he’s just saying like we say all the time: that’s so true man!” No, the Bible is not that loose with its language.

Consult (confer) not with flesh and blood. You’re being backed by a commentary, and I’m being backed by Jesus. You lose. And you can win the minds of these people hearing us, but if anyone doesn’t hear God, he is not of God. And the Bible says the world hears you because you’re of the world.

The doctrine of the reprobate is a really important doctrine, because loving them that hate God seems like you’re erring on the side of “love everyone,” just n case, but the Bible treats it as a sin. I mean imagine. These are people that hate God. They hate God. They don’t want to have anything to do with him, but you want to look over and way, “I love you. I approve you. I care about your well being.” God look at you and says, “Wait a minute—they hate me.” Jeremiah 16:5, God says, “Don’t enter a house of mourning for them that are rejected of God.” Inj other words, everyone that’s going to hell, and you gave them the gospel, and they rejected it, don’t grieve that they’re in hell when they die. I don’t think we understand how wicked it is to reject the Lord Jesus Christ. People go to hell for it. But you want to be sorry that they are in hell. God says, “No, don’t mourn for them.” And yet we say, “Love everybody.” Approve everybody. Love pedophiles. Love child molesters. Love homosexuals. These are the people that God has given up to a reprobate mind, and the Bible is clear, they are unnatural affections. It doesn’t come from your sin nature, it comes from you going through a process where you hate God, you hate what he stands for, and God rejects you. So you can look at someone with unnatural desires, and you can say, “You hate God, and God has rejected you, and therefore you are my enemy, and I hate you. I wish nothing but destruction on you.” And I know it’s a hard word. It’s not natural for me to just hate people. But God says to do it, so we should do it. You say, 1 Cor. 6 says homos can be saved. No, it says “” can be washed. Homosexual is like butterfly. That’s not what the word literally means, and it’s no accident that these new libral versions translate it that way, because they want to push this doctrine that it’s never too late for anyone. Hebrews 6. It is.

And that’s why it’s important to have a translation that’s faithful to the text, because these newer translations will take away doctrine.

You don’t do what you know people will appreciate you for, you do what you know will make people happy, and if people don’t express their appreciation, you don’t know if your help is a preferable service over and against letting them do it themselves. Appreciation isn’t selfish. Appreciation is what tells you, “This is how I can make this person happy, and I want to do that again.” Never demonize that.

Where is the perfect word of God? You see, most textual critics that I’ve had the pleasure of meeting and talking to, or reading up on say that there is no perfect Bible. They say, “Well, every English version has its mistakes.” Well what about the underlying? Where’s the perfect Bible? And they say, “We have 21,000 manuscript fragments, and some really old manuscripts from right after the life of the apostles.” The Textus Receptus is the perfect word of God. It’s from when one of the smartest people on earth names Erasmus challenged the Latin Vulgate and took collated many manuscripts from the majority text into one book. Newer versions are based on this fraud discovered in the 20th century called the dead sea scrolls. … but we want to know, “Where is the perfect word of God?” And “Is there a faithful translation of it into English?” I believe there is good reason to think that God was involved in putting his word perfectly into English. Uniquely English. Not every language yet has a perfect translation of God’s word, but English does. You say, “Show me that in the Bible.” First we’re going to look at examples of God preserving his word into other languages, (including the evidence that Jesus spoke Arabic, but the originals were written in Greek, showing that even the original texts were translations), then we’re going to look at evidence specifically for the global language we now speak. Modern understanding of Bible translations is an “Eat right for your blood type” kind of philosophy. We think, “Well, whichever translation is easiest for you to read, that’s the one you should stick with. Just whichever one you like the most.” But is that a good piece of advice? Or is that what the Bible says? But as far as I know, there’s nothing in the Bible that predicts a global language, or that suggests God would translate his word into English. It makes logical sense, but the Bible says lean not on your own understanding. The reason I say KJV is because every time I do a word study, the KJV says exactly what the underlying says, while the NASB or ESV deviates. I’ve never found a mistake in the KJV, but I’ve found plenty of mistakes and inconsistencies in these so-called more scholarly versions. But I don’t think we need to speak Greek to have the perfect word of God. There is almost as much reason to believe God would preserve his word perfectly into English as there is to believe he would preserve it perfectly into Greek, because the original words were probably in Arabic (concerning the words of Jesus). The only difference is that they were penned down by the apostles, who were moved by the Spirit. As far as I know, there’s no scriptural reason to be a KJV onlyest, but there are practical reasons for being one.

There is no argument for the King James that I can’t use for the Latin Vulgate.

I’d rather be correct than persuasive.

Why is it important that we don’t treat a paraphrase of the Bible as God’s words? Anything other than perfect is a paraphrase. Because God’s words are perfect, and if it’s not perfect, it’s not the words of God, it’s the words of men. The Pharisees tried to elaborate on God’s law, and Jesus said they didn’t have the authority. The Pharisees thought they could put the law into their own words to make it more understandable, and that’s exactly what these new versions are doing.

What translation are you reading from? No, you don’t get to read from the NLT and say, “This is what the Bible says.” The King James is more faithful to the Greek than the NASB, and that’s why it’s difficult for many people to understand. The English is not hard. It’s the preserved Greek syntax that’s hard in the KJV. You don’t get to read from the ESV and correct the KJV.

Would you read _____. Read it one more time. Did you guys notice how it said _____? And this is a perfect demonstration of why it’s important to have a word-for-word translation, because when we leave it up to the translators to elaborate for us what a passage means, it’s no longer a spiritual book discerned by the Spirit living in us, it’s a carnal book that’s carnally discerned. It deprives us of deciding for ourselves what the words of God mean. We hear the echo instead of the voice, and when we depend on other people to tell us what God means, it becomes a cult. We have to depend on people to tell us what everything means. And that’s not biblical. So let’s look at the passage and see if the NLT translators did a good job interpreting what this passage means. First of all let’s look at what the Bible says, and then let’s compare it to how these translators paraphrased it. 

But the Bible doesn’t say that, does it? The NLT does, but it isn’t there in the KJV, and it isn’t there in the Greek. And this is a perfect demonstration of why it’s important not to have a thought-for-thought paraphrase of the Bible, because it’s mote like a book of footnotes.

Textual criticism includes a number of [analyses](http://www.kjvtoday.com/home/does-the-second-them-in-psalm-127-refer-to-gods-words). Lexicographical analysis, Thematic analysis, Syntactical analysis, Logical analysis, Theological analysis, Grammatical analysis, and so on. “Context” is the buzz word for people who just want to impose their personal meaning on the text, rather than drawing the meaning out of what the text is clearly saying. Because context is only good for asking, “Who’s talking? Who’s the author talking to? And does it apply to me?”

I love D.A. Carson, I respect him, I think he has a lot of excellent doctrine, but he’s not infallible. He has some doctrinal errors, and when you depend on how he interprets the Bible, instead of what the Bible actually says, you deprive yourself of making that decision yourself. Paraphrases are for baby Christians who are too lazy to read it themselves and decide for themselves what it means. They want to depend on somebody else breastfeeding them milk, and the Bible says the sluggard is too lazy to bring the fork up again to his mouth.

The doctrine of the reprobate (the too late)

The least in the kingdom of God (teaching men to break the least of the commandments)

Fruit / John 15 (fruit of the Christian is more Christians, burning branch = useless) If you don’t win souls, you are useless to God. I mean, Paul says, “I am caught between the two: wanting to be at home with the Lord, and having a burden for the lost.” In other words, “The only reason I’m here is to get people saved, and the only thing I can do on this earth that’s going to matter in a thousand years is preach the gospel, because the only thing on earth that lasts is people. And if I’m not doing something that matters, I’m useless.” That’s what the burning branches mean. I mean, how silly would it be to say, “The vine is Jesus, the branches are Christians, but the fire is literally fire. God is going to throw Christians into the fire.” Who’s he talking to when he says, “You are the branches?” His disciples. Apart from me you can bear no fruit, because Jesus is the word, and faith comes by hearing the words of God.

“You are taught that oyu cannot judge civilizations, as if Britin and Maulon are on the same moral level. That is to give up on hope for humanity to claim that there is no civilization that has produced something better than something else.” ~ [Dennis Prager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQLITo1sDPY)

What does it look like? It means when 50 sodamites get shot up at a gay bar in Orlando Florida, we don’t mourn for them. I’m not saying we should be this militant, angry person full of unwholesome words, but what I am saying is that we should want to help them in life. We shouldn’t advocate their well being. We shouldn’t fight for their rights. And we shouldn’t mourn when the promises of scripture come true, “The wages of sin is death.” We shouldn’t shed one tear for them, we shouldn’t care about them. In 1973 the same thing happened in New Orlens, and churches refused to let the bodies be buried in their cemeteries. We don’t go to their funerals. If you read the context around David’s perfect hatred, he’s not talking about a so-called “loving hatred.” We call them imprecatory psalms, where he’s praying destruction on these enemies of God. But today we don’t like positions that are unpopular. You say, “How can you say that was the wrath and the judgement of God? That was a Muslim!” Well how can you say that Judah was judged by God? That was the Babylonians.

I just read a passage from over 300 pages ago, I think from sometimes in Fall 2016 (it’s 2 Aug 2017 now), and I’m realizing that I’ve fallen away from being open to other interpretations of the Bible. I don’t like other translations because I don’t want to have to study out the linguistics to make my argument. But then I read, “God has spoken through many portions and many ways,” and I really believe that people can be saved from other translations, which means they are the words of Christ. If the Spirit is not speaking through them, then they can’t save anyone. It’s so much of a lighter burden when I don’t have to defend the KJV, because it’s so hard to defend. It’s easier to go to the Greek and make a logical appeal, or do textual criticism and be slow to speak than it is to rashly discredit the Bible in my opponents hand. Why not consider it? Divulge.

“ People who want to teach a works-based salvation that says "Yeah, believe, but you also have to continue obeying and living the life and keep on you serving the Lord", and they want to turn it into a works-based salvation, they grasp at straws to find passages that they can twist in order to teach a works-based salvation. Now, they don't find these verses in a simple book like the book of John. They go to a difficult book because difficult scriptures are easier to twist. Why? Because people don't always have a firm grasp of what they mean, so it's much easier to trick people to see if people move things around. It's a little harder to twist John 3:16, isn't it?”

Living faith vs dead faith: 3 reasons you can’t lose your salvation: Romans 8, nobody drops out between justification and sanctification. John ___, nobody will snatch out of Jesus hands any sheep. And 3, Ephesians 1:13, the Holy Spirit is given to us as the earnest of our inheritance. If we don’t get our inheritance, we get to keep the Holy Spirit, and he’d go with us into hell. That won’t happen.

Five ways to describe the gospel.

23 But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.

24 And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient,

25 In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;

26 And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.

You say, “The reason Pastor Anderson is so popular is because he preaches hard.” No, Timothy 2 is the difference between Anderson and Todd White. But someone needs to strike a balance, and I think John Piper has done that. He preaches hard, and he also preaches gently.

“The first to get emotional loses.” ~ Ben Shapiro

I’m giving you twice the honor I would give someone who behaved like this, pastor.

You’re welcome to amend my work, but its former state of occupation was unacceptable.

What is glorification? Because in Romans 8 it says everyone who is called is justified, and everyone who is justified is glorified. Present tense. But in 1 John 3 he says it has not appeared as yet what we will be. We know that when He appears, we will be like Him, because we will see Him just as He is. So how do we reconcile these? Well, glorification can be thought of as the state of being made perfect, and if you read later on in chapter 3 of 1 John is says no one born of God continues to sin. In other words, when we’re born of God, the new man is perfect. Eternal life starts here. There isn’t a line called death that when we cross it we will suddenly be transformed into a perfect person. Quite the opposite. We’re already perfect. Ethan Miller 2.0 cannot sin because God’s seed abides in me. I am glorified. I’m perfect. But 1 John 1:8, if I claim to be without sin, I deceive myself and the truth is not in me. My old man is being corrupted. But if I sin, it is no longer I myself who do it, but the sin living in me, in this body of death. And when I die, this body of death will be shed from me. Sin will no longer live in me. So it’s not that there will be this transformative process when we see him as he is called glorification that will make us perfect, but we are born perfect, and when we die we will be rid of our old corrupt sinful selves. That’s the way I see glorification.

If you guys remember, last week we talked about Nicodemus, and what made him unique or stand out from the rest of the Pharisees? He listened to Jesus. He was genuinely curious that maybe Jesus was the Son of God, whereas most of the religious leaders resisted that truth. They didn’t want to believe that Jesus was the Son of God. And some of them said, “If many of the Jews believe he’s the promised Messiah, than they are going to do something radical, they’re going to try to over through the Roman empire, and we’re going to be wiped from oblivion.” They didn’t even entertain the idea, “Is this the truth?” They didn’t care. Just like when Jesus asked them, “Was John the Baptist from God?” They said, “If we say he was from God, he’ll ask, ‘Why didn’t you believe him?’ And if we say he wasn’t, the people will stone us.” They never even considered the question, “Was he from God?” They didn’t care if it was true or not. They just thought, these are the pros and cons. This is our logical outlet.

Are people responsible for their mental illnesses? And I would have to answer yes. They may not be responsible in the sense that it’s their fault they have a mental illness, but they are still liable for the behaviors that result from those mental illnesses. A pedophile is mentally ill. There’s no evolutionary basis for calling pedophilia beneficial in any sense. That person’s behavior is driven by characteristics that can be described as immutable if we agree it’s a mental illness, but that in no sense excuses him form the behaviors that proceed from that. Jeffrey Domher was mentally ill, and that didn’t excuse him from killing people, storing them is his refrigerator, and eating them so that he could feel close to them. That is sick, it’s sad that he has that mental illness, but if we are going to pursue the and advocate the betterment of society there can be no exculpation from the behavior of individuals. It also begs the question of whether we are creatures of free-will, or whether our choices are determined by chemical reactions in our brains or whatever else. Whether we want to talk about Behaviorism, Information Processing Theory, Social Cognition, every psychological effort to explain behavior depends on pinning down this cause and effect relationship, and if we can do that, we might as well excuse everyone from their behaviors. “Oh—there’s a reason you bully everyone at school? Well in that case you’re free to go.” No. We don’t do that. And if we do we’re being stupid.

When you read 38 chapters into Job, you ask yourself, “Who’s right?” “Is Job right, or are his friends right? Job says he’s innocent, his friends say God is innocent.”

Can you believe two contrary propositions and be saved? Can you believe in Jesus AND the New Age and be saved? Cover all of your basis? You can’t believe two contrary propositions and be saved. That’s what Saul did. “Proposition 1: God saves.” “Proposition 2: I need to do something to save us.”

God’s grace is not irresistible. People resist it. People who are enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift resist it. That’s what the doctrine of the reprobate is all about.

People aren’t great for what they do for a living; they are great for who they are. Don’t marry somebody because of what they do for a living. Marry somebody for who they are. Everything we build with our hands will go to hell with the world. But what we build with our words, that can last forever. Don’t choose somebody based on what they do for a living. You can do that if you want to. You can choose comfort. I won’t fault you. He can give you nice things, a nice house, whatever you want. Joy is not in comfort and luxury and having everything you want. Joy is in the presence of God, and if you can find someone who will push you towards that your whole life, choose him. It’s going to be better for you. It’s going to be harder for you. It’s going to be worth it. And I’m not just saying in the eternal long run, I’m saying even right here in the world, joy comes from being in the presence of God, not from being very comfortable with a husband who’s just as in love with the things of the world as you are. “Thou wilt shew me the paths of life. In thy presence is fullness of joy. At thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.” You say, “I want joy, I want pleasure.” Money? No, God. You can have one master. Are you going to marry someone whose master is money, or are you going to choose someone whose master is God? I promise, the latter is going to be better for you every time. Do not love the world nor the things in the world, for all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the boastful pride of life is not from the Father but from the world. In other words all the stuff that the world offers. The luxury tub, the double king sized beds, the multi-million dollar ediphus that you want to live in. Don’t love that stuff. That’s not where joy and pleasure is. It’s with God.

If people aren’t being saved, either the gospel isn’t being preached, or the gospel has lost its power.

It’s not my job to persuade them, it’s not my burden to sound smart or make people esteem me as wise; it’s their job to either receive or reject the words of God. I mean, imagine. God is with you, he’s hearing you, and you’re concerned about whether people think you articulated the message well? You should be concerned with one thing: preaching the truth. Preaching the word of God, not filtering it through your persuasive tactics, but simply, “This is what God says. Take it or leave it.” The hearers of the word should be the ones who are concerned. The people who are confronted with God’s word, and it’s their job to accept it, and receive it, and hear God, but they are presented with the opportunity to deny scripture and reject God’s word, and that is what should be concerning. Not whether you win an argument and get boasting points to say, “See? People like me. People respect me.” No, that’s nothing. That’s significant is that these people can reject scripture when you preach it. They should be the nervous ones, not you. Why? Because the Holy Spirit is on your side ministering in their hearts leading them into all truth, and if they deny what the Holy Spirit shows them is true, they call the Holy Spirit a liar, and blaspheme God. That’s a big deal. That’s a huge sin. And the Bible says that the Holy Spirit is speaking through the scriptures. When you show them Bible verses, that’s the Holy Spirit speaking to them. They should be nervous, not you.

One thing I noticed that people can be really hypocritical about is that they’ll go crazy if somebody says, “What the hell?” but they themselves will say, “What on earth?” or “What in the world?” But wait a minute—the earth is God’s footstool. And the world is God’s footstool. Jesus asid don’t swear by the world, but he never said, “Don’t swear by hell.” So you are just teaching for docrines the commandments of men, and you broadbrush us as speaking unwholesome words, but you hypocrite, you’re the one breaking God’s command and we aren’t.

Anderson says, “The Bible uses the word hell, even figuratively, and the Bible says all the words of God are pure words.” But listen, it also says let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth except for edification according to the need of the moment. When James compared tongues to hell, that was for edification. There is a time for unwholesome words, but it’s not without edification, it’s not just when you’re angry at someone and you want to tell them off. No, we’re supposed to put a gate on the door of our mouths at that point, and you can say whatever you want, Anderson, but nobody is above the Bible. And you don’t get to just twist the Bible however you want, into a Prestel and whatever. You don’t get to claim divine elaboration. This is God’s word. And you know a lot, but that doesn’t exempt you from what it clearly says right here, in fact, it makes you more liable for rejecting it.

Francis Chan, shot gun, true believers, but listen, the supposition that certain behaviors will invariably follow belief is not true. It’s called being weak. It’s called not thinking about it. It’s called hyperbolic discounting and loss aversion. If you say, “Well, if you really believed Jesus is the best financial advisor, you would take his advice,” you’d be making a psychological appeal, and pychology isn’t a deterministic science. But what we do know from what psychological research has been done is that just because people believe certain behaviors are going to be better in the long run, doesn’t mean they will adopt those behaviors. Psychology is a lot more complicated than that, and you can’t plug it into a formula and say, “Based on X behavior I can deduce Y about your belief.” People who say that are making a psychological error, and a psychological appeal, not a theological appeal. So be careful when you hear them say that. “You can tell that you’re not a believer if you don’t sell everything you have.” That’s simply not true.

The no true Scotsman is not always a fallacy. I can say, “No true bachelor is married,” and I’d be absolutely correct. No true scotsman is a fallacy in that specific situation because it’s demonstrably false that that being a scotsman will inevitably result in scot-like behavior. Doesn’t mean the logic itself is flawed, it means the pretexts applied to that logic was flawed. If the Bible says, “No true believer will do XYZ,” I would believe it. And it says no true believer will blaspheme the Holy Spirit (slander Jesus when the Holy Spirit convicts you that the slander you are taking part in is not true), take the mark of the beast, or refuse to hear the apostolic words.

I argue that we have to use logic to understand the Bible, or we will believe some ridiculous things. When the Bible says, “Don’t lean on your own understanding,” that means, “Don’t make it your final authority.” Don’t make it your foundation. The Bible is in no part saying, “Understanding = bad. Logic = bad.” No. Proverbs is filled with verses to the contrary. What he’s saying is, if God says something, in in our minds we can’t understand it (maybe we don’t understand his justice, or we don’t understand the trinity, or whatever it may be), we believe God anyway. But the Bible never commissions us, “Hey, don’t use understanding.” Jesus even gets frustrated when his disciples don’t understand things. He says, “Are you so dull?” “Have you been with me so long yet you still don’t know me?” I argue that we need understanding and logic to interpret the Bible. And by the way, the Bible never says that the rules of logic don’t apply to the supernatural. The rules of logic are axiomatic and self-necessary, not contingent on the universe. If any other universe exists, it will by necessity have the same rules of logic. The Bible is not exempt from logic, and we should use logic to understand the Bible. Also, the Bible never says anything about logic. Understanding isn’t the same thing as the 9 rules of logic.

I think I’m smarter than Steven Anderson. He’s too busy and intense to dissect the Bible in a logical way. But we is extremely fluent in Bible knowledge, which makes his sermons a useful asset in collected arguments, refining them through logic, and seeing if they are true. Put them through a syllogism, and apply propositions to his arguments to see if they are true. I’m not going to abandon William Lane Craig for Steven Anderson. I’m going to filter Anderson’s arguments through William Lane Craig’s principles of logic, and see if they are true.

Andrew takes the positions that when the Bible says it’s impossible for reprobates to repent, it means they just won’t repent. In their own hearts, none of them are going to. But I hear that and say, “What’s to stop them from coming back?” People change their minds all the time. The Bible has to warn us against changing our minds because it is possible to do that. If it’s possible for people to change their minds, then it’s possible for them to change their mind about the gospel. And the Bible says it’s impossible. If it was, “Well they just won’t,” then the Bible would say something like in 1 John 3:6, “No one who becomes reprobate repents.” It doesn’t say that, it says it’s impossible. And it’s only impossible if God blinds their eyes. And we see that in Isaiah 6, he says, “Who will blind their eyes, lest they return?” God knows that it’s possible for them to return. He doesn’t want them to. He hates them. He’s rejected them. But he’s faithful to his promises, the Bible says it’s impossible for God to deny himself, and he knows if they return to me, it’s impossible for me to deny my promise that I will save them, because he promised that, so he says, “How can I make it impossible for them to repent?” And that only makes sense if God has rejected them. If God hates them. Because the Bible says, “Whosoever believes,” and if one of these reprobates believes, they’ll be saved. But the Bible says it’s impossible for them to be saved, and that means God has made it impossible for them to believe, and we see that in the Bible. God blinds eyes, and shuts ears, and it says they could not believe. It’s harmonious. Versus if you take Andrew’s perspective that they just won’t come back on their own initiative, first you run into the problem that when the Bible says it’s impossible, it’s lying, and secondly you have no way of explaining why God blinds eyes and makes deaf ears. It says that God hates everyone who’s eyes are blind. Because everyone God hates, he blinds their eyes so that there’s no way for them to believe and be saved. I don’t know how Andrew can explain that.

Don’t even use that argument that Jesus said, “I’m making all things new” as an excuse to just reject the Bible. You’re quite right when you say God doesn’t change. You just refuted your own argument. Thank you. Now I don’t have to.

I think people can be saved through new versions of the Bible. Why? Because faith comes by hearing, and by hearing of the word of God. And in John 11 we see that God can use unsaved Ciaphas to speak. God can speak through whatever he wants, and when the NIV says, “For God so loved the world, that whoever believes in him shall not die but have eternal life,” that’s the words of Christ. Maybe there are some other verses that have problems, but you know what? Ciaphas probably said some untrue things as well. And yet God used him to prophesy in one instance. And so I think God can use the NIV to save people, even though it isn’t the perfect word of God. God can speak though it. And secondly, people do believe on Jesus by hearing these words. And so if people beget faith by reading the NIV, then the God must speak through the NIV. Doesn’t mean the NIV is the complete, perfect word of God, it just means God can speak through a corrupt book.

The Bible never says, “God can only speak through the Biblical Cannon.” He can speak through books, he can speak through people. And do you think God is done speaking through people just because we have a complete cannon? The Bible actually predicts 2 prophets who speak from God, and those words are not in the Cannon. So I don’t think it’s justified to discredit somebody’s faith because they didn’t hear a verbatim verse from the King James Bible. Plus, I think the words of God mean the news about what God has done in redemptive history. If you tell someone about the news, and the Holy Spirit draws them in and convicts them to believe it, they can be saved.

All these new songs are like strange fire before the Lord. Regardless of good intentions, be careful what you offer to him. God likes things done a certain way, not just whatever creative way you can think up. That’s what we can learn from Aaron’s sons. I mean, they were doing their creative art for God, and he killed them. Don’t mess around when it comes to affiliating God’s name with your deviant crafts. Your deviant art. This is like when the Pharisees in Matthew 23 are accused of devouring widows' houses and for a pretense making long prayer. He says, “Don’t you dare put God’s name on that.” We ought to be more discerning about the music we make, listen to, dance to, and especially offer to God as worship. Don’t think for one second that there’s no such thing as “strange music” before God. You bet there is. You say, “Strange is subjective.” Well I suppose Aaron’s sons used that argument with their strange fire, but God killed them for it. I mean, do you think for one second God is okay with nude art being associated with the things of God? I saw that as DBU one time. Marry was washing Jesus feat, and her breasts were not covered. That’s not okay. In all forms of art there are things that are not okay. Music is no exception from that. Music has so much power. Power over mood, attitude, feelings, sexual drive. Don’t be fooled: not all music is pleasing to God just because you put his name on it. No, no, no. You put his name on music like that and it makes it way worse. I’m not saying all CCM is evil. I’m saying we need to be vigilant and discerning in knowing what’s not okay and what is. And CCM is new. You say, “The Bible says sing a new song.”

If faith was believing in the sum total of God’s promises, such that when sin tempted you, you could say, “No, God promises it’s better if I say ‘No,’” and you don’t sin, the cross would be purposeless. There’d be no reason for it. You would just believe God. No, that kind of belief is works. Faith is believing that Jesus is the Christ so that you can be saved from the other kind of unbelief. The moment unbelief that says, “I want sin no matter what God says.”

Don’t wait around for him to ask you. That’s a good way to stay single for the rest of your life. Ruth was beautiful. The Bible says she was beautiful, and Boaz didn’t ask her squat. It didn’t matter how beautiful she was because that’s not what stopped him from trying to be with her. It was his own insecurities. Remember the first thing he said after Ruth folded the sheet over his feet? “You are righteous, because you could’ve picked a younger man.” So evidently in Boaz’s mind, “She’s young, she’s beautiful; she can have a better man than me.” And then she chooses him, and he says, “You are righteous.” And so what we can learn from this story, is don’t worry about age differences, just find the guy who’s loaded. Find someone with money. But the point is Ruth asked him. I mean what’s the first couple you can think of in the Bible? What’s the star couple, the first ones you think of? Isn’t it Boaz and Ruth? And the same thing that stopped Boaz from being with Ruth is the same thing that’s stopping a lot of guys from being with you, “She can have someone better.” You’ve got to be proactive. Fold the sheet over his feet. In other words, “Hint, hint, nudge, nudge.” You’ve got to show them, “Hey stupid, I like you.” Now obviously I’m not saying throw your shirt off at every guy that walks around the corner, but just show a little interest.

Men are very analytical. Many guys I talk to think in the same terms, “Well she can have someone better, so I shouldn’t try and make her settle for less.” If it’s between a table of meat and a meal of vegetables, the best option is to choose the table of meat, and that’s just an objective way of looking at it. Men don’t personalize everything. “Well I want, and she wants,” some of us just think in binary terms, “Meat > Vegetables.” “That other single guy > me.” “I’m not alpha.” And Boaz was alpha! He was the head guy around there, and he still felt inadequate to presume on Ruth’s affection. “Take a chance. So what if you’re rejected?” It’s not about being rejected. It’s about an objective way of looking at situations and saying, “My advice is to choose the better of two alternatives.” Right? No favoritism. It doesn’t matter that I’m the lesser of two alternatives. That doesn’t give it any weight.

Let me submit to you that the reason you are not with anybody is not because you’re not pretty enough, it isn’t because nobody enjoys your company, the reason you are alone is because you haven’t folded the sheet over anybody’s feet.

“I’m sorry to interrupt, but we have very little time.” Less time then you think, ma’am. This life is like a breath, it’s gone before you know it, and that’s why I’m here, because we’re all right beside eternity, and once you cross that line of death, there’s no going back.

There’s a difference between a delusion and an erroneous belief, so even if I’m wrong and you’re right, it’s simply an ad homanim in an attempt to belittle another person’s dignity to call their belief a delusion merely because it deviates from what you agree with.

Let me ask you something: I Christianity were true, would you believe it?

Yeah, there’s good and bad to every situation. If I went into a dark alley and stabbed Bruce Wayne’s parents to steal any money that was on them, that’d be good for me. It’d be bad for them and good for me, and so where’ good and bad to the situation, but that makes it no less simple that it is plainly wrong to do that.

I think rap may be used insofar as a unit of language to admonish and speak to each other, but I don’t think it’s legitimate to offer rap as worship to God. We should be cautious of what we offer to God as worship. I read about Aarons two sons one time and what I took out of that story is that we can do things in worship to God that he doesn’t accept, and I think we should be mindful of that. I mean, we just assume sometimes, I think, that God like everything. If he had a palate, every kind of food would taste good to him, if he had a nose, every kind of scent would smell good to him (insofar as it smells good to one of us), if he had ears every song would sound good to him, but it isn’t true. There’s strange incense, and strange fire before the Lord. Just because we like it, doesn’t mean God likes it. And just because we don’t like it doesn’t mean God doesn’t like it. Some people don’t like frankincense, but God calls it a sweet aroma. There’s really not a lot we can do to pin down what music God approves and what music God rejects. There’s a difference between what we listen to and what we offer to God as worship. If Aarons sons wanted to make strange fire for the fun of it, that’s one thing, but when you impose it on God, and say “surprise!” that’s another thing. This isn’t a little child surprising mommy and daddy with breakfast in bed and it’s awful so they chastise the child. That’s not what this is. But we do need to understand that this is in the Bible. God doesn’t accept all forms of worship. Especially when it’s written by the spirit of antichrist.

I don’t think apologetics can save anyone, because faith comes by hearing and hearing the words of Christ, but I do think some people have sincere questions that they stumble over, and they cause them to resist the Holy Spirit pulling on their heart strings, and apologetics can be useful in removing those obstacles so that they can stop resisting the Holy Spirit.

“In Christian Doctrine…” That’s may be a Christian’s doctrine, but it certainly isn’t biblical.

Now it would be disingenuous of us not to warn you, that you’ve just declared war on the strongholds of Satan, and you are a child of God, and the Bible says

You’re going to be put in situations to make you very uncomfortable, but it’s okay, because according to the Bible, when you get saved, you receive the Holy Spirit, and Jesus said that he’s sent him as a comforter. He was like, “They’re going to be so uncomfortable; they’re going to need this.” And so you can except that as you grow in Christ. Right now you’re a babe in Christ, and just like a little baby there’s a time of grace for learning and growing up, but there will come a time when God begins to chastise you, because he loves you. And what you need to know, is that it’s for your good. It’s to make you perfect, because the Bible says we are perfected through suffering. And so as you grow in maturity, you’ll see more attacks from Satan, you’ll see chastisement from God, (and the Bible says that if we continue in sin, there remained no more sacrifice for sins, but a fearful expectation of fiery indignation. It’s this picture of a little child who, you know, maybe you’re home alone and you brake something, and you know there’s nothing you can do to fix it, you’re just dreading when mom comes home and you have nothing but a fearful expectation of fiery indignation. But we grow through those experiences, and that’s how we get sin out of our lives, is through God’s corrective discipline.), and it will all be worth it. Because look, as an unbeliever, Satan has no reason to harm you. He wants to use you. And as an unbeliever, God’s not going to discipline you as he would a child. The Bible says that wrath is storing up for unbelievers for the day of judgement. And now that wrath, all the sins you ever did has been poured out on Jesus. When you sin, like I said, you’re a babe in Christ, you won’t notice it right away, but as you grow up, God is going to begin punishing you in this life for your sins. Because there’s no more punishment after that. Your sins are paid for. You don’t go to hell, but because God is merciful, he perfects us through suffering. It’s not even really punishment; it’s correction. It’s so that we don’t waste our lives on this earth, hallelujah.

The Bible talks about how he has predestined the children of faith for adoption. The moment you believe, God adopts you, and you’re now a child of God.

We should talk about verses and present our arguments as though we just learned them. What I mean by this is that when I read the Bible for the first time, I was extremely enthusiastic about all of the novelties I was uncovering, and when I quoted a verse, I quoted it with conviction and power, whereas when I become older and more familiar with the Bible, I didn’t feel like I was presenting an argument anybody hadn’t heard already, I didn’t think I was surprising them, and I didn’t want them to think I was new to the argument, so I would sort of pass over the verses in a really casual way, and it always waters down your argument when you argue that way (as though there’s no epiphany attached to it).

God spake through unsaved Caiaphas, the Bible talks about prophets in revelation who will speak the word of God, and the Bible even says when we are brought before the rulers and synagogues God will teach us what to say in that very hour. The words of God are not limited to the closed Cannon. That’s part of what the cannon says. “My sheep will hear and obey my voice, but a stranger’s voice they will not follow.” No matter what other wrong things people say in their lives the Holy Spirit cans peak through you. It doesn’t vindicate everything a person says when the Holy Spirit speaks through you, but the wrong things you say don’t restrict the Holy Ghost from using you for his purposes. The NIV, I believe, can save people. People can believe on Jesus Christ by reading the NIV. My dad did. And so if you want to sit there and say, “People can’t be saved from reading the NIV,” that’s where we’re going to have to disagree.

What’s with the water works? When do we cry? When somebody has been hurt. And when do we let our feelings be hurt? Do our feelings get hurt when somebody is rude to us? When someone insults us? We bless them. Return good for evil.

I believe that unsaved people can get people saved. You say, “John 15 says that apart from Jesus, we can bear no fruit.” I beliee that 100%. But listen, an unsaved person can have the words of Jesus in them. People don’t get blacklisted from reading the Bible. And Jesus said, “If you abide in me, and my words abide in you.” People can preach the words of Christ, not having Christ, and yet by the Holy Spirit working through that unsaved person save those who would hear it. I’m thinking of Philippians 1:15-18. Listen, without the words of Christ, nobody gets saved, and in that sense, apart from Christ nobody gets saved. But the Bible doesn’t say you need to be saved for the Holy Spirit to speak through you. We see the opposite is true in scripture (Caiaphas). I believe people can get saved by just reading the Bible raw. And so apart from Jesus we can bear no fruit, but that applies to believers as well as unbelievers. I mean, if a saved person in Christ tries to get people saved without the Bible, it’s not going to work. I think that’s what Jesus is saying here.

It says, “Believe and be baptized.” Now look, if I say, “Put a ring on that finger,” is the ring what makes you married? No. And baptism isn’t what makes you saved. It’s just a symbol. Buried in the likeness of his death, and raised to walk in the newness of life.

What you can do now that you’re saved, is you can be baptized. And that’s like putting a ring on your finger. God instructs us to be baptized. And so we would love to see you at Northlake Baptist Church, and we will baptize you.

You can’t just do things for God without knowing the will of God. If you spend all your time doing things for God, and no time searching out what it is he actually wants you to do, you’re going to end up like Saul before he encountered Jesus, and he spent his whole life doing things for God. He persecuted Christians for God. And he was forgiven because he did it out of ignorance, but let that sink in. Paul had to be forgiven for the things he did for God. You draw a picture, you put a lot of effort into it, but effort – knowledge = sin. Whatever doesn’t proceed from faith is sin, and you can’t have faith in what you don’t understand. Seems backwards, right? “If you have faith, you don’t know. If you knew it wouldn’t be faith.” But the Holy Spirit works in our hearts to draw us to Christ, and before we can trust Jesus, the Holy Spirit has to enlighten us about what we’re believing in.

Quit working hard to quit. You cannot be tempted if you don’t think it. Unless you’re thinking about a thing, you cannot be tempted by that thing. Sometimes you consider the problem all the time, trying to come up with a solution to the problem—whatever you’re tempted with, if you consider it all the time, then that’s what you’re going to be available to do all the time. But if you stop thinking about it… and somebody says, “Well how do I stop thinking about it?” Well start talking. Open your mouth up. Reap something. Get up. ([Creflo Dollar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlkEyZb7d2A)) That’s why the Bible says, “If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? And if thou doest not well, sin laith at the door.” It says, “Every branch that bears much fruit will be pruned.” And it’s only when you start filling up your mind with other things, when you start getting to work for God, that there’s no room left to think about the temptation anymore. You have to fill your mind with godly things.  You’ve got to start soul-winning. Reading your Bible. If you don’t do that… idle hands are the devil’s workshop. He will get to you. He will find work for you if you aren’t working for God. You can be a slave to obedience or a slave to sin, but the devil owns the fence. If you say, “I’m just going to not sin, but I don’t need to live godly,” you’ll end up sinning.

Sometimes we make the gospel a little too complicated in our efforts to make sure people understand how to be saved. Usually it’s not with people that are actually preaching the gospel, but people who are preparing to preach it. People like me, for a long time, who wanted to be prepared to answer every question I’ve ever thought about, every question I’ve heard, and every question I could imagine. And there’s a lot of Bible, and sometimes you get to the end of yourself and go, “Man, you really have to know a lot to prevent being misled into believing all these false doctrines.” And you want to basically give your converts a seminary degree to prepare them for what they might encounter when you leave the door, but I’m here to say that’s just not practical. And don’t you worry, nobody will snatch one of Jesus Christ’s sheep out of his hands. Just give them the simple, believe on Jesus gospel, and whatever else there is to know, pray for your convert because it’s the Holy Spirit who’s going to teach them, not you. Invite them to church, explain baptism, but don’t try and make yourself responsible for the promises of God. God promised them, and God will keep his promises.

Oh, you’re cute, and I totally would, except that I’m a Christian, and Jesus said to honor the marriage bed, so that’s what I’m going to do. “Oh okay—cool. I don’t know if I could do that.” No you could, you might just get married a little faster that way.

I saw a naked woman one time as a young boy. I was researching various people groups on Wikipedia, and there was an image of this woman with her breasts drawn out, and they were old and sagging like down to her belly, and I saw that, and I said, “Beauty is fleeting.” The Bible is not playing around when it says that.

I don’t know anyone who interprets the Bible more seriously than Francis Chan. I don’t know anybody who lives it out more seriously than Steven Anderson. Francis Chan’s instinct when he reads something in the Bible is, “This is how I should live.” Steven Anderson is desensitized to new ideas. He’s read the Bible through his own eye so many times it’s inconceivable to him that he could be wrong about some things. But what about the most basic thing? Salvation? What about when God says, “I’ve not put a Spirit of fear in you?” And yet Francis says it shouldn’t sit right with us when we fear because of that verse. But what is “not sitting righ” if it isn’t fear? If it isn’t this insecurity because we aren’t sure about our salvation? If we’ll be in heaven? Francis is more exciting because you’re always on edge, you have to live right, and everybody wants their lives to change. Nobody is content who’s living in sin. Anderson and Chan are both preaching to people living in sin, the question is, “Who is more appealing?” A man preaching to assure the saints of their salvation, saying, “You already have all there is,” or someone with a message of hope that I could actually be delivered of this sin? Francis is more appealing, but after that doesn’t work, Anderson is more appealing, because we’ll do anything to get rid of the despair of going to hell. “If I look at my life and it doesn’t look like the Bible, then I’m not saved.” That’s Francis Chan’s message. “If I look at my life and it doesn’t match up with the Bible, then you will be punished by a heavenly Father who loves you.”

The fundamental difference between eternal security and perseverance of the saints is this issue of free-will. Who or what determines the decisions I make? The Calvinistic perspective of agency is central to the point of disagreement between these two positions. Calvinists say that something fundamentally changes in the human condition when you get saved (your heart of stone is removed and you’re given a heart of flesh), while proponents of eternal security argue that the way you make decisions after you are saved is the same way you made decisions before you were saved. We disagree about what causes behavior, because Calvinists don’t believe we are in control of the decisions we make. Now I do believe that God can harden hearts, and blind eyes, and keep people from believing on his Son Jesus for the remission of sins, but I do not agree in any part that by that same token God is the ultimate puppet master of our sins. It’s non sequitur, and beyond that, the Bible says God cannot tempt anyone. It says the things of the world are not from the Father. Then where are they from? The world, it says. Nobody believes that God gives us total free-will. I can’t fly. God did not give me the option to choose that. But the difference is not in that kind of free-will, but the freedom to determine how we think, what we believe, and how we behave. Interestingly enough, one central question we can explore is the relationship between factors such as environment, social models, chemicals in the brain, biological urges that are hardwired not in our conscious mind, but in our subconscious body, and the mind. How do these outside factors play a role in our free-will decision making? How does music affect our attitude? These questions will show us that we can either be determined or affected. The question is, “Can affection determine?” And it can in at least one way: when God affects our hearts by hardening it when we reject his Son after being enlightened. Calvinists believe in another affection-to-determination dynamic, namely God’s irresistible grace, meaning, our affection for God becomes so strong that we can’t choose to reject him. Calvinists argue that when that happens, when we receive God’s Son, God does the opposite of hardening our hearts, he softens it so that (just as you can’t believe on him if you’re reprobate) you can’t reject him if you’re saved. Okay, but it doesn’t stop there. And if that’s all it way, I wouldn’t even argue that point. What they are saying is that the renewed self makes behavioral decisions in a different way than before because of God’s intervention in our free-will. I just don’t see that in the Bible. I’ve looked for it, I used to have a mountain of verses to support it, but little by little they all dwindled away as I understood them in their proper meaning. This is really a question of who God is when you think about it. Does he intervene in our sin choices or not? Piper argues that when God opens your eyes to see his glory, you cannot help but choose him over sin. You have no choice. The human condition, as he puts it, always chooses what’s best. Now if that were true, we would all eat healthier. I think that’s a psychological fallacy. We can’t think about psychology in a programmed way. “People always choose XYZ.” That’s not true. So this question of soteriology is actually a question of God’s role in our decision making. If we are truly free creatures, then a saved person who “truly” believes on Jesus can still fall into sin. The only alternative is to say it’s impossible, and it’s only impossible if God intervenes in our free-will decisions. That’s where the disagreement is coming from. That’s what it’s ultimately rooted in. “Will bear much fruit.” They think that God’s presence in our hearts after we believe necessarily produces fruit as naturally as a tree. If we can figure out the question of our behavior, we figure out this question of faith always being accompanied by works. Piper says there’s two kinds of “can’ts,” there’s a, “if my comfort is more important to me than the person walking by who asks for my help, I can’t get up.” I disagree with that 100%, even though it makes sense. And it does make sense. But it’s too loose. It puts too much stress on the word “can’t” to bend it outside of what it means.

To be intellectual is to say to God, “It isn’t your job to enlighten this person, it’s mine.” I am so much more at home speaking intelligently, considering new ideas, diagramming arguments calmly in a rational way, and being reasonable with people. The problem with that mindset is that it elevates me to God’s place. It often bothered me why people who have their doctrine right, like Steven Anderson, and many others who write with exclamation marks and all caps, are so inarticulate and irrational. They just seem so dumb. And I thought, “The world needs somebody like me to come along and give Anderson’s position on doctrine in a rational way, so as to counter the arguments of people like Jeff Durbin, James White, John Piper, Tim Keller, etc.” I wanted to be a rational voice for Easy Believism, and dissect Bible verses in a completive way. Then I realized to do that is to totally useless, because it’s the Holy Spirit that enlightens people in their hearts, and he does that with his word, not mine. Maybe this is why God uses the base things of the world to confound the wise. Paul was crazy intelligent, in my opinion. That verse always confused me. But nevertheless, I realized I’m depended on the wrong thing to enlighten people when I’m trying to get at their beliefs through logic and reason and being persuasive. Plato can’t enlighten anyone in the mysteries of God. It’s a spiritual book, and it can’t be carnally understood. And people like Anderson, all he does is spew out Bible verses, and he makes sense. It’s not eloquent, but it’s pure.

When it comes to Total Depravity, it’s really important to discuss what you mean by it, because usually when I talk to a Calvanist we agree about what he means by Total Depravity, but we disagree about what it means. Nobody is disagreeing that we’re all sinners deserving of hell. If all you mean is Romans 3:23, that’s one thing. But if you are saying none of us can accept the free gift of salvation without God making us alive in order to receive it, we have something to talk about. We were dead in our trespasses. What does that mean? I think it means that we’re all as good as dead. We have a bullet with our name on it. It’s a cowboy saying, “You’re a dead man.” Why? Because the wages of sin is death, and all of us sin. According to the Calvinist, it means that because we’re dead, we can’t make decisions. We’re so bad, that when God offers salvation to us, we can’t accept it unless God softens us first. So it’s really not up to us, it’s up to God. God just arbitrarily decides who he loves and who he hates based on zero conditions. There’s nothing we can do to satisfy a condition of salvation, God just waves his arm over us and says, “Damned. Damned. Accepted.” It’s a game of duck, duck, goose.” I don’t believe that. God predestined the arrangement of being saved by grace through faith, meaning if anyone freely places their faith on Jesus, they qualify, they have satisfied the condition of salvation, and they are given the right to become a children of God, because they have the faith of Abraham. God predestined the people group of the children of Abraham (meaning those who have faith in God like he did) to be saved; he did not predestine which individual people would be have faith. Instead of choosing people based on immutable characteristics like ethnicity or nationality, which we have no control over, he predestined a plan whereby we all get to choose whether we are a child of Abraham. That makes sense. But saying that predestination is just some random process of God selecting some and rejecting others based on nothing that differentiates them, (because they’re not different until God makes them different)—I think that is a mischaracterization of the true God. Total Depravity is fundamentally twisted if you mean that in order for someone to have faith, God needs to first make you able to have faith. Here’s what it means: that in Ephesians 2:8-9, “this is not of yourselves,” means “faith is not of yourselves.” It’s written in the neuter form, so we know it means the arrangement of being saved by grace through faith is not of ourselves, but the gift of God. The gift of God is not faith. The gift of God is eternal life given to anyone who qualifies, who satisfies the condition of salvation, which is faith. This is where we get an in argument of words, because I can’t make a calvanist agree with me on that. I can show him grammatical rules in the Greek, and he still won’t believe me. Because he’s indoctrinate, not learned in the thigns of God. He didn’t let the Holy Spirit be his teacher, he let James White be his teacher.

The man that beat his chest wasn’t assenting to total depravity. He was recognizing that he was a wretched sinner. “Wretched man that I am. Who will set me free from this body of death?” Not, “Wretched man that I am. Who will make me able to have faith?” The very fact that he beat his chest shows that Total Depravity doesn’t exist. Because he never would have been able to recognize, “I’m a sinner, and I’m depraved, and I need forgiveness,” if he was totally depraved. If he was dead in the sense that you mean it. That story is a demonstration that even while we are dead in our sins, we can recognize by our own free-will that we need forgiveness. The emphasis for the Calvinist is total inability to come to Christ. We can’t, we don’t want to, we’re enemies of God, we’re hostile to God, we’re not looking for God (Romans 3:10), nobody wants him in our natural state. Our condition before God is that we will not come to God, we hate God, we’re sinners, helpless, and that’s the condition God meets us in when he saves us. (I can tell you right now that wasn’t my state before October 18, 1999 when I got saved as a 3 year old boy. I did not hate God.) Are we saved by grace? Is it really unmerited favor? Or is it something in us that drew God to us? The Calvinists say that ultimately, if we embrace this idea that we are unable to come to God and that we’re actually dead in our sins, than all the people in heaven, to some degree, will have themselves to thank for the decision they made. That’s one and the same as someone saying, “If you call on the Lord for salvation, that’s work!” No, you don’t earn salvation by asking for it. You qualify by placing your faith on Jesus. That’s what the Bible says. Yes there is something that we do. It doesn’t in any small part mean that we merited salvation. But Calvinists will confuse qualification with merit. They’ll say, “Hey, if we’re responsible for our faith, then we worked for it, and salvation isn’t a gift, it’s a wage.” That is the single most stupid thing Calvinists believe. At least their other points make sense. This one doesn’t even make sense. You don’t earn something by asking for it, and you don’t thank yourself when someone gives you a gift by saying, “I’m so glad I asked you for it.” Mannerism, or synergism? Is it one at work, or two at work?

Romans 4: If Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about (present tense--in heaven right now.) Are the people in heaven boasting about “Oh I was more intelligent then another guy, I’m so glad I figured it out,” or are they boasting about a God who loved them despite them? - That’s a false dichotomy. And it’s a stupid question, and Paul says to avoid foolish questions. But I’ll wrestle with it anyway, because I feel you are sincere about raising it. I don’t think anyone who if they heard a fireman calling, “Come to me,” and you came to him, would say, “I’m so glad I believed.” No. They’re glad the fireman saved them. Get real. And so what? People can find something to boast about in your doctrine to. But if you have nothing that differentiates you from the people burning in hell, you just lost justice. I would rather live in a heaven where people say, “I fought the good fight of faith,” then a heaven where people say, “God showed partiality to me, because I’m in heaven and my brother is in hell even though we were in the exact same condition. I’m just God’s favorite, and there’s no reason why.” That heaven doesn’t exist anywhere but in your imagination, because the Bible says God shows no partiality. Total Depravity only makes sense in conjunction with Unconditional Election, but there’s a condition to God’s election, and it’s faith. If there is no condition, than why isn’t everyone saved?

Durbin is a very wise man, but it’s funny how easy his arguments are to refute. How can somebody so smart be so blind?

The reason that I started studying and memorizing in KJV is so that I could have conversations with KJV Onliests. A lot of times when I would quote a verse, it would be different in the KJV, and I wasn’t prepared to show them what it meant in that translation, so they could just reject the Bible, and I didn’t like that. Then I realized, “Hey wait a minute—they’re different. That’s a problem.”

God mocks sinners (Proverbs 3:34), but fools mock sin (Proverbs 14:9). So much for, “Love the sinner, hate the sin.” It’s “Mock the sinner, take seriously the sin.”

The only difference between what you call grape juice and what you call wine is the amount of alcohol that has already been fermented. Why is grape juice not an appropriate substitute for wine? Because it’s not alcoholic enough for you. But listen, look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his color in the cup, when it moveth itself aright.

If it was just this deal about big sins and little sins, no sin would deserve hell. I mean you might think, “If I lie I deserve hell?” But by that same token, it wouldn’t be just to burn in hell for all of eternity just for murdering someone either. Murder is a finite crime. Rape is a finite crime. And if that’s all it was, I would say, “Hey, you deserve death, and once you die, your sin is paid for.” I wouldn’t assign to a murderer, just because they killed someone, to face a lake of fire, with anguish and writhing and gnashing of teeth, and the screams and the darkness, and the smoke, and that’s all they have to look forward to for all of eternity. That would not be just. A finite sin cannot merit an infinite punishment and be just. That’s an unjust balance. The reason we deserve hell for our sins is not because we commit finite sins against each other, but because we commit sins against an infinite God.

I don't do debates. Here is everything the New Testament says about debate:

"Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers," - Romans 1:29

"For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:" - 2 Corinthians 12:20﻿

In order for the atheist to adopt the notion that there is a multi-verse, he is forced to admit with equal plausibility the idea that God created our universe. Otherwise his argument is self-referentially incoherent, because he's using a standard to say, "You can't say God exists because it's a metaphysical appeal, and science can only test that which is within nature," and then he violates that standard by appealing to a metaphysical theory about a multi-verse that's outside of our universe, operating under different physics and rules of nature. It can't be shown to be true any more than God can, except it makes life here even more improbable due to the appearance of design in the multi-verse that we happened to end up in.

 [[EM1]](#_msoanchor_1)I wonder if we really pray to God as if we were praying to God. Or if we’re just casual about it, “sending” little messages up throughout the day. Maybe even rolling your eyes up for God to agree with you that someone just said or did something stupid. I see people do that. “Sorry, I just had a Jesus moment.” We’re too thoughtless with God. We don’t regard him for who he is, and when you get just a flash of a shape to remind you that he is listening, you remember who he is. You don’t complain after that. All that can fall out of your mouth is two things: praise to him and contempt for yourself. Your head is looking down, “God You’re so holy; I’m unworthy. Don’t look at me. Please, please, I can’t stand in Your presence.” Rob bell in the first episode of his Wisdom series talks about a scenario with a blue whale.

 [[EM2]](#_msoanchor_2)The Primary purpose of this sentence was gratitude. Mom was happy to be surprised that Ethan, Deborah and Dad were working and she didn’t have to wake anybody up.

 [[EM3]](#_msoanchor_3)This was the first symptom of communication disorder. Since mom had just said she woke up surprised that she did not have to wake anybody up and to find us working, it was non-sequitur to note that Brian is not up, because Brian was not going to Murphy Maze Days and therefore is not included among the significant “everyone.” It would have been more appropriate to say, “We wanted to surprise you for your birthday!”

 [[EM4]](#_msoanchor_4)The root of this sentence sprang from a distaste of Caleb’s sarcasm. “Obviously mom wasn’t talking about Brian, because she hadn’t planned on waking him up. Mom came out while we were gardening, and about a half hour later I came inside to see you coming downstairs for breakfast, which is the first appearance you make every day. Therefore when mom quote, ‘looked out the window’ to see that everyone was already awake, you also were not included in the significant “everyone.” Nevertheless, understanding the sarcasm in your first statement, I used a joking manner of voice and laughed when pointing out that you were also not awake at the time she was referring to.

 [[EM5]](#_msoanchor_5)This is the infringement point. Up to this point, nobody has been infringed or violated by any resentment for another person. This is where Caleb felt that he needed to rectify himself because he didn’t want us to think that he wasn’t awake when mom got up. Nobody cares what time Caleb got up, it would have been appropriate to simply laugh along with Ethan. Instead, defensive listening caused Caleb to argue his case which is of no relevance to anyone. “I was awake when mom got up.” Big deal. Learn what’s worth your efforts at contention. This isn’t. There would be absolutely no problem or importance or derailment to have left it at Ethan’s comment, but since personal defensive listening
