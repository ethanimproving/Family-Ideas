The rest of my life depends on whether or not I continue studying when I don't feel like it. I don't feel like it now. These algorithms are boring to me. I want to watch TV in the background. I want to go for a run. I want to study my ancestors. Why are these algorithms important?

> [!bible] [Ecclesiastes 12:12 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Ecclesiastes+12:12?translation=kjv)
> 12. And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end; and ==much study is a weariness of the flesh==.

Though I be weary, I will continue. This work is my livelihood. This work is the most important thing I will ever do, because this is a programmer's entrance into e work force. This work is the display of my mental fortitude. If I cannot force myself to put mental effort into these problems, I cannot prove my abilities in technical interviews. It is not unfitting to challenge the capabilities of those who speak well. I am a good programmer. Among the top tier of those I have worked with. But I was fired and now it's my lot in life to find new work. I owe it to my future family to do the best that I can to learn these problem solving techniques. I owe it to Mariana, to her parents who I will take care of, to my children who I will take care of, to my own brothers who I may be called upon to aid, to Adam if he needs my support, to John if his children abandon him, to my own parents if their retirement fails. I am responsible for the care of so many people I love. That will be the driving motivation for me to learn these algorithms.

I wish I was disciplined. But my version of discipline is talking myself into doing the things that I don't want to do, convincing myself that it's worth it. And this study is worth it. If my back hurts in the hallway, I'll move to me bed with my laptop. If my neck hurts in bed, I drive to my office at Caleb's.

Lord give us increase. Lift up my brothers. Give Brian a higher salary than I've ever achieved. Give stable Caleb an elevated position, and substance enough to build a family. Give me the [[Gain Discipline|discipline]] I need to deny myself and prepare for my upcoming interviews. Be with me in my preparation. Give me understanding. Give me favor with the interviewers. Be with me, I pray. Amen.
