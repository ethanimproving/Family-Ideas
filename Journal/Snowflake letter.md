I'm sorry mom. I didn't mean to make you cry. **It isn't easy for me to stand alone for what I see when nobody else sees it.** I do feel a weight in my chest with contention, and I try to numb it out and push it down, but I suppose it manifests itself in my quick speaking selection of words.

Finding the right words to communicate something can be rough, and in an argument there's not a lot of time to think about it. I do my very best to disavow the use derogatory words and personal attacks. "Let no unwholesome words proceed from your mouth, but only such a word as is good for edification according to the need of the moment so that it will give grace to them that hear." I'm reciting that from the NASB. That's how long I've been wrestling with myself to do this verse.

You're not wrong that I'm a sensitive person. It's probably my longest indwelling sin. And it is a sin. "Great peace have they which love thy law, and nothing shall offend them." Being easily offended is really just an excrescence of not loving God's law enough. It's an outgrowth of God being less real to me than other people in that moment. Rather than being like Jesus who did not revile in return when he was reviled, but continued entrusting himself unto God who judges justly.

When I told you life would be hell for me if I didn't have a job by Aug 22, I was trying to open up to you, but you were more interested in my word selection than what I was trying to tell you. It made me feel like nobody is on my side. Nobody cares about my problems. **Nobody will actually listen to me because everybody is too busy finding faults in my language, or my preachers, and then I'm forced to defend myself, and the topic has shifted. I feel alone. Like it's me vs. the world. You're right. I am sensitive.** And that's by biggest flaw. So I do my best to bottle it in, and I do what I can numb how people hurt me, because I don't have the right to be hurt. So because I don't respond emotionally I'm always the aggressor in your sight. I'm always the recipient of your disapproval.

So in that moment I'm juggling how bad I feel, how guilty I feel for feeling bad, my suppression of how bad I feel, a composed tonality, and suitable word selection. 

No. I can't send this. It's shot through with feeling. That's a four let F word that can't be found on my lips if I would be righteous. This would be an attempt to help them understand me. To explain my behavior. But I don't need their apprival. I'll bear their judgment. Yes I will. If I am upright, I won't write a self-pitying letter about how hurt I feel. That's a snowflake move. It's not for men of God.
