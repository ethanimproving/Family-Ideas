It is utterly unthinkable that I will stumble upon by happenstance the exact algorithms that will challenge me in a technical interview. I can scarcely demand of my mind how to comprehend the solutions before me, much less fabricate them of my own thinking. I do not have peace in my bones, but anxiety. I need rest from the Lord. The rest of knowing I am working the right way. Rest from the fears that I am wasting my days and will run out of time.

I have sinned. I continue in it daily and it grieves my soul. From the lusts that wage war in my members, to the slothful movement of my hands as I turn over in bed, I am opposing the very path my feet are meant to walk on. I should be fierce but I am weak. I should work hard, but I deal with a slack hand. Apply yourself and apply your mind, Ethan! Forgive me for my transgressions, Lord, and give me what I need to succeed. I'm sorry for failing. I'm sorry for breaking your good and perfect commandments. I desire to walk in them day after day, but my flesh finds more power than my spiritual desires. Strengthen my new man to rule over the old and walk in the way you have prepared for me. Be gracious to me, Lord, according to your lovingkindness. Do not let me regret the life I live. Let me know I did everything you intended for me to do. Let me do it all. Starting with this study today.

Give me clarity. Give me focus. Give me understanding, I pray. You are the Lord. My time is in your hands. Make it fruitful I ask. In Jesus name, amen.
