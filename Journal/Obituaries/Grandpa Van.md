- Pulling Anna's pony-tail in the backyard **pool**.
- Grandma making us **shower** off after the pool.
- Adam standing up for me in Kindergarten against the "Nani Nani Boo Boo" **bully**.
- Cleaning up action figures and him giving me **batman**.
- Leaving his **light on all night**, I thought it would start a fire, and he laughed and assured me he does it all the time.
- He wanted to watch **Yu-Gi-Oh** and I said I wasn't allowed, and he insisted we watch it.
- He kissed my **butt** in the master bathroom at Leeward.
- We played in the **fountains** that shoot up after they took us to the **circus**.

Let me know if you need anything, to call or anything. 


Some of my earliest memories were at his house.


cleaning the action igures, watching yugioh.

I remember back when we used to swim in their backyard and when they took us to the circus. Those were some of my earliest memories.


I have good memories back when they used to let us swim in their backyard and take us to the circus. Some of my first memories. You were my first best friend in the earliest days of my life and you will be a friend in the last days of my life.

I remember back when we used to go swimming in their pool, go to the circus.

You were my first best friend in the earliest days of my life and you will be a friend in the last days of my life.
