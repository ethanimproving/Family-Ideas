How to stop being angry? Stop living to please people. Don't worry about disappointing anybody. The decisions you make are the decisions you make, and if they regret being nice to you because you didn't appreciate their gift enough, that's up to them.

# What are the sources of my anger?

- [ ] **Injustice**. Being treaty poorly at work, forced to come to work when sick, forced to come on time when it doesn't matter.
- [ ] **Overburdened**. When I am juggling too many things, I get overwhelmed because I can't focus on all of them at once. If someone slaps me on the shoulder while I'm focusing on something else, it irritates me. When I'm in the middle of writing to someone who needs an urgent reply (self imposed or otherwise) and Carol starts talking to me and asking me questions, I completely ignore her, and I'm irritated because it's rude to bother me when I'm clearly in the middle of responding to someone professionally.
- [ ] **Social Pressure**. Sometimes I get angry because of the sheer pressure I feel to please people. In other words, Carol might talk to me while I'm in the middle of responding to someone. I feel the need to respond as quickly as possible because I want to make a good impression. So it irritates me when Carol interupts me when I'm clearly in the middle of something.
