I just learned all over again that the reason I have severe depression is because I'm self-centered. If I was looking to the things of others, and concerned about helping them and lifting their continence, I wouldn't be so worried about how they view me. I wouldn't feel all the pressure of having to get girls so people think I have game. That's one root of depression: wanting to be thought of as high status, outgoing, and socially dexterous. But one surefire way to be depressed is to look into a mirror.
