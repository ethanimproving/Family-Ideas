Faith tried persuading me to change from watching a sermon to a TV show, and I said, "This will make you smarter, and give you wisdom, and help you know God, and grow in the knowledge and grace of the Lord Jesus Christ," and she said, "Elmo? Sesame street?" And I said, "You'll love this." And she subtly went away into moms room to the TV there. I wish she would have received instruction to want to grow instead of being amused, but I'm not going to falter. I'm not going to fold. This is the right thing to watch, and TV is a waste of time, and preaching is just as entertaining for them that love God. We're more into preaching than TV.

I prayed and Faith ended up returning after mom objected to Anderson preaching against Billy Graham and his repentence from sin gospel.
