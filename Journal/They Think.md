People in the world don't judge me for being IFB. They love me. They like triggering me to rant about the Mormons.

People in churches judge me big time. They don't like me. They think I think I'm better than them. And the funny thing is... they're dead right! Ask me who'd I'd rather be, a Christian who goes soul-winning or a Christian who doesn't, and I'll pick the Christian who goes soul-winning every time.

If I were to trade my lifestyle for theirs, I would objectively feel worse about myself than in my current lifestyle. To say I don't think I'm better than them would be fake humility, which they are full of.

> [!bible] [Philippians 2:3 - KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+2:3&version=kjv)
> 3. Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.

This does not mean, "Judge everybody's decisions as better than yours." This does not mean, "Approve the open and apathetic disobedience to the Great Commission in other Christians."

I'm not out to be better than anyone. I hope they all repent and correct their doctrine and their behavior. In that respect, I do esteem them better then myself. I want better things for them than for myself.

And in other ways, I esteem many people better than myself. Faith has better faith than I do. Nick has better faith than I do. Nick Connally, Jason West, Pastor Shelley, Matt, and others all are above me in spirituality. I don't have any envy about that, I'm amazingly happy to have people in my life to look UP to. But I'm not going to sit here and lie that Christians, who sit around in Bible study talking about how getting people saved can be about how you mow your grass well, are better than Christians who believe the Bible, take it seriously, and do it.
