Dear Jasleen,

I wanted to take a few minutes and share what a blessing it has been having you at Northlake this past year.

I have had the privilege of watching the kind of heart you have for the Lord. You have a special zeal for the things of God and it's extraordinary for a woman of your age. Don't let it grow dry. God can use you mightily for his kingdom and his glory, and there's no better purpose in life than that.

I see you growing into an amazing young woman who is seeking to grow closer to Christ. I look forward to hearing how God continues to use you, for the Bible speaks very clearly as to whom much is given, much is required. You, young lady, have a very rich set of qualities God has gifted you with.

One of my favorite things about you is that you have a devotion to God's word, and a heart that seeks reality, not just whatever sounds good. It's not only _that_ you read the Bible, but _how_ you read it. You have an inquisitive mind. This is a trait I wish every young believer had because it deepens your understanding of God's word. You aren't content to move past something you haven't reconciled with the rest of scripture. Every time I see you raise an objection to something I said, I've thought, "Yes! Yes! She's a Bible person!" because your objection is always immediately traced back to a chapter and verse. That is the mark of someone who is aiming to grow more closely with God, because we care about seeing God _as he is_. Affections always follow truth. They never precede it.

You are beautiful and strong and my prayer for you is that you continue to seek the Lord with all of your heart, and all of your strength, and all of your mind, and that you would always bow in perfect love to the supremacy of Jesus Christ in all things. The pleasures of God are so much stronger, and higher, and enduring than any competing loves, and I want that so much for you and all the saints at Northlake.

Matthew 5:8 says, "Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God." I want this to be your goal for 2020. Acquire 20/20 vision of Christ. The more clearly we see Christ, the more strongly we will treasure him. His beauty -- the beauty of holiness -- will trample underfoot every pleasure the world offers.

You are facing a season of life that will present many challenges and temptations ahead. Young men will give you attention and affection, and it will feel good. There will be a part of you that wants to compromise holiness to prove that you're desirable. Rebuke that thought. Make war with it. Arm yourself with scripture to defend yourself. Make yourself desirable to God.

The Lord has a calling for every single Christian, and I want that calling to give you purpose. He has called you to do your work with all your might. He has called you to share your faith with every creature. He has called you to serve the saints. He has called you to a blameless life, so that men will see your good works and glorify God.

I hope that when you read the Bible you fall in love with every page. But I know it's not always like that. So my second hope is that you have the faith to keep reading, and keep growing, and keep seeking even when it seems like a chore.

Keep your eyes fixed on Him--because He loves you and has amazing things planned out for you, and He delights in your life.

I've included a QR code that will take you to some videos that have helped motivate me to have a higher view of God.

Grace be with you,

Ethan
