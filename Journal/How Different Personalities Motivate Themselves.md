Deborah motivates herself by saying, "I'm worthwhile." It makes her happy, and [[Men Are Motivated By Challenge, Women Are Motivated By Praise|happiness gets her moving]].

I motivate myself by saying, "You're a worthless piece of trash who God would rather be dead than alive. Get a job and do something with your life. Become someone God doesn't want dead." It gives me vision. Vision gives me purpose. Purpose gets me moving.

When I'm happy I get lazy. I sleep in. I stop needing to improve myself, and I stop needing to change.

Two very different personalities.
