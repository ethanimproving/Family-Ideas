This photo was taken 4 years ago. Her smile was different back then. Brighter, fresher, full of life and vibrant dreams. She was almost ready to graduate college, the next chapter of her life unfolding. She was dating Felipe at the time, who was a perfect match for her.

I've made it my 7th mission in life to restore Mariana's love for life. To do that, I will have to face the fact that Felipe was a more beautiful love to her than the love she and I share. This is why [[Open Relationship|she isn't ready to get married]]. I've been avoiding the conversation about him because it does something to my heart in a painful way. It makes me feel bad to know that she loved him. Especially in a way that she doesn't love me. But if I'm going to be her comfort, and if there is any chance to restore the light in her eyes, I have to face these things. So let's begin.

[[Comparing Myself To Felipe]]

# Feb 17, 2022
> We had this connection in so many things, ==movies, songs, gossip, food==, I loved that he was so into ==sports== as I do. He always had ==something to say in order to help you==, he always ==wanted to help others== no matter if he had to travel to other state. And he always said this two things: “If you can and want to do something don’t miss the opportunity to do it and go for it” and “never skip the chance to be with your friends at least for a short time.” I learned a lot because of him and I’m still learning. So smart, intelligent, but also funny and always brought smiles to a lot of people. I was lucky too to had him in my life.

He sounds like a really sweat guy who was perfect for you in every way and a good leader, and I can see that he cared about people in the same way you do. I can see why you liked him. Maybe he was your ideal match and I don't know if you will find someone as good for you as he was. I don't want to pretend like Felipe didn't exist. You loved him and he was extremely dear to you.

Mariana wasn't ready to love someone again. She didn't want to tell me words she didn't mean, and when I said she did not love me, she didn't correct me.

This actually is hard to write. It's difficult to confront the fact that she valued Felipe so much compared to me. She doesn't love me. Not even now. Her heart died with Felipe. She doesn't smile the same way anymore. I don't make her happy the way he did. And it's time that I admit that to myself.

Maybe the solution isn't for me to admit that Felipe meant something to her. Maybe the solution isn't for me to let her say what she needs to say about him. Maybe the answer is that she needs someone like him, not someone like me. She gets frustrated at me. She respected him in ways she will never respect me. I don't blame her. I've removed my invisible cloak in front of her. I won't make that mistake with the next girl I fall in love with. Never let her see who you really are, Ethan. Because you are not a man worthy of praise. You are not a leader, and you are not a decision maker. You [[Ethan's Commitments#I am a leader|wrote down goals]] to override your natural lazy self. You can act like a leader, and you've even become a leader in several domains of life. But when you stop acting, who are you? That's why you have to act the rest of your life if you want a woman to respect you. You messed up with Mariana. Don't mess up with the next one.

We are from two different worlds. The things that are important to be aren't important to her. The things I want to do with my life don't make her happy. I've been trying to fit her into [[Life's Goals|the life I planned]] for myself, thinking that my plan was the best plan. So many other girls wanted to be with me, I thought the things I had to offer would make her happy. But I was fooling myself. I can't ask her to change her heart to love God. I can't make her change who she is. She loves [[Mariana's Likes|things that are opposed]] to my walk with God. I shouldn't waste anymore of her time. She won't break up with me because [[Region Beta Paradox|she won't accept the fact]] that I'm not the perfect person for her. She doesn't want to hurt me in that way. It's against her nature. But if I care about her, and if my mission is to restore her zest for life, I have to start by admitting the fact that her smile started fading when she started dating me, not when Felipe died. I am toxic for her. I am the problem. The most loving thing I can do for her is to break up with her.

Don't romanticize anything. Everything past is past. There's no changing it. The best move on the chess board is to let her go. I can't make her happy with the life I have planned. She will come with me, she will support me, but she will be miserable without the things she had in common with Felipe. Enough is enough. I don't care about sports. I can try to be interested, but it will never be what she needs. She needs someone from her own culture. Not me.
