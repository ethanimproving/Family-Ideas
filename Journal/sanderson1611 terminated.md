Try as you might, O darkness, to snuff me out, but I will burn brighter. Take away the sermons which I ignored, and I'll give them heed. Take away the freedoms of righteousness and I'll abound in them. Remove from me the teachings of God and I'll search them out the more. Take away Laodicia and I'll make the drive to Philadelphia. Blanchard is gone away, and his vision from Northlake. Brother John Ball is hurt in his legs, and crushed in his spirit. Then I will return to Stedfast and be twice the worker I was before.

I will not rest to revenge you one fold. You have taken the blessed words of my edification, even my salvation. I will arise early in the morning and meditate on the words of Christ. I will pray to God when I would have slept. I will labor to memorize the word of God when I would have turned over. I will sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs when I would have groaned in my bed. You will soon know the result of your temptations. It is my strong desire to forsake the worldly TV that held me in chains before I gained the resolve to break them in the strength Christ Jesus taught me. Lucifer is a lie, and the pleasure of his stories are poured out as an offering to God. I will not drink this water from the enemy's camp. God is my portion forever.
