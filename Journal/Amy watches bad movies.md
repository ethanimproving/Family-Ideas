I'm afraid that Amy won't want to live for God and chase holiness. I'm afraid that she'll want to watch R rated movies with straight up nudity. "The Boy Nextdoor." We don't do that in this family. I'm afraid she'll despise my militancy against it. I'm afraid she'll despise my standards. I've never seen so much as a trailer for Deadpool. I heard there was full frontal nudity. I thought, "Nobody I know will see that." But then Brandon said he not only saw it, but went with his family. And nobody raised an eyebrow. And Chris said he watched Game of Thrones, and nobody thought it strange except me. Are they all so desensitized? Does nobody have my conscience? Does nobody have the judgments of our Lord?

I want to go after God's will and not my fleshly desires. I don't care what girl I lose. I don't care what pseudo-godly people I arouse to oppose me. I'll fight with them all before I allow my conscience to become as seared and numb as theirs, and my vision so deluded that I think I'm worshipping Jesus because the music stirs me in Youth Group, all while I'm not reading my Bible but looking at smut on TV. I'll never choose that. That's not me. The whole world can think I'm a homeschooled weirdo who grew up under a rock and was never exposed to the world. Maybe I am. But I'd rather be the way I am than the way they are. **I'd rather be excluded from friendship than included with sin.** God is more real. More important. I will live for him no matter what the cost.
