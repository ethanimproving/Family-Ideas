As an adolescent it was such a privilege to be able to walk around the neighborhood during the day. Being homeschooled allowed me a lot of freedom to follow my imagination wherever it led. An army man in the drainage system, the trails by the Bridge on Park and Mobile, or walking simply to Friendship Park. I used to pray on my walks. There's something therapeutic about being outside in a quiet neighborhood. I had a crush on Kerri Shomette, so I walked by her house in hopes that she would be there.

Life was quieter back then. There were no bills being sent for late payments, mission trips using non-rev privileges to be stressed about, friends pressuring you to marry your girlfriend, time running out to buy a house. I didn't have to answer to someone for how I spent my time. In some sense, childhood is a taste of heavenly peace. It's a foreshadowing of what we will return to when our work is over. No more stress, no more worries, taken care of by God.

But the Bible says that we're supposed to live like that even now. What are you worried for?

> [!Bible] [Matthew 6:25-33 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/matthew+6:25-33?translation=kjv)
> 25. Therefore I say unto you, ==Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on==. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?
> 26. Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?
> 27. Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?
> 28. And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:
> 29. And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
> 30. Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, ==shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith==?
> 31. Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?
> 32. (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for ==your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things==.
> 33. But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.

You don't need to take account of your life. Yes, redeem the time, but stop worrying about the outcome. Focus on the [[Leading Indicators|leading indictors]], and God will take care of the outcome. Enjoy walks again. You have fallen into the extreme of trying to be so productive you've forgotten to relax and trust God. Don't spend your entire life behind a computer writing programs that are meant to aid in your relationship with God. The book in your hand will accomplish that without the aid of your [[App Ideas|technology dreams]].

The only time you go outside is for a run. That is a picture of how you have come to believe that you must be accomplishing something productive with [[Schedule|every minute of your time]]. You need to unlearn that lesson. Walk with the Lord. Walk, don't run. It is when you are walking that [[Coming In Late#Ride Inspiration Until It Ends|inspiration strikes]], not when you are running. Give your brain time to breathe without any need to be productive, and often times that is when it becomes the most productive. We see some of our most awe inspiring thoughts while we are in the shower, because no matter who you are, the shower is one place that we don't push ourselves to multitask. We are naked, away from technology, and away from the tools that allow us to give our time to our goals. These moments are precious, not wasteful. Learn to allocate time for doing nothing as you are living your life.
