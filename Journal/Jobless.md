I feel outstandingly lazy. I'm not smart enough to memorize these algorithms. I don't have the capacity to carry the state of all the moving parts in my mind long enough to code the solution. I can code. I can debug. And I can find solutions better than 90% of the coders in the industry. But I'm astonishingly bad at technical interview questions. I need a different method.

Maybe I'm neurodivergent. I always put videos on 2x speed or I lose concentration. And when I read, I can't read fast enough to keep myself focused. My mind wanders. I need to sharpen my mind. But time will run out. The resources I have form my Father will run out. I need to work at it, but I'm so uninterested. I need to find a way to be interested in learning algorithms.

To support Mariana. To pay for the house. What's the worst that could happen? I lose what I've been given. I've heard this story before in the books of wisdom. If the Lord gives and the Lord takes, blessed be the name of the Lord. If my life goes a different way from here, the last years were better than I could have asked.

I should have followed the Lord. I withheld my tithe for greedy lucre's sake. I wanted to give the world to Mariana. I always intended to start again. But days turned into weeks turned into months.

I have sinned against the Lord in multiple ways. I never deserved the life I had. It was all grace. And still my life is grace. It's a curse to borrow and a blessing to lend, and even in my impoverished state the Lord prepared by table large enough to seat one close to me. Adam has taken my house. His situation is worse than mine. His girlfriend has betrayed his love in laying with another man. His skillsets were never given the opportunity to grow. His work ethic is strong, but his skills need to grow. His ambition can be realized if he's just given space to grow. And I pray for this to be his opportunity. He doesn't need to worry about rent or utilities. He does need to worry about food. But maybe that's just enough to springboard him into something more advanced.

As for me, I know there's a promise of a better life. It's the life after repentance. The life if I give up the difficult sins. The life when I withhold the sweet fruit of love from my lips. I can restrain myself as long as distance finds a place between us. But when she is here, I cannot refuse my desire for her. It's unbeatable. And for this reason, I am a byword. What are my next steps? I can study hours on end, but my opportunity to fix the state of my life will come from the Lord. It is his Word and his righteousness that I must seek, not these algorithms. He will give me the strength of mind I need, or withhold it. He will give me the preparation I need, or withhold it. He will give me the wisdom I need, or withhold it. He will give me the discipline I need, or withhold it. Every good and perfect gift comes from the Lord.

Father, I can't promise my purity. I wish I could give it to you but I know myself. I'm not strong. I'm not perfect as I'm called to be. But I pray for at least this: give me the strength to refuse the sins that tempt me when distance is between my girlfriend and me. There are temptations I can battle. There are battles I can win. There are fights I can fight. And if I use your Word as my weapon, there are victories promised. Give my that strength, and that training. Give me this hope, to draw a little bit closer to you. My life will be in shambles if I do not have your favor. Prepare for me a better life than I've ever had. A life of purity, and a life of righteousness. This is what I hunger for. This is what I find desire in my reigns to obtain. This is where I find purpose, in following the paths laid out for me by God in the Holy Scriptures.

I love you Lord. Increase my love.

Amen.
