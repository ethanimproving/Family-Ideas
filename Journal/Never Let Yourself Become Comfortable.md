[Don’t ever be comfortable at work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xShl6aDZz0k)
# Embracing Discomfort for Growth

Kritika gave me good advice yesterday, which is you can never be comfortable. As soon as you're at a position at your job when you're comfortable, you stop growing, you stop learning, and you become lazy.

## The Pitfall of Comfort

Because what happens is you say, "Oh, I'm comfortable, so I don't want to go to another job, I don't want to go anywhere else." So you stay stagnant.

## Fear of Becoming Like Adults

This is what I've always feared about adults. I looked at adults and thought they're brainless; they lack the capacity for new ideas. They don't change their minds; they've just cemented and lost the ability to engage with new information or different perspectives.

I feared that's what would happen to me – that I would become cemented into whatever belief system I have currently and then lose the ability to grow, learn, and engage with people.

## Stagnation at American Airlines

It's been 4 years since I've started at American Airlines, and there are reasons I don't want to leave. I'm comfortable, not happy, but comfortable. I can do what I'm doing in my sleep. I'm in a groove where they don't assign me work; I find my own work.

## The Illusion of Extra Time

Even if I have a big workload at another company, I don't have to work extra. Those eight hours are gone. Whether I'm working hard or being lazy, those eight hours are gone.

### Embracing Challenge for Personal Growth

By joining a new company or a new team, I'm not telling myself I'll be working overtime. It's the same eight hours, but I won't be lazy. I'll be pressing into the work, learning new things, and it will be helpful for other areas of my life.

## Sharpening the Mind

Think of it as sharpening an axe. It challenges your mind, makes it sharper. You can think of it as a budget – if you spend all your [[Focus and Mental Energy|mental energy]] at work, you won't have any left for the rest of the day.

## Use It or Lose It

The Bible says, "By reason of use." If you're not using your senses, your mind, and not engaging with the work, change jobs. Don't become comfortable. Switch, challenge yourself, get a new job, go somewhere else. Don't stay in the same spot; reach for new things. Don't ever let yourself be comfortable and stagnant in your career.

**Peace out.**
