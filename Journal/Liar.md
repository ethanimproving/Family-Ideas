I think this nigger is lying to me. He told me he biked to a Walmart 10 minutes away, and applied at multiple places on the way back. What he doesn't know is that I have motion detection on my cameras that records events of people coming in and out of my house. On that day, he was only gone for 20 minutes. That's not enough time to even talk to the manager at Walmart.

Today he told me a girl named Kimberly came by the house on Saturday and they went to the lake. She asked him on a date because they had been talking awhile. When I checked the cameras, he never left the house. So why would he lie to be about that? He feels like such a loser that he needs to pretend like a girl is pursuing him to protect his ego? To give himself a good name? Okay. If that's what he needs, then I'll believe him. It doesn't cost me anything. Maybe my cameras didn't pickup the motion. Despite my hesitations, I will choose to give him the benefit of the doubt because charity believeth all things.

> [!bible] [1 Corinthians 13:7 - KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+13:7&version=kjv)
> 7. Beareth all things, ==believeth all things==, hopeth all things, endureth all things.

Why should I care if he is lying to me? The only motive he has to lie is because he values what I think about him. That's not something for me to be angry about. The job situation he may lie about to be in my favor so that I keep supporting him. To be honest, I don't really care about that either. Even if he wasn't "busting butt" to get a job, I would understand. He's just been through heart ache. It's rough to motivate yourself to give everything you have when you have (1) the ability to stay in bed, and (2) you're depressed. Depression is when you're worried about the past, anxiety is when you're worried about the future, and happiness is when you're living in the moment. He's upset about the past right now. Let him grieve. On one hand, I don't want to enable him to slump into a self-destructive depression where he comes to an all time low because I took away his need to look for a job, but on the other hand, give him some time. I don't expect more from him than I expect form myself. He doesn't have a huge opportunity pool of jobs to "bust his butt" looking for without a car. I understand that. He doesn't want to be in this situation, I have full confidence he will climb out of it, but he needs somebody to take care of him the same way my dad took care of me and his dad never did. It doesn't bother me if he's depressed for awhile laying in bed. He didn't choose how he feels. His circumstances did. I know what it's like to be so low that motivating yourself to get out of bed seems impossible. And those times pass. He needs time to recalibrate. Let him recalibrate.

So I don't really care if he's lying to me. It doesn't change my course of action either way, so I may as well believe him when he says it. And if that's the case, good for him. I'm proud of him for being strong enough to keep going even under emotionally paralyzing circumstanced. And if he is lying to me, it doesn't change anything. He will get through it. I understand. I'm not mad at him.

I had a great dad to teach me how I should be like. Adam had a dad that showed him what he doesn't want to be like. With that in mind, I would say he's doing pretty good. He hasn't committed suicide. He has stayed away from cocaine. He's a polite person with good manners. He isn't a libtard looking for free handouts. And even when he is accepting help, his attitude is gratefulness rather than entitlement. He never asked me for anything. He expressed his problems and I offered to help. Is he using tactics to take advantage of me? Who cares. Babies use tactics. They cry to get what they need. They throw a tantrum to receive comfort and attention. The little demons. And nobody is mad at them. That's how life works. You push the button that delivers what you need. If you've figured out that gratefulness allows you to stay longer than entitlement, you'd be stupid to be entitled. Discerning what works and doing it is called wisdom. Discerning the gift of salvation and accepting it is wisdom. "Well he's not grateful in his heart, only for show." At least he's smart enough to act grateful. And anyway I don't believe that, I do believe the best in him. I think he's got a good heart. If I'm wrong, I haven't lost anything. I'm willing to risk it by betting on him. That's what believing in someone means.
