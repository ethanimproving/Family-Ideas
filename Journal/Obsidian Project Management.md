# Lack of Structure

I need to get better at defining and delegating tasks. The biggest gap in my [[Ethan Miller#Emergenetics|Emergenetics Profile]] is **structure**. That's what I need to improve on.

I could have enlisted help to work on my house today, but I wanted to sleep in and go when I feel like it. You can't ask for other people's time that way. I can get my [[Oakmore Renovations Task List|projects]] done faster 

- [Obsidian Projects](https://github.com/marcusolsson/obsidian-projects) / DataView
- [Obsidian Kanban](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban)
- Git Issues
- [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/uGCjQ0NU/oakmore-renovation)
- [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/)
- AzureBoards

Resources don't have to have access to the Kanban Board. As long as I have access, I can assign people their tasks.
