I've sometimes internally contested the Emergenetics conclusion that I lack structure.  With all of the schedules I create, and how I track my tasks every day, how could it be said I lack structure? But it's starting to make sense. Tracking tasks isn't structure. It's analysis, which scored 32% of my [[Ethan Miller#Emergenetics|personality traits]]. What I lack is the **discipline** to do the things I don't want to do. I'm perfectly good at defining things to do, and analyzing metrics in how and when I do them, but actually getting myself out of bed to clean my room or read my Bible is where I lack. And now that I've identified my problem, I'm going to find ways to make the trait of discipline greater than my spontaneity so that people around me would assume I'm a type A personality.

I was the most shy, anti-social, mumbling, reserved person imaginable until I identified that as a gap in my personality and [[Fun With Friends|fixed it]]. Through soul-winning, Six Flags, traveling, and prioritizing friends over projects I transformed my personality so that now I'm much more naturally social, my Emergenetics scored 31% social. Randell literally came over smiling just to ask, "I want to see your social score." If I can do that for social, I can do that for structure. People will come over and ask, "I want to see your structure." How can I be a disciple without discipline? It's in the name.

# Stop Letting Motivation Run Your Life

[The Emotions of Jesus Christ - Bro. Dillon Awes](https://rumble.com/v46u6to-the-emotions-of-jesus-christ-bro.-dillon-awes-stedfast-baptist-church.html?start=3088)

There’s something Jesus had to do that he didn’t want to do. He grieved but he did it anyway. **Stop letting motivation run your life. Just do what you need to do. That’s called discipline**. 

> [!bible] [Matthew 26:36-39 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Matthew+26:36-39?translation=kjv)
> 36. Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples,
Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.
> 37. And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.
> 38. Then saith he unto them, ==My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death==: tarry ye here, and watch with me.
> 39. And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, ==let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt==.

# Indhu

Indhu said I need discipline to become a level 4. I already have talent. I already have knowledge. What I lack is discipline. You will not always be motivated to read your Bible. You need discipline to do what you don’t want to do. [[Procrastination]] is not wanting to do what you need to do.

# Good Things Get In The Way

I’ve become [[Never Let Yourself Become Comfortable|comfortable]]. Because I’m gifted I never learned to do things I don’t want to do. Sometimes you will be motivated to work on programming when you need to read your Bible. You’ll get a wave of motivation for [productive things that get in the way of what you need to do](https://youtu.be/0YIQU3ghv0M?si=JfVaSIFFV5tl0TOH&t=84). Learn to sacrifice the items you are motivated to [[Structure vs Hyper Focus|hyper focus]] on and get done the items that you are obligated to get done. (You are obligated to go to be in time to wake up in time to get the tasks for the next day done.)

# Don't Sleep In From Late Night Research

Your sleep will get in the way. You’ve slept enough. Go to bed in time and wake up in time. Don’t stay up researching nutrition because you’re motivated. I’m a type B personality. 

# The Main Point

Most people go through life only doing the things they feel motivated to do. You need to do things you don’t feel like doing. That’s called discipline. When Jesus was in the garden he didn't want to be nailed to a cross the next day, and he stood there sweating drops of blood and did it anyway.

# Balance

Most things in life are about centering yourself between two extremes. On the one hand I've written profuse and compelling arguments about the [[Coming In Late|benefits of Type B personality traits]]:
- Riding motivation until it dies.
- Focusing on results rather than hours clocked.
- Working when you're most productive.
- Less stress, healthier life, healthier mind.
- [[Structure vs Hyper Focus|Hyper-focus]] lending itself to unprecedented productivity.

On the other hand there are [[Don't Be a Lazy Jerk! - Bro. Dillon Awes|benefits of Type A personality traits]]:
- Dependability.
- Predictability.
- Feeling productive.
- Having a clean room, clean mind, and organized life.
- Doing what you don't feel like doing.
	- Eating healthy.
	- Working out.
	- Reading your Bible.
- Delivering on time.
- Enlisting help through organized [[Obsidian Project Management|project management]].

My battle is not to choose which benefit set I want to add to my belt, as though one set cancels the other, but how to develop my character and personality traits to accommodate the benefits of both. Just like Jesus said, "[[Do Justice, Love Mercy|Do justice and love mercy]]." That sounds like it cancels out on the surface, but a deeper inspection shoes you can do what's right and not get upset when others don't. That's the best way to live.

In the same way, I can be relaxed like a Type B personality, provided calm to the environment like Bob from the Situational Awareness team, but still show up on time. I don't have to be internally stressed and rushed to get out of bed at the right time, shower for the right duration, and leave at the right hour. All I need is a wake-up light, a schedule, and the discipline to follow through on my commitment. Discipline doesn't necessitate stress. You don't have to care so much that you stress yourself out. You can form proper habits without stress. And then when you have a habit of leaving on time, you're actually going to be *less* [[Stress Is An Indicator Of Action|stressed]] because you're not worried about arguing with Indhu.

## False Dichotomies

The problem with personality studies is that they create false dichotomies of "social vs. structured," but the true goal is to view all of those traits as areas of personal development. Become proficient at all of them.
