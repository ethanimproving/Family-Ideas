Blessed is the man whose transgressions are forgiven.

I am back, as if I’d never left. After two years, I have returned to the place where I had hope and doubt, but through it all clung to Christ. I remember Caleb across the room, and it seems as though his bed is even there. I am back where it feels like home. By bed is again by the window, and my desk below it. God, I pray that I will find you in these days. Speak O Lord your word to me. Make me know the truth of the gospel of Christ, and cleanse me from all filthiness.  I love you. Amen.
