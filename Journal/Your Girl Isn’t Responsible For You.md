Men have been tricked into thinking relationships are a partnership, but they still want the authority. In most cases your girl will give you the leadership role by default based on the way you make decisions. But you still expect her to take care of you. My friend, if you want to be the leader, then a you can take care of yourself and her. If you want a partnership then you take care of each other. But if you want to be the leader, don’t get butt hurt when you are the one asking about her meals, her sleep, and her well being without receiving reciprocal questions.

You don’t expect your children to take care of you. Why? Because you are responsible for them. They aren’t responsible for you. And if you’re the leader in the relationship, you are responsible for your wife. She isn’t responsible for you.

Stop taking all the benefits of authority over your girl and expecting all the benefits of a partnership too.
