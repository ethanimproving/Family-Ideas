# Mom

I've disappointed mom somehow. She's stopped smiling to see me. She has stopped declaring her love for me years ago. About the time I departed on my journey to win the lost to Christ. I left the church of my upbringing.

When I was a kid, anything I learned was praised by my mom. She would tell me I'm smart, or wonder what I would grow up to be. I told her everything I thought about. Until one day, those thoughts started to offend her. Specifically my thoughts about doctrine. Salvation is by faith alone, modern Bible versions corrupt the original text, missionaries should preach the gospel, and preaching against sin should be as God prescribed.

> [!bible] [Ezekiel 6:11 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Ezekiel+6:11?translation=kjv)
> 11. Thus saith the Lord GOD; ==Smite with thine hand, and stamp with thy foot==, and say, Alas for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel! for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.

Sharing the gospel should be about the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ, the preaching of foolishness, not my changed life. Drinking any alcohol is a sin. There are those who have rejected Christ, holding the truth in unrighteousness, and it is too late for them to be saved because God has hardened their heart and given them over to a reprobate mind. Homosexuals are beyond the reach of salvation, and as such I give them no ministry or compassion.

I've departed from all the teachings of Northlake. And now, their example confirms my choice to leave was God ordained. They have women teachers, a woman youth pastor, and an unqualified pastor who's daughter was made pregnant outside of marriage. If he cannot rule his own children, how can he rule the house of God? They buy and sell in the house of God. They neglect the first works and do no preaching of the gospel. They have forsaken the King James Bible and preached out of the Passion Bible, from a false prophet who added a 22nd chapter to the book of John. And that before children.

I've let that part of my life go to the past. I've forsaken the corrupt ways of contemporary Christianity, and followed the old paths, wherein is the good way. The Baby Boomer generation was the worst generation in recent history. They ushered in the sexual revolution, they corrupted Christianity with fake tolerance, they've protected the homosexuals.

It's not hard to imagine why my mother is not proud. Either she is not proud of me, or she is not proud of herself. But I find no repentance in her soul, and therefore I conclude she is disappointed in me. So be it. Losing the love of your mother is the hardest loss in a young man's life. But if God calls me into the world, my feet dare not stay at home. I will embrace the love of my Father in heaven. Even a mother does not love like the Father.

My mother is antagonistic against my church. She disagrees with their style of preaching. And I disagree with the church she raised me in. The difference is that my church preaches the Bible and her church preaches the wisdom of the current culture in the West. We are at odds.

Forsaking conversation about all of that, I desired to speak to her about other things. But she gives me no ear. She is not interested in what I have to say about the Bible. She will not listen, neither respond. She is closed off to me. Maybe I've hurt her in the past and she is not open anymore. In any case, it hurts. If my mom died tomorrow, I would have little change in my life. I would have to do my own laundry and cook my own meals, but I wouldn't lose a single conversation in my life.

Years from now when she is gone, I would give anything to speak to her one more time. Now is that time, and there's ice in the air. She doesn't love me anymore. I don't know how to win her back. I don't know what would make her proud of me. But I do know what would make dad proud of me, so I'll work towards that. I need to reinstate my career, get married, and bear grandchildren for him. I need to build a life and establish myself. That will make him proud.

Yet when I have all of that, I wonder if my mom will despise my children. I imagine her being heartless towards them because they came from me. They will be raised with my ideologies. I will give so much diligence to their spiritual well being that I never received. I will parent them and take care of their development socially, spiritually, physically, and psychologically. These are the things I will not neglect. My life's goal is to do everything for my children that I wish was done for me. And I'm sure that hurts my mother.

She should not feel inadequate. My parents did the best job they could. They raised me with principles, and they raised me in church. They gave me the Bible and told me to believe it. I would not be a New Independent Fundamental Baptist if I was not raised as a Southern Baptist. They didn't raise me Pentecostal. They didn't raise me Methodist. The raised me Baptist. They didn't send me to the government to raise me in their school system. I was raised at home. My mother stayed home with us, forsaking a career to take special care and attention to raising us. The government raised all the other kids. They were given condemns while I was give the word of God. They were given to fornication while I was running spotlight for the Easter Musical. They were watching movies with nudity while I was restricted from watching Dragon Tales. They played shooter games while I wasn't allowed to play PokÃ©mon. They listened to profanity while I wasn't allowed to listen to Christian Rock, until I was. While other kids were vaccinated yearly, I was not given any unclean thing. They protected me from more than any other parents in my generation. They took special care of us, and as such I am a greater man than any of my peers. I am the only one from all my friends that grew up to evangelize the lost. I am the only one with feet shod with the preparation of the gospel. I am the only one who searched diligently for the truth so that I would not give my affections to false views about God. I am the only one who forsook TV for years in the attempt to see God. I am the only one who searched the Bible to make my life conform to God's plan as he says, not as the culture says. My mom should be very proud of the job she did, to set the groundwork for who I am today. I would not have graduated to strong meat if I was not giving the milk early in my life. For all of that I am extremely grateful, and I hope she knows that before she dies.

# Dad

My father is the one who turned around [[The Miller Line|the Miller bloodline]] to God. He is the one who broke 7 previous generations of false faith and trusted the Bible over tradition or cultural sway. For 5 generations the Millers were part of the heretical Methodist church, starting with David Anderson Miller, who migrated to Ohio during the Second Great Awakening, when frontier areas like Ohio experienced significant growth in Methodism. This was 5 generations of false faith plaguing the Miller bloodline with damnable heresy, [teaching works salvation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodism), and that being saved is a process. My father alone turned away from that lie when he was challenged to read the Bible for himself, trusted Christ above tradition, and was born again. "In the days of Theo, the Millers began to call upon the name of the Lord." He evangelized his brothers and won them to Christ. Gary, Rick, and Colleen all became believers through my dad, directly or indirectly. ==He was the pioneer of faith in my family==, and I am carrying that torch forward. If we had 5 generations of heresy, would to God that we gain 10 generations of faith.

His name was aptly chosen for him by [coincidental prophesy](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+11%3A50-51&version=KJV), [Theodore](https://www.thebump.com/b/theodore-baby-name) being interpreted "gift from God," signifying his role in reminding our lineage that *eternal life* is the gift of God, not the wages of men. [James](https://www.thebump.com/b/james-baby-name), meaning, "supplanter," because the Old Baptist Paths would supplant the 18th century heretical doctrines of John Wesley. "Theodore James Miller" because the doctrine of eternal life as the gift of God would supplant 5 generations of the Miller tradition.

> [!bible] [Jeremiah 6:16 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Jeremiah+6:16?translation=kjv)
> 16. Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ==ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein==, and ye shall find rest for your souls.

He worked diligently as a Systems Architect so that my mom could keep the home and instill their faith in my 5 siblings and me. He is a good man, and my desire is to build on the work that he has done for our bloodline. He has created an upbringing to springboard me into greater works. All of my physiological needs were met, safety and security, love and belonging, to let me start out my life on the 4th level of Malow's Hierarchy. I wasn't too preoccupied with the lower levels of survival to climb higher. It would have been a wasted opportunity to neglect finding purpose for my life, learning high-level skills.

My father was smart, and as such I too became highly intelligent. I outperform any of my peers in every domain because of him. He trained me in maths when I was 3 years old. I was taught logic as a child. College was child's play.

As a teenager I resented his rules, but as an adult I find them life-giving. I am [[Title 3 - Media|building upon them]]. As a teenager I considered him a hard man, and unreasonable. As an adult, I aspire to treat others with half the diplomacy I observe in him. He is wiser than I gave him credit for, and I was a fool. Slowly I am learning that he was a better man than I ever realized.

I am taking the good doctrine of my father and tightening it up further. Let this faith progress in future generations, and not retreat.
