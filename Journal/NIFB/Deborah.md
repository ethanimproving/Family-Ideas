Deborah, I wanted to write you to let you know that Nexus is a compassionate woman. She's a godly young woman, and she has asked how you are doing many occasion's.  And ==whenever I tell her about a girl I like or took on a date, she asks me if I can picture her or submitting to me==. The truth is, Nexus is loud and she's Blunt, but she does her darnedest to be shamed face it is the Lord has commanded women to be, And to submit to her husband as the church submits to Christ, the weighted The Bible tells wives to submit to their husbands. And the truth is when she's out there knocking doors, the reason she does that is because she has compassion for the lost , in the thought of even a stranger going to h***, where the beast and the false prophet are, where they will be tormented day-and-night for ever and ever, is too great, too horrible to allow her to not preached the gospel to them, to leave them at the door and never confront them with The good news of Jesus Christ. I know that sometimes we can seem like we're rough around the edges, but if you spend enough time to see what's  In the center, I think you may see something surprising. When someone needed a seat, pastor Shelley was the 1st to give his up, and sat on half of a seat beside the bus. Every time I ask pastor Shelley a question that maybe deviates from something hes preached about, hes happy to talk about it with me. He never gives me any weird  Looks, or indicates that I'm stupid for believing something he is believe. He treats all of my questions as valid common and all of my interpretations as note worthy, and worthy of consideration, and worthy of response. He has even  I dressed some of the things that I asked him about in his sermons.

I lost my wallet one time, and Jacob was quick to pay for me I get was nothing. $12 he was happy Khama and he when Lemmy band back either. The next time I lost my wallet, brother Matt illy said he would pay for me. And they don't act like it's anything at All.

When I told brother Jeff that I thought the dietary laws of the Old Testament were still in effect, he gently and considerately Took me to a passage that said every creature was to be received with Thanksgiving. And I change my mind.My 1st week there brother Chris invited me to lunch with him. In every week we go out to lunch. Every week brother Jesse's happy and excited to see me, in treats me like I'm a faithful church member.Every time we see each other it is in just another Sunday, we're all thrilled that weMade it another week, and were being faithful another week, and were being steadfast in abound in the work of the board another week. It isn't just a casual thing to shove to church. It encourages every one of us to keep coming every week when we see each other coming every week.

At steadfast we talk about The Bible.And I makes me feel included.

One brother Jacob was poking fun at a false prophet named Adam Fanon for saying in his sermon, let it roll instead of let it ride, and insinuating that Adam fan and was a gambler, brother Tim stopped him and said that wasn't good enough evidence to accuse him, and said that he wouldn't rail a.

When there was a Calvinistic our church pastor Shelley didn't just throw him out, but talk to him after the service, and asked him questions rather than quoting verses to him the period

I know that Nexus has nonchalant eyes, and allowed in Blunt tonality, but that isn't a reflection of a lack of compassion in her heart. 

Compassion isn't the way you look at someone. It's not even the tone of voice that you engage them with. Compassion in the KJV usually means when somebody does you wrong, and you forgive them. The wors I think you mean by it is what the KJV calls cherity, which comes from the root word "caring." Its when you care about someone.

She isn't just a man hungry cougar. She cares.

Deborah, I want ti ask you a question, and I'm just going to listen to you, and not respond, but I want to know why you said we lack compassion? Because that's something that we need to work on if that's the report we have from outsiders, and everyone at Stedfast wants to take the Bible seriously.

Why is it that we don't have compassion? 

To steadfast:

Hey guys, my sister has said the vibe she gets is that we're not compassionate. And I know that's easy to write off, but it's really a terrible report to have, and it's something to work on.
