[The best AI tools to help you make videos](https://www.facebook.com/reel/175308241934413?fs=e&s=TIeQ9V&mibextid=0NULKw)

1. Hey ChatGPT! Can you make me a 5 minute video script about "Anik Singal"?
2. Go to [speechify.com](https://speechify.com/) and upload the text ChatGPT generated. It will generate an audio file speaking out that script.
3. Upload the audio file to [invideo.io](https://invideo.io/)  and click create video.
4. Optionally, if you want to create a face video, go to [movio.la](https://www.heygen.com/?from=moviola) to output a video of the person.

These 3 niches are popular:
1. Health
2. Wealth
3. Relationships

Take those videos, upload them to YouTube, and create a least one a day.

Other topics:
- Science of products/alternative medicines.
- History videos.
- Technology videos.
- Clip sermons instead of generating a script.
- Only 15% of the world speaks English. Use AI to translate videos into other languages to reach more people.
- Run Headway books through Jarvis.
- Run New IFB sermons through Jarvis.

The world is productive enough. I don't need to be concerned about creating product. We live in an age where the greatest commodity is attention and information. In order not to be left behind, the most cutting edge people are making money easily online with AI tools and content creation rather than working hard at the mercy of an employer. ==There will always be enough slaves in the world to make the food and the cars. You don't have to be one of them==. And neither does anybody else. You can spend your whole life trying to liberate people from the slave mindset, and only a small substrata of people will ever get off of their butts long enough to realize they're in the matrix.

Go to YouTube and see what's trending about what you want to talk about. Run it, hit the video, get [otter.ai](https://otter.ai/) because it dictates what the speaker is saying. Take that content and run it through [Jarvis](https://www.jasper.ai/?source=partner&fpr=denise1008&gclid=CjwKCAjw__ihBhADEiwAXEazJqMq3XK_A0GBwz5NgNqTlTcyVZ1VfP0ygHJHTGYIRA69DiZDu9x_VRoCF0AQAvD_BwE) and put it on your website as a blog.
