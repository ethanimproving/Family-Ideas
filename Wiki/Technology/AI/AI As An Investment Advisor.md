I have two friends to make money simply by having automated a set of [[Technical Analysis|trading rules]] that get executed by systems they maintain. Market action triggers their entry rules and exit rules, and they make money. He sent me the code as an attachment in [an email](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ik=e8fcb44b62&view=om&permmsgid=msg-f:1716256394683914834),

- Dictate videos from Dave Johnson iBullyBear session, run them through AI, and extract the trading rules and principles from his sessions. Use AI to create a trading bot that implements these trading rules through an automated process.

I once thought that [[Technology (Digital Revolution)#AI-McDonalds: Fully Automated Fast Food|salary should be tied to output]], but after realizing how much GDP exists in the world without me, I no longer care. We already live in a world of abundance, created by slaves at the bottom and money as the middle man.  A slave would have a place to stay, food, and a job. A working class person making $50,000 only has enough money to afford food, a place to stay, and a job. It's effectively the same lifestyle. So we are slaves of people richer than us. Machines create the majority of the goods and services in the world, and it gets funneled to the elites through extortion, usury, lobbying, and other unethical practices. ==I feel no moral obligation to contribute to a system that will harvest the output of my labor and channel it to a gluttonous psychopath in charge of the current power base==. There is [[Total Global Economy|enough in the world already]], the problem is distribution. If I can find a way to channel money to myself, I don't care if I earned it as long as I did not transgress ethical lines. If I can make money trading options, making YouTube videos, etc, my net contribution to the world was zero. But if I spend my entire life programming for American Airlines, that doesn't matter either. My contributions would be consumed at the top, and without me, another person would have filled that role and benefitted from it. If I can make money without producing anything valuable, that will free me up to do more [[Life's Goals|meaningful work]]. I can do the things I want to do instead of the things I have a duty to do.

People in Gen Z don't want to work for McDonalds when they can make money on TikTok. I no longer take issue with that. As long as you are smart enough to have some method of making money, avoid being a slave.
