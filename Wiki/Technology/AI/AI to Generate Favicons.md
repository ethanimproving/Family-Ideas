# Digital Garden Art

A colored SVG that can be used as a favicon for my Digital Garden. The image needs to be simple enough that it can be seen clearly as a favicon. It can be a square circuit board with the circuit patterns forming tree limbs and tree roots. Maybe roots or tree limbs can double as chip circuit patterns.

It should be designed in a way that also resembles a brain.

Brain circuit-board tree. The tree leaves and limbs should be circuits and create the shape of a brain. Make it simple enough to display as a tiny icon, but detailed enough to recognize the 3-fold multivalent: brain, circuit, tree.

The middle of the brain should be a processor chip. The trunk of the tree can also be circuits, with 5 parallels circuits at the base of the trunk to signify roots. Make it simple enough to be visible as the favicon of a website, but detailed enough to get the tri-symbolism across: brain, circuits, tree. It's for my digital garden.
