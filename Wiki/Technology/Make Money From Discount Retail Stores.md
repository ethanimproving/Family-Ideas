# Amazon FBA (Fulfillment By Amazon)
If you are making less than $100K a year and unhappy with your job, you should quit and sell items on Amazon.


> **Retail arbitrage**: the practice of buying products from a brick-and-mortar shop, usually a supermarket or a Big Box Store (Walmart, Target, etc.), and then selling it online for a profit.

1. Download the [Amazon Seller App](https://sell.amazon.com/tools/amazon-seller-app)
2. Scan the UPC Bar Code on each product to determine the item's profit margin.
3. Ship all the items to Amazon Warehouse. They will take care of shipping it to customers when the items are sold.

# Is Retail Arbitrage Legal?

The first-sale doctrine is a legal concept that allows a purchaser of a copyrighted or trademarked item to resell or otherwise dispose of that item without permission from the copyright or trademark owner. The doctrine applies to physical items like books, CDs, and DVDs, as well as digital files like software and music downloads.

In the context of retail arbitrage, ==the first-sale doctrine allows sellers to purchase branded items from retail stores like Ross or TJ Maxx at a discounted price and then resell them on Amazon or other marketplaces without infringing on the trademark rights of the brand owner==. As long as the items are genuine and legally obtained, the first-sale doctrine allows the seller to resell the items without permission from the brand owner.

However, it's important to note that the first-sale doctrine has limitations. For example, it doesn't apply to items that have been illegally obtained, like counterfeit goods or stolen merchandise. Additionally, the doctrine doesn't allow sellers to modify or alter the items in any way that would create a new copyrighted or trademarked work.

In summary, the first-sale doctrine is a legal concept that allows sellers to resell branded items without infringing on the trademark rights of the brand owner. It plays a key role in the practice of retail arbitrage, allowing sellers to purchase discounted items from retail stores and resell them on online marketplaces for a profit.
