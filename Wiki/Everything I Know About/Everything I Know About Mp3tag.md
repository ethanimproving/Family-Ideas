## Use Regular Expressions

Select all the files you wish to modify, right-click, and choose `Actions (Quick) > Replace with Regular Expression`.

Example:

```
Pattern: (\d\d)(\d\d)(\d\d)(.)
Replace: $1-$2-20$3 \U$4M -
```

`010514a - Love One Another` becomes `01-05-2014 AM - Love One Another`.

## Add Metadata

Plex will pickup metadata that is written to the properties of MP4 files, such as Title, Date, Comment, etc.

HOWEVER. The process of tagging MP4s can be [very slow if they exist on a NAS](https://community.mp3tag.de/t/an-observation-regarding-tag-values-and-performance-speeds/61562) or external drive. I moved them from the NAS to local drive and voil√†, it's as fast as mp3 tagging. So the difference is the NAS vs. local drive.

| -------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Filename - Tag |               | `%track% - %month%-%day%-%year% %time% - %title%`                                                                    |
| Tag - Tag      | Comment       | `Preached by Pastor Steven Anderson at Faithful Word Baptist Church on %month%/%day%/%year% for the %time% service.` |
| Tag - Tag      | Media created | `%month%/%day%/%year%` See [[Everything I Know About exiftool#Add "Media created" Tag\|exiftool]].                   |

## Add Spirit Sheets

Being able to mouseover the timeline is awesome. To do that, generate spirit sheets using [[Everything I Know About FFmpeg#Generate Sprite Sheet (Filmstrip/Montage) From Multiple MP4s|FFmpeg]].
