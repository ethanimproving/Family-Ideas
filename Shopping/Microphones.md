# Blue YetiA

Price: $109

The [Blue Yeti](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/streaming-gear/yeti-premium-usb-microphone.988-000103.html) was the first microphone I ever bought. I did a lot of research as a teenager, and with my limited budget, enough YouTubers suggested the Blue Yeti for personal projects that I thought it was be perfect for my dreams to record raps, partially inspired by artists like [MarsRaps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1a_SUJQAnpI) and [Chester See](https://youtu.be/J6mNmu1KHHA?si=9m08Jt6UIwy3FvNy&t=77). I eventually did record several [Bible Raps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkZF-Fp1iqk&list=PLd8VdbWP8YWvrwAVEA5AVyOa5VC_MEjlC) with it, but after awhile I had to stop chasing my creative desires to pursue a career.
