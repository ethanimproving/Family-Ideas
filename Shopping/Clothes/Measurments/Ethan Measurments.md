# Cut Resistence

Cut resistant gloves are often classified into different levels based on their ability to resist cuts and punctures. These levels provide a standardized way to compare the cut resistance of different gloves. The most commonly used cut resistance classification system is the ANSI/ISEA 105-2016 standard.

**The ANSI/ISEA 105-2016 standard defines nine levels of cut resistance**, ranging from A1 to A9, with A1 being the lowest and A9 being the highest level of cut resistance. The level is determined based on the glove's performance in standardized cut resistance tests.

Here is a general overview of the ANSI/ISEA cut resistance levels:

1. **A1 to A3**: These levels represent ==lower levels of cut resistance== suitable for light-duty tasks or minimal cut hazards.
	
1. **A4 to A6**: These levels offer ==moderate cut resistance== suitable for medium-duty tasks or situations with a moderate risk of cuts.
	
1. **A7 to A9**: These levels provide high to ==extreme cut resistance== suitable for heavy-duty tasks or environments with a high risk of cuts.

It's important to note that the specific cut resistance requirements can vary depending on the industry and application. Different countries or organizations may have their own standards for cut resistance levels as well.

When selecting cut resistant gloves, it's advisable to consider the specific task, the level of cut hazards involved, and any applicable safety regulations or standards to ensure the appropriate level of protection.
