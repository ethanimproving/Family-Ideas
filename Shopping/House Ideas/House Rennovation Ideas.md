> [!Bible] [1 Corinthians 2:9 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/1Corinthians+2:9?translation=kjv)
> 9. But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.

The bigger imagination we have, the bigger this promise will be to us. And the bigger all the promises of God are to us, the more faithfully we will live, and the more motivated we will be to seek and serve him.

> [!Bible] [Hebrews 11:6 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/hebrews+11:6?translation=kjv)
> 6. But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.

God intends for his rewards to motivate us. It isn't selfish to seek God being partly motivated by the rewards he has in store. Indeed, this is why he gives them. Part of living a life full of faith is not just believing in Jesus enough for salvation, but believe in all the promises of God. By Faith Abraham left his father and moved away, desiring the promise.

One of the deadliest mental problems in the world is simply lack of desire. Laziness another word for lack of desire. If you want it bad enough, you will wake up early, you will get our of bed, you will stay up late, and you will work hard. The reason anybody is lazy is because they don't know what they want. [^Mark Gorman] If you can prepare a vision in your mind of something you want, the most beautiful architecture you've ever seen, fountains everywhere, clean and modern floors made of crystal, and you cling to the promise that you haven't even imagined anything close to what God has in store for you when you love him, it will motivate you to love him more. Maybe you believe that makes your motivation impure, but the Bible says we have to be partly motivated by the rewards in order to please God. So if you have trouble being motivated, look at something you want. Create a vision. Imagine something beautiful. Craft a life exactly how you want it.

# Bedrooms

## Comfortable white/black bedroom ideas with frame on the wall, also black fabric bed frame, feat white bedding

My favorite part of this design is the glass walls with excellent daytime light and a beautiful view. The ==matts under the bed on a wooden floor== is also nice.

## Gray painted low profile bed, wooden materials with two cream leather egg chairs, ceiling design

Neat little cubby for desk-work, and a glass sliding door for outside access. The matt on a wooden floor is nice. The nightstand is also clean and modern.

### Purple and Orange is a win for girls

Notice the hideaway bed under the upper-bed. This allows for more shelving space up top, while still having floor space below during the day. Beds are designed to make you sleepy, so there is no need to be in one during the day when you are meant to be awake.

Space is also an important element and [Clever](https://www.clever.it/en/) has that idea in mind since 1993. Each of their pieces of furniture is made with the purpose of making to make clever use of space in small, medium and large bedrooms. The more free space, the more freedom your kid will have to play, right?

Purple cabinets provide a lot of storage space while still maintaining that modern look.

### Green and White Room

The bed under the cabinets for more space-efficient storage. Cabinets conceal the detailed mess of toys and other items, making the room look cleaner as a whole.

### Foldout bed

The larger bed also folds up, creating an office or study area with plenty of gathering room or even space for a teenage dance party.

![](http://cdn.home-designing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/modern-murphy-bed.jpeg)

Instead of folding down underneath the bed, this desk actually raises up and sits above the bed for additional storage and convenience.

### Another green room

When you are about to choose a wardrobe often we prefer the design and capacity. We must not forget, however, that a good wardrobe is a container that has to be equipped in the most correct way, to simplify the task of storing clothing in a practical and rational. It is the golden rule for the perfect wardrobe, like this: so minimal out how comfortable and spacious inside. This cabinet is functional to have all you need in the morning before heading out.
