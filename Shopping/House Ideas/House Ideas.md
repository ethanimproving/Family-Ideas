### Premier Pillowtop
  
Giving the Eurotop a run for first place in this collection, the Pillowtop has a medium-soft feel to it. Pillowtops in general run softer than Eurotops so that makes this mattress a much needed addition to the Premier collection. ([Golden Mattress](https://www.goldenmattressdallas.com/premier.html))

## Will the weight damage my door?

Filled with 12 pairs of shoes, the Shoe Rack is 18 pounds. A 24x80 Hollow core door weighs about [14 pounds](https://absupply.net/pdf/KV_Door-Weight-Table.pdf). 

![](https://i.imgur.com/sbTmi4V.png)

According to *The DIY Plan*, a set of 3 standard residential duty door hinges with steel pins can support 70 pounds with high frequency.

| Door Hinge Type                         | Medium Frequency | High Frequency    |
|-----------------------------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Residential duty interior hinge (2 set) | 90 pounds        | 45 pounds         |
| Residential duty interior hinge (3 set) | 120 pounds       | <mark class="hltr-yellow">70</mark> pounds        |
| Residential duty hinge                  | 400 pounds       | 200 pounds        |
| Commercial Duty Hinge                   | 600 pounds       | 400 pounds        |
| Heavy duty hinge                        | 1000 pounds      | 600 pounds        |
| Cabinet Doors                           |  ~ 80 pounds     | ~ 80 pounds total |


Thus even with 12 pounds of shoes added, standard hinges have a 174 pound clearance.

$$70lb - 12lb - 14lb = 44lb$$


According to *The Hinge Guys* there are [3 types of door hinges](https://www.select-hinges.com/blog/27-standard-or-heavy-duty-hinges) for exterior doors:

1. **Standard Duty** - For low- or medium-frequency doors <mark class="hltr-yellow">up to 200 lb</mark>. without frame or door reinforcement.
2. **Heavy Duty** - For high-frequency doors up to 200 lb. or medium-frequency doors up to 400 lb., both without frame or door reinforcement; or low-frequency doors up to 600 lb. with the use of Rivnuts in the frame and door.
3. **Heavy Duty (LL)** - For low-frequency doors up to 1,000 lb., including most lead-lined doors. (SELECT uses HD hinges with additional fastener holes.) Rivnuts are recommended in the frame and door on extremely tall, extremely heavy or wide doors. (Pyatte)

Thus even with 12 pounds of shoes added, standard hinges have a 174 pound clearance.

$$200lb - 12lb - 14lb = 174lb$$
