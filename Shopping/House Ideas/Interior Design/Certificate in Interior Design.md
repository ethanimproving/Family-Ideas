- Explain what a professional interior designer does
- Understand the divisions of the interior design profession
- Discuss the role of an interior designer as a professional

## What is an Interior Designer?

An interior designer is a person with the education and experience necessary to improve the function and aesthetic quality of an interior space. They work towards improving the quality of life, increasing productivity, and protecting the health, safety, and welfare of the people.

## Interior Design as a Profession

Interior design professionals provide owners of homes and businesses with functionally successful and aesthetically attractive interior spaces. They focus on how a space in an interior environment should look and function, considering the arrangements of interior walls, health and safety, furniture selection, and aesthetic embellishments.

## Divisions of the Profession

The interior design profession can be divided into two main branches:

### 1. Residential Design

Residential interior design is for private places such as homes. It may involve designing a whole residence or only a specific area within it. The functions involved in creating the specific area can vary.

### 2. Commercial Design

Commercial interior design includes various establishments such as hotels, banks, offices, retail stores, hospitals, factories, museums, beauty parlors, gyms, theatres, and more. The designer needs to consider not only the client but also the other people who will use the space, including customers, employees, and the public.

There are also sub-branches within the profession that designers can choose to specialize in, such as kitchen and bath design, windows and draperies, and lighting.

## Designer-Client Relationships

In the interior design field, there are different relationships that can exist between the designer and the client:

- Pure designer
- Agent
- Merchant
- Employee
- Contractor

## A Designer's Basic Considerations for Designing a Scheme

There are three basics on which the whole building of a well-planned room stands:

### 1. Function

The interior designer plans a room scheme to function at its best. This involves considering how the space can be divided into different zones, addressing wiring, lighting, ceiling, floor, walls, and windows, and identifying areas that can be improved.

### 2. Mood

Mood refers to the atmosphere or feeling a room creates. It involves the desired emotional response, whether it's relaxed, formal, stimulating, calming, cool, warm, or cozy. Factors that affect mood include lighting, color, and texture.

### 3. Style

Style is about creating a cohesive look for the room. It can be traditional, modern, American country, oriental, gothic, and more. The style chosen should align with the desired mood and functional requirements.

## Summary

In this unit, you have learned that interior design goes beyond enhancing the visual appeal of a space. You've explored the roles and responsibilities within the profession, including the differences between residential and commercial design. Additionally, you've gained insights into the components that contribute to the appeal and practicality of a space, as well as creating the right mood and style.

# Unit 2: Decorating Principles

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this unit, you will be able to:

- Understand the principles of interior design, such as unity, balance, proportion, scale, rhythm, and emphasis.
- Discover how successful interiors can be created by applying these principles.

## Interior Design Decorating Principles

Interior design is a science focused on understanding the basic design principles, including overarching ideas like balance and scale, to create balanced and harmonious spaces. Designers need to consider key areas, including human dimensions, scale and proportion, and ordering principles.

### Human Dimensions

Designers need to be familiar with **the amount of space required for specific activities** to create comfortable spaces for clients. **Scale** refers to the ==size of an object compared to others==, while **proportion** is the ==size of a part of an object compared to the rest==.

### Balance or Harmony

Achieving overall beauty in a design scheme is possible through balance. This balance is established through **colors, shapes, sizes, textures**, and more, as different elements create different degrees of interest.

### Contrast

Contrast can be introduced into interiors in various ways, such as contrasting forms, colors, textures, and light and shades. It adds **visual interest and diversity** to a space.

### Rhythm

Rhythm is the **repetition of elements in space and time**. It can be organized, unorganized, or transitional. Repetition involves using the same element multiple times, **progression** involves increasing or decreasing qualities, and **transition** creates a smooth flow between areas.

### Emphasis or Focal Point

Every room needs a focal point, **an area that draws attention** and encourages further exploration. It can be something obvious like a fireplace or an eye-catching display. The focal point should be dominant and interesting.

### Unity and Variety

Unity is the feeling that **things belong together**, and it's a hallmark of good design. Variety brings change. ==Too much unity can be boring, while too much variety can be overwhelming==.

## Practical Planning

### Purpose

Function and practicality are priorities when planning a space, although aesthetic and holistic aspects are also considered.

### Circulation

Circulation through a space is crucial, ensuring **comfortable and safe movement for staff and guests**. Traffic flow plans may be created to optimize movement.

### Storage

Storage planning is essential to **accommodate everything required with efficiency and easy access**.

### Safety

Safety is a planning priority, particularly for children and the elderly.

### Structural Considerations

Consulting with engineers or surveyors is important before making structural decisions.

## Summary

In this unit, you have learned that interior design is a science focused on understanding design principles. Balance holds the key to creating beautiful interior design schemes, and it can be achieved in various ways. Having a focal point in each room is crucial, and unity and variety play important roles. Additionally, practical planning factors such as purpose, circulation, storage, safety, and structural considerations contribute to successful interior design.

# Unit 3: Design Elements

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this unit, you will be able to:

- Understand space and its impact on orientation, circulation, interzoning, and fixture and furniture arrangements.
- Develop design programs and concepts that solve spatial problems in an interior.
- Explore different aspects of color schemes.

## Design Elements

### Space

- **Function**: Consider all the activities that take place in a room.
- **Changing room use**: Often beneficial to adapt the use of a room.
- **Planning sequence**: Examination and potential alteration of structure, furniture arrangement, lighting, and color scheme.

### Floor Plans

**Visualizing space**: When assessing space, try to **imagine the walls are invisible and that each room flows into the next**. This can reveal new possibilities. The floor plan will also help while deciding the furniture and decoration. If a room is too small, working with limited space can be a challenge. However, taking advantage of some small space tips can make a big difference in how a room is perceived.

**Furniture and decoration**: Floor plan aids in deciding furniture placement and decorative elements.
    
- Dealing with limited space:
    - **Expand the view**: Remove unnecessary walls to create a more open space.
    - **Coordinate color scheme**: Visually connected rooms feel larger.
    - **Unify the floor**: Use the same flooring style for adjoining rooms.
    - **Install recessed lighting**: ==Creates a greater sense of height==.
    - **Maximize scale**: Consider smaller furniture options for a small room.
    - **Utilize multi-functional furniture**: Save space with versatile pieces.
    - **Get creative**: Use unique areas for built-in cabinets or display areas.
    - **Use mirrors and glass**: Create a sense of space and reflection.

- Dealing with a large space:
    - **Select large-scale furniture**: Larger items carry more visual weight.
    - **Create social islands**: Multiple seating areas in large rooms.
    - **Warm the walls**: Hues on the warmer side of the color wheel seem to move forward and visually envelope a space to create a greater sense of intimacy.
    - **Bring the ceiling down**: Paint the ceiling in a darker tone.
    - **Introduce texture**: Mix tactile qualities for visual interest.

### The Color Wheel

The color wheel is the **representative of the way we perceive light**. It is a tool to demonstrate relationships between colors. Understanding its principles gives a fundamental knowledge for designing beautiful color schemes.

- **Primary** colors: Red, blue, and yellow.
- **Secondary** colors: Colors created by ==mixing primary colors==.
- **Tertiary** colors: Created by ==combining primary and secondary colors==.

### Choosing a Color Scheme

- Consider the room's function, **time spent in the room**, orientation, size adjustment, **desired mood**, usage time, and existing possessions.
- **Color psychology**: Warm colors (red, orange, yellow) and cool colors (purple, blue, green) evoke different feelings.

### Different Types of Patterns

- **Geometric patterns**: Examples include stripes, decorative and can deceive the eye.
- **Floral patterns**: Focuses on various types of flowers.
- **Motif patterns**: Repeated images that can be representational or abstract.
- **Pictorial patterns**: Scenic in nature, similar to a motif pattern.

The only patterns I like are geometric.

### Taking Care

- Avoid strong patterns in areas where they may cause eye strain, such as kitchen work surfaces.

## Summary

By completing this unit, you have learned:

- The importance of considering the function of a space before designing or decorating it.
- Techniques to make a small space appear larger.
- How to choose appropriate colors and color schemes.
- Different types of patterns and their applications.
- Considerations for avoiding eye strain caused by strong patterns.

# Unit 4: Room Elements

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this unit, you will be able to:

- Discuss different aspects of lighting schemes
- Explore various treatments for walls and ceilings
- Describe the need for suitable flooring for the room

## Lighting

When planning a home, rooms should be allocated according to the amount of natural light they receive, as well as for other practical reasons. **Light has a major impact on our enjoyment of a room**. Good lighting can alter the apparent size of a room, ==enhance the good features, and diminish the ugly ones==.

- **Natural Light**: Daylight alters in intensity from season to season and even from hour to hour. Consider how light changes during the day and how it falls in different areas of the room. Dark corners may need a subtle boost of artificial light.
- **Types of Light**:
    - **Ambient Lighting**: The ==overall lighting== of a room, from the ==sun's rays== streaming through the window to an ==overhead fixture== providing its primary glow.
    - **Task Lighting**: Used to ==illuminate a specific area== for a more practical reason, such as reading.
    - **Accent Lighting**: Provides a way to ==focus attention on architectural or decorative aspects== of a room.
- **Selecting the Right Fittings**: The choice of light fittings depends upon the room, personal taste, style, color, and the amount of light required. Examples of light fittings include **pendant lights**, **chandeliers**, **task lamps**, **wall lights**, **floor or table lamps**, **downlighters**, **wall washers**, and **spotlights**.
- **Directing Light**:
    - Up Light: Projects light up a wall or towards the ceiling, giving the illusion of more space.
    - Down Light: Projects light towards the lower part of the room.
    - Diffused Light: Dispersed throughout the room, making it work for ambient light.
    - Multi-directional Light: Directed in many directions for a combination of lighting.

## Walls and Ceilings

### Walls

When choosing a wall covering, decide whether you want the walls to recede into the background or have more impact in the scheme. Options for wall decoration include paint, plain plaster, paper, fabric, mirrors, or paneling.

### Decorative Ceilings

Giving the ceilings a special treatment can make rooms more interesting and distinguished. Options include moldings or cornices, special paint treatments, using fabric for a tinted effect, or pasting up skirting sealing paper.

### Paints

There are different types of paints available for different purposes:

- **Non-drip Paints**: Do not need thinning or stirring.
- **Acrylic Paints**: Cover well and dry quickly with less smell than oil-based paints.
- **Epoxy Enamels**: Provide a hard gloss finish and can be used on various surfaces.
- **Textured Enamels**: Useful for painting wood paneling and furniture.
- **Distemper or Whitewash**: Consists of a chalk called whiting dissolved in water and animal glue, with added pigments.
- **Colour Washes**: Applied with a sponge or decorator's brush over a base coat to achieve an attractive finish.

## Flooring

Choosing the right floor for a room involves considering color, pattern, and scale. The size of a pattern and the scale of the flooring should be consistent with the overall design statement.

- **Modern Looks**: Materials appropriate for sleek, luxurious modernism include polished stone, rubber, neutral wall-to-wall carpeting, sophisticated vinyl, and cork flooring.
- **Classic Looks**: Stone and wood flooring tiles are modern shortcuts to classical interior design.
- **Country Look**: Mexican tile or honed stone are important for establishing a well-loved rural design.

## Furniture 

The choice of furniture plays a vital role in the success of a room. No other element is as important in determining how well a scheme works both practically and aesthetically. The layout of furniture in a room determines its ambiance, whether it feels formal or relaxed, cozy or spacious. Sometimes, a single item can be used as a focal point to alter the perception of a space.

### Importance of Proper Furniture Arrangement

For a room to function well, it needs to be arranged properly. If the furnishings are not appropriate, if there is no real focal point, if people do not feel comfortable, or if there is no designated space for activities like reading or placing a glass or coffee cup, the room fails to function effectively.

### Furniture Arrangement Checklists

To ensure proper furniture placement, you can use a checklist that considers the following factors:

- **Practicality**: Will it work well?
- **Aesthetics**: Will it look good?
- **Organization of space**: Is there going to be enough space around the individual furniture items?
- **Traffic planning**: Can people move around easily?
- **Scale and balance**: Will the furniture look well balanced without any individual item dominating?
- **Environmental aspects**: Will furniture be exposed to excessive sun, humidity, heat, cold, or dryness?
- **Ease of use**: Will people be able to listen to music and watch television easily? Is there a good focal point?

### Tips on Arranging Furniture

Some tips for arranging furniture include choosing furnishings with colors that closely match their intended background to create a less cluttered appearance. If you want furniture to stand out, you can opt for contrasting colors. It's also important to consider the size and cushions of sofas, leaving enough space around dining tables for movement, and incorporating stools and poufs for occasional sitting and storage.

When designing wardrobes, ensure sufficient depth for coat hangers. Arrange furnishings in a way that greets people with a pleasant view upon entering the room. In kitchens and bathrooms, use recessed plinths for units to allow standing close to the work surface or basin.
