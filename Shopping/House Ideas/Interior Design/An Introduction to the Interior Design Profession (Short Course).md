# Interior Design as a Profession

We spend over 90 percent of our day in interior spaces. Despite this, most of us take interiors for granted. We seldom notice the furniture, colors, textures, and other elements around us. But sometimes, the design of an interior space does catch our attention; maybe it is the rich paneling of an expensive restaurant, the soothing background of a religious place, or the charms of a show home staged by a professional interior designer.

Interior design professionals provide the owners of homes and businesses with functionally practical and aesthetically attractive interior spaces. An interior designer, whether working for domestic or commercial clients, benefits society by focusing on how an interior environment should look and function. By planning the arrangements of interior walls, considering how the design affects health and safety, selecting appropriate furniture, choosing aesthetic embellishments, and so on, the designer brings life to an interior space. As a result, the client's functional and aesthetic vision becomes a reality.

The interior design profession is about much more than selecting colors and fabrics and rearranging furniture. The professional interior designer must consider building and safety codes, understand environmental issues, and consider the basic construction and mechanical systems of buildings.

## The Development of Interior Design as a Profession

Throughout history, there have always been people who take an interest in the quality of interior spaces. At various times, architects, artists, craftsmen, and merchants have designed and furnished interiors. Traditionally, an architect developed the structure of a building, and the interior was usually designed by artisans and craftsmen. By the beginning of the twentieth century, department stores began promoting accessories and furnishings to the everyday consumer, which greatly helped establish design trends and increased the demand for interior design services. By the 1940s, interior design was developed as a separate profession, targeting the improvement of interior spaces in the commercial sector.

Interior designers often specialize in specific areas such as residential or non-residential interior design. Residential interior design focuses on private places, encompassing whole residences or specific rooms within them. It involves planning, designing, executing, and furnishing private houses or apartments, as well as providing consultations and advice on various aspects of residential interior design. On the other hand, non-residential interior design covers a wide range of spaces such as hotels, banks, offices, retail establishments, hospitals, factories, museums, beauty parlors, gyms, and theaters. This specialization requires considering not only non-residential interior design covers a wide range of spaces such as hotels, banks, offices, retail establishments, hospitals, factories, museums, beauty parlors, gyms, and theaters. This specialization requires considering not only aesthetics but also functionality, safety regulations, and specific needs of the occupants.

Over time, interior design has evolved to incorporate various specializations based on specific types of projects or areas of expertise. Some common specializations within the field of interior design include:

1. **Commercial Interior Design**: This specialization focuses on designing interior spaces for commercial purposes such as offices, retail stores, restaurants, and hospitality establishments. Commercial interior designers work closely with clients to create functional and visually appealing spaces that align with the brand image and cater to the needs of employees and customers.
    
2. **Healthcare Interior Design**: Healthcare facilities require specialized design considerations to ensure the well-being of patients, staff, and visitors. Healthcare interior designers create environments that are hygienic, comfortable, and conducive to healing. They incorporate elements like proper lighting, durable materials, infection control measures, and ergonomic furniture to enhance the healthcare experience.
    
3. **Hospitality Interior Design**: This specialization revolves around designing interior spaces for hotels, resorts, restaurants, and other hospitality venues. Hospitality interior designers aim to create inviting, luxurious, and memorable environments that meet the unique requirements of each establishment. They focus on creating functional layouts, selecting appropriate furnishings, and incorporating elements that enhance the guest experience.
    
4. **Sustainable Interior Design**: With growing environmental awareness, sustainable interior design has gained prominence. Sustainable designers prioritize eco-friendly materials, energy-efficient systems, and sustainable practices to minimize the environmental impact of interior spaces. They aim to create healthier indoor environments while promoting sustainability and reducing carbon footprints.
    
5. **Residential Interior Design**: Residential interior designers work on creating personalized and functional living spaces for individual homeowners. They consider the **lifestyle, preferences, and needs of the occupants** to design interiors that reflect their personality and provide comfort. Residential designers may work on entire homes or focus on specific rooms such as kitchens, bathrooms, or living areas.
    
6. **Exhibition and Set Design**: This specialization involves designing temporary or permanent exhibits for museums, galleries, trade shows, and other public spaces. Exhibition and set designers combine artistic creativity with functional design to create visually captivating and interactive environments that engage viewers and convey a specific message or theme.
    

These are just a few examples of the specializations within the interior design profession. Depending on their interests and expertise, professionals may choose to focus on one or multiple areas of specialization throughout their career.

Interior design as a profession continues to evolve and adapt to **changing trends**, **technologies**, and **societal needs**. With a blend of creativity, technical knowledge, and client-centered approach, interior designers play a crucial role in shaping the functionality, aesthetics, and ambiance of interior spaces in various sectors.

## A Designer's Basic Considerations for Design a Scheme

There are three basic considerations on which the entire design of a well-planned room is based, which are:

- Function
- Mood
- Style

### Function

The interior designer, when planning a room scheme, wants it to function at its best. This involves deciding how the space can be apportioned into different zones, what should be done about the **wiring**, **lighting**, **ceiling**, **floor**, **walls**, and **windows**, what can be improved and so on. A complete analysis of this gives them a framework on which they can build whatever mood or style is required.

In order to develop a clear idea about the function of a room, a designer will have to know the purpose for which the room will be used and who it is being planned for. They will have to ascertain what it is needed for, how it will be used, and who will use it. The function of a room is all about practicality, comfort, and the conveniences required in the room. Good interior design is as much about practicality, comfort, and detailing as it is about mood and style. However beautiful the window treatments, however original the color schemes, however splendid the furnishings, no one will appreciate it unless the room is comfortable overall and functions as it should.

### Mood

When people think about **the effect they want to create in their homes**, what they are often considering is mood or atmosphere. For example, whether a room is to have a **relaxed or formal** vibe, be **stimulating or calming**, cool and **airy or warm and cozy**. Mood relates to ==how you feel when you are in the room==. If a space has several functions - such as a living room which includes a play area or a home office that converts to a guest bedroom - it may be necessary to alter the mood according to who is using the room and the time of the day.

**Light and color have a strong impact on mood**. ==Subdued lights are relaxing, while bright lights are stimulating==. If you use very bright lights in a room which is meant for relaxing, it will not fulfill the requirements of the mood that is actually required. Similarly, soft creams and quiet taupe colors send out very different signals than hot reds and rich greens. Texture is also important. A room decorated with simple cottons and linens is very different in character from one dominated by leathers and velvets. The same is true of floor coverings; a wooden floor provides a different atmosphere than a thick wool carpet. Mood depends on the function of the room and the climate in which someone wants to live.

### Style

Style is mainly about putting a look together, whereas mood relates to how you want to feel when in the room. Style can be **traditional, modern, American country, oriental, Gothic**, etc.

Inspiration for interiors can come from almost anything. Travel, for example, has a strong influence today, as do references from museums and art galleries. Interior design magazines and books on related subjects all offer a wealth of inspiration. Inspiration can come from a single object like an oriental carpet, or a painting can suggest a color scheme for an entire room. If two people have to share a room and both have different tastes - traditional versus modern, for example - you can start by creating a neutral backdrop and can then add elements that will appeal to both parties.

When choosing a decorative style for a room, also consider the architectural style of the room. Look at features like cornices, skirting boards, fireplaces, dados, doors, and windows, and then decide if all these features are compatible with the style you want to create.
