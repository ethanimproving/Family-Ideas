The [Strauss–Howe Generational Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strauss%E2%80%93Howe_generational_theory), also known as the Fourth Turning theory, is a sociological theory about the recurring cycles of generations in American history. Developed by William Strauss and Neil Howe, the theory suggests that history unfolds in a series of recurring generational cycles, each lasting about 80-100 years and composed of four generational archetypes that repeat sequentially. Each cycle, or "saeculum," is characterized by four turnings, each lasting around 20-25 years. The theory aims to provide a framework for understanding the interplay between generational identities and historical events.

Here are the key components of the theory:

### Generational Archetypes

1. **Prophet (Idealist) Generation**: Born during a time of high societal order and stability. They come of age during a spiritual awakening and are typically characterized by their values-driven leadership. Examples include the Baby Boomers (born 1946-1964).
    
2. **Nomad (Reactive) Generation**: Born during an awakening period, a time of social and spiritual upheaval. They grow up as under-protected children during an unraveling and come of age as pragmatic, tough adults. Examples include Generation X (born 1965-1980).
    
3. **Hero (Civic) Generation**: Born after an awakening, during a time of individualism and fragmentation. They grow up as protected children during a crisis and come of age as collective, institution-building young adults. Examples include the Millennials (born 1981-1996).
    
4. **Artist (Adaptive) Generation**: Born during a crisis, a time of societal upheaval and reconstruction. They grow up as over-protected children and come of age as conformist, process-oriented adults. Examples include the Silent Generation (born 1925-1945).
    

### The Four Turnings

1. **The High**: A period of strong institutions and weak individualism. Society is cohesive and confident, often following the resolution of a major crisis. Example: Post-World War II boom (1946-1964).
    
2. **The Awakening**: A period of spiritual upheaval and challenge to the established social order. Institutions are attacked in the name of personal and spiritual autonomy. Example: The Consciousness Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s.
    
3. **The Unraveling**: A period of weakening institutions and growing individualism. Society becomes fragmented and troubled, with the social order decaying. Example: The Culture Wars and the 1980s-1990s.
    
4. **The Crisis**: A period of destruction and renewal, where society faces existential threats. Institutions are rebuilt, and a new societal order emerges. Example: The Great Depression and World War II, and potentially the period beginning with the 2008 financial crisis.
    

### Implications and Criticisms

The theory suggests that each generation plays a distinct role in shaping and reacting to historical events, and that these generational types repeat in a predictable pattern. According to Strauss and Howe, understanding these cycles can help forecast future societal trends and crises.

However, the theory has been criticized for being overly deterministic and for fitting historical events into a rigid framework. Critics argue that the theory does not account for the complex, non-linear nature of history and societal change.

Despite criticisms, the Strauss–Howe Generational Theory has been influential in popular culture and among some policymakers and analysts who seek to understand the interplay between generational dynamics and historical events.
