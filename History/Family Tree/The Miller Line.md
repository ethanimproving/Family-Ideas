[Gruffydd ap Llywelyn](https://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/details/KN42-SDM)

Gruffydd ap Llywelyn (c. 1196 – 1 March 1244) was the Welsh first-born son of Llywelyn the Great ("Llywelyn Fawr"). His mother Tangwystl probably died in childbirth.

As a boy, Gruffydd was one of the hostages taken by King John of England as a pledge for his father's continued good faith. A clause in Magna Carta (1215) compelled his release. On his father's death in 1240, under Welsh law, he would have been entitled to consideration as his father's successor. Llywelyn however had excluded him from the succession and had declared Dafydd, his son by his wife Joan, to be heir to the kingdom. Llywelyn went to great lengths to strengthen Dafydd's position, probably aware that there would be considerable Welsh support for Gruffydd against the half-English Dafydd.

Gruffydd was given lands in Ardudwy and Merioneth by his father, though in 1221 he was removed for maladministration of those lands. In 1223 he commanded a force of his father's army, against William Marshal. His father then imprisoned him between 1228 and 1234. On his release he was again given lands, this time controlling much of the commotes of Llŷn, Ceri, Cyfeiliog, Mawddwy, Mochnant and Caereinion.

Gruffydd was held a prisoner by his brother Dafydd when the latter took over Gwynedd. Following a successful invasion of the Welsh borders by King Henry III of England in 1241, Dafydd was obliged to hand over Gruffydd into the king's custody, he was then taken to London and imprisoned in the Tower of London. Gruffydd's wife, Senana (possibly a daughter of Caradoc ap Thomas of Anglesey), agreed to pay Henry 600 marks for the release of her husband and their eldest son, Owain, and to hand over her two youngest sons, Dafydd and Rhodri, to the king as hostages to ensure that she kept her part of the bargain. Henry did not keep his part however, and kept Gruffydd and his son imprisoned as "guests" because this continued to give him the possibility of using Gruffydd as a weapon against his brother.

However, Gruffydd died while attempting to escape from the Tower in 1244. He is said to have used an improvised rope made from sheets and cloths to lower himself from his window, but as he was a heavy man, the rope broke and he fell to his death.

In 1248, the abbots of Strata Florida and Aberconwy arranged for the return of his body to Wales, where he was buried at Aberconwy with his father.

After his death Gruffydd's four sons—Owain, Llywelyn, Dafydd and Rhodri—would come into their own, and after much fraternal discord, Llywelyn ended up ruling most of Wales. He also had three daughters, Gwladus, Catherine and Margred.

According to several non-contemporary Welsh genealogical tracts, the mother of Llywelyn was Rhanullt, an otherwise unknown daughter of Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson, King of the Isles. If correct, these sources could indicate that Gruffydd married a daughter of Rǫgnvaldr in about 1220. Contemporary sources, however, show that Llywelyn's mother was Senana, an undoubted wife of Gruffydd.

Issue

Gruffudd appears to have had four sons and three daughters by two women. Sources are not in agreement about the numbers or mothers of the children.

Cawley identifies only one wife, Senana and states that with Gruffydd she had five children -- Owain, Llywelyn, Dafydd, Rhodri, and Gladys. Cawley does not include Catrin or Margred among Gruffydd's children. 
The Dictionary of Welsh Biography identifies no mother of the children, but names the same five children as Cawley, excluding Catrin and Margred. 
Carl Boyer and Stewart Baldwin both base their lists of children on Bartrum. Carl Boyer presents three wives in order -- first, Senena, second Rhannullt, and third Catrin. This cannot be correct because Senena was the wife with visiting privileges to Gruffudd at the Tower of London when he attempted to escape. Following Bartrum, Boyer and Baldwin state that Owain, Llywelyn and Dafydd were the children of Senena, as listed by Bartrum; another Dafydd --Dafydd Felyn -- and Rhodri, are listed by Bartrum as mother not known; and daughters Caitrin and Gwladus are by Rhannult. 
Baldwin notes that in Bartrum's Welsh Genealogies [BWG], Senena is given as the mother of three of his children (Owain Goch, Llywelyn, and Dafydd), Rhanullt is given as the mother of two daughters (Catrin and Gwladus, of whom the latter's husband is given as Rhys Ieuanc ap Rhys Mechyll), and a third wife (Catrin daughter of Cynchwr of Ireland [whoever he was]) is not listed as the mother of any of his children. Two sons, Rhodri and an uncertain second Dafydd, are listed with unknown mothers. 
Wikipedia identifies the same four sons: Owain, Llywelyn, Dafydd and Rhodri as well as three daughters, Gwladus, Catherine and Margred, but not the second Dafydd shown by Bartrum, Boyer and Baldwin. 
Attempting to make the best sense of the sources, the following list of children can be produced:

Catrin, born, say, 1217 to Gruffudd and Rhannult 
Gwladus, born, say, 1219 to Gruffudd and Rhannult
Owain, born, say, 1223 to Gruffudd and Senena
Llywelyn, born, say, 1225 to Gruffudd and Senena
Dafydd Felyn, born, say, 1227, to Gruffudd and Senena, perhaps died early.
Margred, born, say, 1229 to Gruffudd and Senena
Dafydd, born, say, 1232 to Gruffudd and Senena
Rhodri, born, say, 1235, to Gruffudd and Senena
