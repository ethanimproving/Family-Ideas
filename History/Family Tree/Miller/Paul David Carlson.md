On my Mother's side:
Grandpa was Half Swedish (Father's side), half Danish (Mother's side). Grandma Lydia was 100% German.

On my Father's side:
Grandma Corrine was 1/2 Austrian (Brotz), 1/8 French and 3/8 German. Grandpa Eugene was 1/2 German (Mother's side), 1/4 Scottish, and 1/4 Irish. Also a mix of Welsh, English, but so miniscule it's not worth mentioning.
