Assigning precise percentage estimates to the likelihood of David Anderson Miller (1765) being Methodist versus Presbyterian is challenging due to the limited information available and the complexity of historical factors. However, we can provide rough estimates based on the factors discussed. Here's an attempt:

### Rough Percentage Estimates:

- **Presbyterianism**: 60%
- **Methodism**: 40%

### Rationale:

- **Presbyterianism (60%)**:
    - David Anderson Miller's Scottish ancestry suggests a strong cultural and familial connection to Presbyterianism.
    - Presbyterianism was prevalent among Scottish immigrants, and communities often maintained their religious traditions.
    - Scottish Presbyterian churches were established early in regions like Ohio and Kentucky, providing a familiar religious environment for settlers.

- **Methodism (40%)**:
    - Methodism experienced significant growth during the Second Great Awakening, particularly in frontier areas like Ohio and Kentucky.
    - Methodist circuit riders played a crucial role in spreading Methodism to rural and frontier communities where formal church structures were limited.
    - The accessibility and evangelical fervor of Methodism may have appealed to settlers in areas with limited religious infrastructure.

### Conclusion:

While Presbyterianism appears somewhat more likely due to David Anderson Miller's Scottish heritage, Methodism also had a significant presence in the frontier regions where he lived. Therefore, we estimate that there's a slightly higher probability (60%) of him being Presbyterian, but Methodism remains a plausible alternative (40%) given the historical context. These estimates are subjective and based on available information, and actual probabilities may vary.
