Paul Carlson was a great man of God. At his funeral people recognized him for his big hands, signifying his servant attitude in life. He was always fixing things, making things, and serving others.

I was inspired by the tear-filled stories spoken when he died. 1,000 people visited his funeral, the largest funeral I've ever been too. Even while I was out knocking doors one time, a man told me he was from Wycliff, and I asked if he knew my grandfather. After telling him the name, "Paul Carlson," the man said, "He was a tall man." That's how far reaching my grandfather was.

My mother would tell me how he was always sure to lead a family devotion every night. And when she would come home from school as a little girl, she would regularly find him sitting in his chair reading his Bible.

He needed a pillow to sit on because a woman at his boarding school beat him very hard one time. His seat was sensitive ever since.

My [[August Wieboldt|Great Grandfather August]] did not want Lydia to marry him because of his allergies. He recognized that my Grandfather had various health problems and didn't want that in his descendants gene pool. Alas, more important than the unhealthy genes we inherited was the spiritual inheritance he left us.

I've always imagined molding my life after these elements of his life:
1. Daily family devotions / spiritual leadership in the family.
2. Hospitality. Inviting those in need into my home and serving them as Christ commanded.

The one wonder I had about him was this. My mom said he was very bothered on his death bed, asking himself, "Is there anyone I've forgotten to forgive?"

> 15. But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.
