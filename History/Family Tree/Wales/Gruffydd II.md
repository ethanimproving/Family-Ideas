# Gruffydd ap Llywelyn: The Unfortunate Heir

## Chapter One: The Shadow of a Legacy

In the rugged hills of medieval Wales, a tale of ambition, betrayal, and tragedy unfolds. Born to the illustrious Llywelyn the Great, Gruffydd ap Llywelyn was destined for greatness, yet his path was marred by strife and sorrow from the very beginning.

As a boy, Gruffydd found himself thrust into the treacherous world of politics and power. Taken as a hostage by King John of England, he became a pawn in his father's game of diplomacy, a bargaining chip in the struggle for Welsh independence. Despite the hardships of his captivity, Gruffydd remained resilient, his spirit unbroken by the chains of his captivity.

But as he reached adulthood, Gruffydd's dreams of inheriting his father's kingdom were shattered by a cruel twist of fate. Llywelyn, in a bid to secure the succession for his half-English son Dafydd, cast Gruffydd aside, denying him his birthright and plunging him into despair. Forced to watch from the shadows as his brother ascended to the throne, Gruffydd's resentment simmered beneath the surface, fueling a bitter rivalry that would define their relationship for years to come.

## Chapter Two: The Trials of Leadership

Exiled from his father's court, Gruffydd sought solace in the wilds of Ardudwy and Merioneth, where he endeavored to carve out a domain of his own. But his ambitions were thwarted by accusations of maladministration, leading to his removal from power and a period of exile from his homeland.

Undeterred by these setbacks, Gruffydd continued to fight for his place in the world, commanding his father's army in battles against William Marshal and struggling to assert his authority in the face of adversity. Yet his efforts were met with resistance at every turn, and in a cruel twist of fate, he found himself imprisoned once more, this time by his own father, who saw him as a threat to his chosen heir.

## Chapter Three: A Prisoner's Fate

Trapped within the walls of the Tower of London, Gruffydd languished in captivity, his hopes of freedom dwindling with each passing day. His beloved wife Senana, a beacon of strength and resilience in his darkest hour, negotiated tirelessly for his release, only to be betrayed by the very man she sought to appease.

In a desperate bid for freedom, Gruffydd attempted to escape his prison, but fate had other plans. As he lowered himself from his window on an improvised rope made with sheets, tragedy struck, and he plummeted to his death below. His life cut short by the cruelty of fate, Gruffydd's legacy lived on in the hearts of his sons, who would one day rise to claim their rightful place as rulers of Wales.

## Epilogue: A Legacy Remembered

Though Gruffydd's life was marked by hardship and sorrow, his memory endured as a testament to the resilience of the Welsh spirit. Through the trials and tribulations of his tumultuous reign, he remained steadfast in his commitment to his people, his legacy a reminder of the sacrifices made in the pursuit of freedom and honor. And though he may have been denied his rightful place in history, Gruffydd's name would live on in the annals of Welsh lore, a symbol of courage and determination for generations to come.

# Biography

## Family Search

[Gruffydd ap Llywelyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gruffudd_ap_Llywelyn_ap_Iorwerth) (c. 1196 – 1 March 1244) was the Welsh first-born son of Llywelyn the Great ("Llywelyn Fawr"). His mother Tangwystl probably died in childbirth.

### Hostage to King John of England

As a boy, ==Gruffydd was one of the hostages taken by King John of England as a pledge for his father's continued good faith==. A clause in Magna Carta (1215) compelled his release. On his father's death in 1240, under Welsh law, he would have been entitled to consideration as his father's successor. ==Llywelyn however had excluded him from the succession and had declared Dafydd, his son by his wife Joan, to be heir to the kingdom==. Llywelyn went to great lengths to strengthen Dafydd's position, probably aware that there would be considerable Welsh support for Gruffydd against the half-English Dafydd.

Gruffydd was given lands in Ardudwy and Merioneth by his father, though in 1221 he was removed for maladministration of those lands. In 1223 he commanded a force of his father's army, against William Marshal. His father then imprisoned him between 1228 and 1234. On his release he was again given lands, this time controlling much of the commotes of Llŷn, Ceri, Cyfeiliog, Mawddwy, Mochnant and Caereinion.

### Prisoner to His Half-English Brother

Gruffydd was held a prisoner by his brother Dafydd when the latter took over Gwynedd. Following a successful invasion of the Welsh borders by **King Henry III of England** in 1241, ==Dafydd was obliged to hand over Gruffydd into the king's custody==, he was then taken to London and ==imprisoned in the Tower of London==. Gruffydd's wife, Senana (possibly a daughter of Caradoc ap Thomas of Anglesey), agreed to ==pay Henry 600 marks for the release of her husband and their eldest son, Owain==, and to hand over her two youngest sons, **Dafydd** and Rhodri, to the king as hostages to ensure that she kept her part of the bargain. Henry did not keep his part however, and kept Gruffydd and his son imprisoned as "guests" because this continued to give him the possibility of using Gruffydd as a weapon against his brother.

### Death

However, Gruffydd ==died while attempting to escape from the Tower== in 1244. He is said to have used an improvised rope made from sheets and cloths to lower himself from his window, but ==as he was a heavy man, the rope broke and he fell to his death==.

In 1248, the abbots of Strata Florida and Aberconwy arranged for the return of his body to Wales, where he was buried at Aberconwy with his father.

### Succession

After his death Gruffydd's four sons—Owain, Llywelyn, Dafydd and Rhodri—would come into their own, and after much fraternal discord, Llywelyn ended up ruling most of Wales. He also had three daughters, Gwladus, Catherine and Margred.

According to several non-contemporary Welsh genealogical tracts, the mother of Llywelyn was Rhanullt, an otherwise unknown daughter of Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson, King of the Isles. If correct, these sources could indicate that Gruffydd married a daughter of Rǫgnvaldr in about 1220. Contemporary sources, however, show that Llywelyn's mother was Senana, an undoubted wife of Gruffydd.

### Issue

Gruffudd appears to have had four sons and three daughters by two women. Sources are not in agreement about the numbers or mothers of the children.

Cawley identifies only one wife, Senana and states that with Gruffydd she had five children -- Owain, Llywelyn, Dafydd, Rhodri, and Gladys. Cawley does not include Catrin or Margred among Gruffydd's children. 
The Dictionary of Welsh Biography identifies no mother of the children, but names the same five children as Cawley, excluding Catrin and Margred. 

Carl Boyer and Stewart Baldwin both base their lists of children on Bartrum. Carl Boyer presents three wives in order -- first, Senena, second Rhannullt, and third Catrin. This cannot be correct because Senena was the wife with visiting privileges to Gruffudd at the Tower of London when he attempted to escape. Following Bartrum, Boyer and Baldwin state that Owain, Llywelyn and Dafydd were the children of Senena, as listed by Bartrum; another Dafydd --Dafydd Felyn -- and Rhodri, are listed by Bartrum as mother not known; and daughters Caitrin and Gwladus are by Rhannult. 

Baldwin notes that in Bartrum's Welsh Genealogies [BWG], Senena is given as the mother of three of his children (Owain Goch, Llywelyn, and Dafydd), Rhanullt is given as the mother of two daughters (Catrin and Gwladus, of whom the latter's husband is given as Rhys Ieuanc ap Rhys Mechyll), and a third wife (Catrin daughter of Cynchwr of Ireland [whoever he was]) is not listed as the mother of any of his children. Two sons, Rhodri and an uncertain second Dafydd, are listed with unknown mothers. 

Wikipedia identifies the same four sons: Owain, Llywelyn, Dafydd and Rhodri as well as three daughters, Gwladus, Catherine and Margred, but not the second Dafydd shown by Bartrum, Boyer and Baldwin. 
Attempting to make the best sense of the sources, the following list of children can be produced:

Catrin, born, say, 1217 to Gruffudd and Rhannult 
Gwladus, born, say, 1219 to Gruffudd and Rhannult
Owain, born, say, 1223 to Gruffudd and Senena
Llywelyn, born, say, 1225 to Gruffudd and Senena
Dafydd Felyn, born, say, 1227, to Gruffudd and Senena, perhaps died early.
Margred, born, say, 1229 to Gruffudd and Senena
Dafydd, born, say, 1232 to Gruffudd and Senena
Rhodri, born, say, 1235, to Gruffudd and Senena

## ChatGPT

Gruffydd ap Llywelyn (c. 1196 – 1 March 1244) was a Welsh prince who played a significant role in the politics of Wales during the 13th century. He was the son of Llywelyn the Great, the Prince of Gwynedd, and Joan, Lady of Wales, who was also known as Joanna. Gruffydd was a member of the House of Aberffraw, one of the principal royal families of Wales.

Gruffydd ap Llywelyn faced a tumultuous political landscape during his lifetime. He was involved in numerous conflicts and alliances, often seeking to expand his influence and territory in Wales. He inherited portions of his father's realm upon Llywelyn the Great's death in 1240, but his reign was marked by internal disputes and external pressures, particularly from the English monarchy.

Gruffydd's attempts to assert his authority and expand his territories often brought him into conflict with both his fellow Welsh princes and the English crown. He allied with other Welsh rulers at times but also faced opposition and betrayal from within his own family and court.

Gruffydd's reign was relatively short, and he faced challenges throughout, struggling to maintain stability and unity in Wales amidst external threats and internal strife. He died on 1 March 1244, leaving behind a complicated legacy as a Welsh prince who sought to navigate the complex political realities of his time.

### Death

Gruffydd ap Llywelyn's exact cause of death is not definitively recorded in historical sources. However, it is believed that he died during a skirmish or battle. The circumstances surrounding his death remain somewhat unclear, as medieval records often lack detailed accounts of individual events, especially those involving Welsh princes during this period of history.

It's worth noting that the political landscape in Wales during Gruffydd's lifetime was characterized by frequent conflict, both among Welsh rulers themselves and with the English monarchy. These conflicts often resulted in skirmishes, battles, and acts of violence. Gruffydd's death may have occurred in one such confrontation, but the specific details are not well-documented.
