# The Lion of Gwynedd

In the rugged hills of ancient Wales, where misty valleys whispered secrets of old, there stood a kingdom that bore the weight of history upon its shoulders. Gwynedd, land of warriors and poets, was a realm forged in the fires of struggle and bound by the blood of kings. At its helm stood Rhodri Mawr, a man whose name would echo through the ages as a beacon of strength and unity.

## Chapter One: The Unifier

Rhodri the Great of Wales battling the Saxons on Welsh soil. 

As dawn broke over the mountains, casting a golden hue upon the land, Rhodri surveyed his kingdom with a gaze as fierce as the falcon's. He was a man of towering stature, with a mane of raven-black hair and eyes that gleamed like polished steel. From his seat in the ancient fortress of Dinas Emrys, he ruled with a firm hand and a noble heart, seeking to unite the fractious Welsh tribes under a single banner.

But Rhodri's path to greatness was fraught with peril, for the winds of war blew fiercely across the land. To the east, the Saxons encroached upon Welsh soil, their armies hungry for conquest. To the west, the sea roiled with Viking longships, their dragon-headed prows bearing death and destruction. And within Gwynedd itself, rival princes vied for power, their ambitions threatening to tear the kingdom apart.

# Biography

[Rhodri ap Merfyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodri_Mawr) (c. 820–878), later known as Rhodri the Great (Welsh: Rhodri Mawr), succeeded his father, Merfyn Frych, as King of Gwynedd in 844. Rhodri annexed Powys c. 856 and Seisyllwg c. 871. He is called "King of the Britons" by the Annals of Ulster. In some later histories, he is referred to as "King of Wales", although the title is anachronistic and his realm did not include southern Wales.

## Religion

During Rhodri's time, Christianity was the dominant religion in Wales, as it had been since the Roman period. While specific details about Rhodri's personal religious beliefs are not extensively documented, it is widely accepted that he was a Christian, as Christianity had become firmly established among the Welsh nobility by his era.

Rhodri's descendants, notably his son Hywel Dda (Hywel the Good), who further consolidated the kingdoms of Wales, were also associated with Christian institutions and were instrumental in the spread of Christianity throughout Wales during the medieval period.

Rhodri the Great, like most of the Welsh nobility of his time, would have likely adhered to Christianity as it was practiced within the Western Church, specifically within **the Latin Rite**, which was the dominant form of Christianity in Western Europe during the medieval period.

The Latin Rite refers to the liturgical and canonical practices associated with the Latin Church, which was **under the authority of the Pope in Rome**. This form of Christianity included sacraments such as baptism, confirmation, Eucharist (communion), confession, marriage, holy orders, and anointing of the sick, all administered according to the customs and regulations of **the Roman Catholic Church**.

It's important to note that during Rhodri's time, there was not yet a significant schism between the Western (Roman Catholic) and Eastern (Orthodox) branches of Christianity, which occurred later in the 11th century. Therefore, Christianity in Wales during Rhodri's reign would have aligned with the practices and beliefs of the wider Western Christian tradition under the authority of the Pope.

## Lineage and inheritance

Rhodri was the son of Merfyn Frych, who had claimed Gwynedd upon the extinction of Cunedda's male line. Rhodri then inherited the realm after his father's death around 844. Merfyn hailed from "Manaw" which may either refer to the Isle of Man or Manau, the ancestral homeland of all Gwynedd's kings since Cunedda.

According to later genealogies, his mother or grandmother was Nest ferch Cadell of the ruling dynasty in Powys. Although surviving texts of Welsh law expressly forbid inheritance along the maternal line, Nest and Rhodri's supposed inheritance was later used to justify Gwynedd's annexation of Powys after the c. 855 death of Cyngen ap Cadell in preference to Cyngen's other heirs.

Similarly, Rhodri's marriage to Angharad ferch Meurig was used to explain his supposed inheritance of her brother Gwgon's kingdom of Ceredigion after that king's death in 872[a] via a principle of jure uxoris that does not survive in our sources for Welsh law.

## Reign 855-878
Now the master of much of modern Wales, Rhodri faced pressure both from the English and, increasingly, from Vikings, called the "black gentiles"[b] in the Welsh sources. The Danish are recorded ravaging Anglesey in 854. In 856, Rhodri won a notable victory and killed their leader Gorm.

The Chronicle of the Princes records two victories by Rhodri in 872: the first at a place given variously as Bangolau,[1] Bann Guolou,[2] or Bannoleu,[3] where he defeated the Vikings on Anglesey "in a hard battle"[1] and the second at Manegid[1] or Enegyd[4] where the Vikings "were destroyed".

The Chronicle of the Princes records his death occurring at the Battle of Sunday on Anglesey in 873;[1] the Annals of Wales record the two events in different years[2][3] and Phillimore's reconstruction of its dates places Rhodri's death in 877.[2] According to the Chronicle, Rhodri and his brother Gwriad were killed during a Saxon invasion (which probably would have been under Ceolwulf of Mercia, given that the Wessex forces under Alfred the Great were fighting Vikings in East Anglia at the time). The Annals record no great details of the death, but where the B text calls Gwriad Rhodri's brother,[3] the A text has him as Rhodri's son instead.[2] It is likely he was killed in battle given that all the sources call his son Anarawd's victory over the Mercians at the Battle of the Conwy a few years later "God's vengeance for Rhodri".

## Succession
Rhodri died leaving at least four sons to share his land among themselves. The traditional account is that his eldest, Anarawd, became king of Gwynedd and the head of the subsequent House of Aberffraw which produced Gruffudd ap Cynan and Llywelyn the Great. Another, Cadell, was given Ceredigion and killed his brother Merfyn to claim Powys as well. Cadell's family was later known as the House of Dinefwr, after its base of operations was moved by Hywel the Good to Dyfed following another (supposed) inheritance via his marriage to Elen ferch Llywarch. Hywel's wide domain, later known as Deheubarth, briefly eclipsed Gwynedd under his immediate heirs before fracturing.

A fourth son, possibly too young to have been considered for the first division of Rhodri's lands, took part in Anarawd's 881 revenge against Mercia and, wounded there, became known to history as Tudwal the Lame, a condition disqualifying him from rule under Cyfraith Hywel, Welsh customary law.

## Children
Anarawd ap Rhodri (died 913)
Cadell ap Rhodri (854–907)
Gwriad ap Rhodri
Tudwal ap Rhodri (born 860)

Cawley states that Rhodri and his wife Angharad had four children, and names Gwriad, Anarawd, Cadell, and Merfyn. Boyer, by contrast, following Bartrum, names six children (Anarawd, Cadell, Merfyn, Aeddan, Meurig, and Nest) by his first wife, two (Tudwal Gloff and Elise) by his second, and an additional four (Gwyddelig, Rhodri Fychan, Gwriad, and a daughter) undetermined.
