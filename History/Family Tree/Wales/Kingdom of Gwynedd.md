The kingdom of Gwynedd emerged during the early medieval period, likely around the 5th century AD, as the Britons in the region sought to organize themselves in the face of increasing pressure from Anglo-Saxon invaders. It was founded by Cunedda, a legendary figure often associated with the migration of the Celtic Britons from the region of modern-day Scotland to Wales. Cunedda and his descendants established themselves as rulers in northwest Wales, laying the foundation for the kingdom of Gwynedd.

Over the centuries, Gwynedd grew in size and power, eventually becoming one of the most dominant kingdoms in Wales. Its rulers, such as Rhodri Mawr and Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, sought to consolidate their authority and extend their influence over neighboring regions. Gwynedd reached its zenith under rulers like Llywelyn the Great, who successfully expanded its borders and asserted its independence in the face of English aggression.

Gwynedd played a pivotal role in the conflicts between the Welsh and English during the medieval period, often serving as a focal point for resistance against English domination. The kingdom experienced periods of stability and prosperity, as well as times of internal strife and external threats.

In times past my ancestors were Kings and warriors. They occupied their time protecting the Gwynedd kingdom from Viking attacks, and the threat of the Saxons. We are no longer needed for such endeavors. The threat of war is behind us, and strategic battle planning and fighting is a trait wasted on our bloodline. Instead of protecting 30,000 people from destruction, we will create cities and businesses. Our role is now to build rather than protect. The world at large keeps its countries accountable. Vikings would not be tolerated in any country. The US has emerged as the world power, and its forces would quickly obliterate such marauding groups. We recognized the opportunity of a better world when Lodowick Davis moved our bloodline from England into Maryland in 1736, soon to be independent from Great Britain.

I am not Scottish, and not Irish, and not German, and not Welsh. I am the combination of all of them into a single unit, taking the best each bloodline has to offer. I come from kings of Welsh descent, noblemen and knights from English descent, kings from Russian decent, kings from Irish descent, men of God from Scotland and Germany. I have warriors blood and I have spiritual veins. I have inherited strength of iron and strength of mind, and a spiritual inheritance from my mother's side. Pieces of the puzzle that each of my ancestors took lifetimes to gather are all combined into me. And now I pass it on, combining it with an heritage never yet known to any of my ancestors. I bring to my children all that I am, and all that Mariana is, to grow the strongest generation after me.

Rhodri was called great, but I take no wisdom from him. Look at me now, Rhodri, if you can see from the depths of hell. Your seed covered the earth, but I alone have achieved the awakening. Did Pope Nicholas save you from death? Did he enlighten your eyes to trust in Jesus? Or did he give you sacraments and works to trust in as your pathway to our one and only God? You were a great man, but now you are least. I take no comfort in your heritage. My heritage is from the Carlson's who feared God and gave their life in service to Christ. Your lineage was one of betrayal and self-service. I do not take my Welsh heritage in my bones. What I gained from you was corruption, and I am stronger from other ancestors than from your kingly sons.
