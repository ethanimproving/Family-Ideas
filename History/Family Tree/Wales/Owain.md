He became known as Owain Gwynedd to distinguish him from the contemporary king of southern Powys, Owain ap Gruffydd ap Maredudd, who became known as "Owain Cyfeiliog".

Owain ap Gruffudd (c. 1100 – 23 or 28 November 1170) was King of Gwynedd, north Wales, from 1137 until his death in 1170.  ==Considered to be the most successful of all the North Welsh princes==.   

## Relationships

He was also put under pressure by the Archbishop and the Pope to put aside his second wife, Cristin, who was his first cousin, this relationship making the marriage invalid under church law.  Owain died in 1169, and ==despite having been excommunicated== was buried in Bangor Cathedral by the local clergy. 

## Children

He had a number of illegitimate sons, who by Welsh law had an equal claim on the inheritance if acknowledged by their father.  The following children from two wives and at least four mistresses:

## Issue
Owain was married twice, his first wife Gwladys ferch Llywarch ap Trahaearn, was the mother of two of his sons, Maelgwn ab Owain Gwynedd and Iorwerth Drwyndwn, the father of Llywelyn the Great, by Christina, his second wife he had three sons including Dafydd ab Owain Gwynedd and Rhodri ab Owain Gwynedd. He also had a number of illegitimate sons, who by Welsh law had an equal claim on the inheritance if acknowledged by their father. Thus feuding did not end until his grandson Llywelyn ab Iorwerth (Llywelyn the Great), became prince of Gwynedd.[4]
