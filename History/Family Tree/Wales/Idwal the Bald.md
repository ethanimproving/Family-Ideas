# Idwal Foel: Defender of Gwynedd

## Chapter One: Inheritance of a Kingdom

In the rugged hills of medieval Wales, amidst the windswept landscapes of Gwynedd, a young prince ascended to the throne, inheriting a legacy of power and responsibility from his illustrious father. Idwal Foel, known as Idwal the Bald, succeeded his father, Anarawd ap Rhodri, as the King of Gwynedd in the 10th century.

Raised in the shadow of his father's reign, Idwal grew to embody the resilience and determination of the Welsh people. With the weight of the kingdom resting on his shoulders, he faced the daunting task of upholding his family's legacy and safeguarding the future of Gwynedd in an era marked by uncertainty and upheaval.

## Chapter Two: Alliances and Diplomacy

As the new king of Gwynedd, Idwal wasted no time in forging strategic alliances to secure his kingdom's borders and ensure its survival in the face of external threats. Aligning himself with Æthelstan of England, who sought to establish his authority across Britain, Idwal honored his allegiance by visiting the English court on multiple occasions.

In 927, 928, and 937, Idwal journeyed to the English court, signing charters and pledging his support to Æthelstan's campaigns against the Scots. Alongside his fellow Welsh rulers, he marched against Owain ap Dyfnwal, King of Strathclyde, forcing him to submit to the English king's authority.

## Chapter Three: The Clash with Saxons

With the death of Æthelstan and the accession of his half-brother Edmund to the English throne, Idwal's position in Gwynedd became increasingly precarious. Fearing that the Saxons would support Hywel in usurping his throne, Idwal took decisive action, launching an attack on the Saxons in Wales alongside his brother Elisedd.

In 942, Idwal and Elisedd led their forces into battle against the Saxons, seeking to assert their dominance and secure their hold on Gwynedd. However, their ambitions were thwarted, and the annals record their defeat: "Idwal and his brother Elisedd are killed in battle against the Saxons."

## Chapter Four: Legacy and Succession

Despite his untimely demise, Idwal's legacy endured, a testament to his bravery and commitment to the defense of Gwynedd. His sons, Iago and Ieuaf, should have inherited the throne upon his death, but their claim was challenged by Hywel of Deheubarth.

For eight years, Hywel ruled over Gwynedd, driving Idwal's sons from their rightful kingdom. Yet, in time, Iago and Ieuaf would return, reclaiming their heritage.
