There are a lot of [sex offenders](https://www.propertyiq.com/tx/dallas/oakmore-drive/75249-piq4240195) in the area. They are almost all black people with a charge of "Sexual Assault of a Child." Each dot marks a person that the government should have put to death. You shouldn't be able to molest a child and still live. This is not justice.

It takes awhile to navigate to the right place. You will want to land right about here. In the layer list, check `Dallas Tax Parcels`, `Zoning Grid`, `BI Office Boundries`, `BI Districts`, `Base Zoning`, `Council Districts`, `Census Tracts`, and `City limits`. I like the Topographic and the OpenStreetMap Basemap the best.
