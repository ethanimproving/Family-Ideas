[Tenison Village](https://www.ashtonwoods.com/dallas/tenison) is in an ideal location, balanced between church, home, and work. It is a bit expensive, but possibly wroth the high price.

Price range: $366,000 - $477,000

# Negations

- Expensive
- Close to the highway

# Map View

Seems to be in a good location. A little close to the highway, but would have to visit to know if the sound would be noticeable.
