# Where To Shop

> I put Armstrong peel & stick tiles in our kitchen around 20 years ago. Installed it right on top of existing vinyl floor. After all these years, three sons, four grandsons, dogs, cats, spills, etc....still looks great. A couple years ago I tried the same thing in our bathrooms but used Home Depot's TrafficMaster tiles. They started discoloring after a few days. They look absolutely horrible. The difference in quality is massive. ~ [Jamie Madison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCaJeU5052M)
