# Threshold Bolt

It's a mechanism designed to secure double doors in place by latching them into the threshold or sill, providing added security and stability.

The threshold bolt typically consists of a metal piece that moves vertically, allowing it to engage with holes or recesses in the door sill when the doors are closed. This prevents the doors from swinging open unintentionally. When you want to open the doors, you can lift the metal piece to disengage the lock and release the doors.

These types of threshold bolts are often used in conjunction with double doors, especially French doors, to enhance security and ensure that both door panels remain securely closed.

# Door Swelling

My doors tend to stick together in the evening when it's hot. If I push the main door in, the secondary door bows with it. This is not uncommon, especially with wooden doors, and it's often related to temperature and humidity changes. This phenomenon is known as "door swelling" or "door binding." Here's an explanation of what might be happening:

1. **Temperature and Humidity:** Wood is a natural material that can expand and contract with changes in temperature and humidity. In the evening, when it's hot and humid, the doors may absorb moisture from the air, causing them to expand. This expansion can result in the doors sticking together or binding.
    
2. **Warpage:** When the doors expand due to increased moisture, they can also warp slightly, causing them to bow or twist. This warping can exacerbate the sticking issue you're experiencing.
    
3. **Pressure Transfer:** When you push the main door, the pressure you apply can transfer to the secondary door, causing it to bow along with the main door. This can make the sticking problem more noticeable.
    

To address this issue, you might consider the following steps:

1. **Weatherstripping:** Check the weatherstripping around the doors. Proper weatherstripping can help create a barrier against humidity and prevent excessive moisture absorption.
    
2. **Maintain Ventilation:** Adequate ventilation can help regulate indoor humidity levels. Using exhaust fans, dehumidifiers, or air conditioning can help reduce humidity, which in turn can minimize the expansion of the doors.
    
3. **Door Adjustments:** If the doors are consistently sticking, you might need to adjust the alignment of the doors within the door frame. Consult a professional carpenter or handyman who can assess the doors and make appropriate adjustments to ensure they open and close smoothly.
    
4. **Sealing and Finishing:** Applying a proper sealant or finish to the doors can help minimize moisture absorption. Consult with a professional or a paint specialist to choose the right product for your doors.
    
5. **Regular Maintenance:** Regularly inspect and maintain your doors. Check for signs of warping, swelling, or sticking, and address any issues promptly.
    
6. **Consider Material:** If the problem persists and is particularly troublesome, you might also consider alternative door materials that are less prone to swelling and warping due to humidity changes.
    

Keep in mind that wooden doors are more susceptible to these issues compared to doors made from other materials like steel or fiberglass. Addressing the underlying causes and making appropriate adjustments can help alleviate the sticking problem and ensure that your doors function smoothly throughout different weather conditions.
