To get rid of a small tree growing in the cracks of your patio, you can try these steps:

1. **Pulling and Digging:** Use a pair of gloves and try to manually pull out the tree, including its roots. If the roots are deeply entrenched, you might need to dig around the base of the tree to expose and remove them.

2. **Vinegar Solution:** Pour a mixture of water and white vinegar onto the base of the tree. The acidity of the vinegar could help weaken the tree's roots over time.

3. **Boiling Water:** Pour boiling water directly onto the tree's base. This can potentially scorch the plant and make it easier to remove.

4. **Salt Solution:** Create a solution using water and salt. Pour it onto the base of the tree. Be cautious with this method, as salt can also affect the soil and nearby plants.

5. **Herbicide:** You could consider using a non-selective herbicide, such as glyphosate. Apply it carefully to the leaves and stems of the tree. Follow the instructions on the herbicide label.

6. **Physical Barrier:** Once you've removed the tree, consider placing a physical barrier like landscape fabric or a sturdy filler to prevent future growth in the cracks.

Remember, it might take some time and effort to fully eliminate the tree, as some methods might require multiple applications or treatments.
