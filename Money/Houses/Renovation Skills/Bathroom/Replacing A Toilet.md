## Place Toilet on Flange

1. Rest new toilet on its side on top of towel or blanket on floor so it doesn’t get scratched or damaged during installation.
2. Install new wax ring onto flange on floor with tapered end facing up.
3. Rest toilet bowl upside down on towel or blanket next to flange so you can attach wax ring without having to hold bowl up at same time.

## Install Wax Ring

1. Line up bolts with holes in base of bowl and carefully lower bowl onto wax ring and flange so bolts come through holes in base of bowl.

## Install Toilet Bolts
