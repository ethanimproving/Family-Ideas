Raising the ceiling in your shower is a major renovation project that involves several steps and careful planning. Keep in mind that this task can be complex and may require professional assistance, especially if you're dealing with structural changes. Here's an overview of the steps and equipment you might need:

**1. Assess Feasibility:**

- Determine if there are any structural considerations that might affect raising the ceiling.
- Check local building codes and regulations to ensure you're compliant.

**2. Plan and Design:**

- Decide how much you want to raise the ceiling by and create a design plan.
- Consider the location of fixtures, lighting, ventilation, and any other elements that might need to be adjusted.

**3. Consult Professionals:**

- Enlist the help of an architect or structural engineer to assess the feasibility of the project and provide recommendations.
- Consult with a general contractor who specializes in remodeling projects.

**4. Obtain Permits:**

- If required by local regulations, obtain necessary permits for the renovation.

**5. Demolition:**

- Remove the existing ceiling, fixtures, and any other elements that need to be changed.

**6. Structural Changes:**

- If the ceiling is load-bearing, the structural engineer will guide any necessary changes to support the new ceiling height.

**7. Electrical and Plumbing:**

- Reroute electrical wiring and plumbing as needed to accommodate the new ceiling height.

**8. Framing and Drywall:**

- Build a new framework for the higher ceiling.
- Install new drywall to create the new ceiling surface.

**9. Finishing:**

- Apply paint or other finishes to the new ceiling surface.
- Install new fixtures, lighting, and ventilation as per the design plan.

**10. Cleanup and Inspection:**

- Clean up the work area and dispose of debris.
- Schedule inspections to ensure the work meets building codes and regulations.

**Equipment and Tools:**

- Safety gear (protective eyewear, gloves, etc.).
- Measuring tools (tape measure, level, etc.).
- Power tools (drills, saws, etc.).
- Drywall tools (trowels, joint compound, etc.).
- Painting supplies (paint, brushes, rollers, etc.).
- Depending on the scope, you might need scaffolding, ladders, or other equipment for reaching high areas.

Remember, this is a general overview and the specifics can vary based on your existing structure, local regulations, and the extent of changes you're making. Due to the complexity of this project, it's highly recommended to consult with professionals who can provide guidance and ensure that the renovation is done safely and effectively.
