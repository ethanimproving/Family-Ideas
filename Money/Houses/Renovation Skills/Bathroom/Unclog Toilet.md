## How to Unclog a Toilet - Methods and Steps

### Method 1: Bucket of Water

**Steps:**

1. Fill a bucket with about two to two and a half gallons of water.
2. Pour the water directly into the toilet bowl.
3. This works best when the water level in the bowl is low or medium.
4. Hydrostatic pressure from the water helps push down obstructions.

**Equipment:**

- Bucket

### Method 2: Plunger

**Steps:**

1. Use a plunger with a narrow opening to create focused pressure.
2. Fill the plunger with water from the toilet bowl.
3. Ensure the plunger is fully covering the drain and create a seal.
4. Push and pull the plunger vigorously to dislodge the obstruction.
5. If the water level is rising too high, pause and let it drain.
6. Repeat the plunging process until the water flushes effectively.

**Equipment:**

- Plunger

### Method 3: Toilet Snake (Closet Auger)

**Steps:**

1. Use a closet auger (toilet snake) with a protective boot.
2. Insert the auger into the toilet bowl drain.
3. Push the auger while turning the handle to navigate through the drain.
4. If you encounter resistance, gently maneuver the auger to break up the clog.
5. Carefully retract the auger, keeping it inside the protective boot.
6. Dispose of any debris caught by the auger.

**Equipment:**

- Closet auger (toilet snake)
- Protective boot

### Method 4: Cleaning Bladder

**Steps:**

1. Obtain a toilet cleaning bladder designed for unclogging.
2. Attach the cleaning bladder to a water source, such as a hose or sink faucet.
3. Insert the cleaning bladder into the toilet bowl drain.
4. Turn on the water source to fill the bladder with water.
5. The expanding bladder exerts pressure to dislodge the clog.
6. Once pressure builds up, the clog should be pushed through the drain.

**Equipment:**

- Toilet cleaning bladder
- Water source (hose or sink faucet)
