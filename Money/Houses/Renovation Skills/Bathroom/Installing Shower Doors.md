# Why Is It Priced At $700?

## Thicker glass

The price of a shower door can vary depending on the materials used, the size of the door, and the features it offers. [The Essence 56 to 60 in. x 76 in. Semi-Frameless Sliding Shower Door in Brushed Nickel](https://www.homedepot.com/p/DreamLine-Essence-56-to-60-in-x-76-in-Semi-Frameless-Sliding-Shower-Door-in-Brushed-Nickel-SHDR-6360760-04/300078596) is priced higher than the [Alliance Pro BG 60 in. W x 70.375 in. H Sliding Semi Frameless Shower Door in Oil Rubbed Bronze with Clear Glass](https://www.homedepot.com/p/DreamLine-Alliance-Pro-ML-60-in-W-x-70-5-in-H-Sliding-Semi-Frameless-Shower-Door-in-Oil-Rubbed-Bronze-with-Clear-Glass-SDAM60W700VXX06/320611871) because it is made of different materials and has different features. The Essence shower door is made of thicker glass (5/16 inch) compared to the Alliance Pro BG shower door (1/4 inch) which makes it **more durable and long-lasting**.

## Stain-resistant glass coating

The Essence shower door also has a ClearMax water and stain-resistant glass coating which makes it **easier to clean and maintain** compared to the Alliance Pro BG shower door which does not have this feature
