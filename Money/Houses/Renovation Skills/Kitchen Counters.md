# Slab Choices

1. **Quartz**: Quartz countertops are engineered stone surfaces made of approximately 90% natural quartz combined with resin binders. They offer a wide range of colors and patterns, are highly durable, non-porous, and resistant to stains and scratches. Quartz countertops require minimal maintenance and are popular for their strength and longevity. ![](https://www.quartztopsandmore.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Venatino-Marmi-1024x524.jpg)
    
2. **Granite**: Granite countertops are natural stone surfaces known for their elegance and durability. They come in a variety of colors and patterns and offer a unique, natural look to the kitchen. Granite is heat-resistant, scratch-resistant, and relatively low-maintenance when sealed properly. It is a timeless choice that adds value to a home. ![](https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/tmPydZI3rXEtKGWj1z0VcMm_CnI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cost-of-granite-countertops-1822205_hero_10733-1b3c02a587b74886a31a2ef2f17270eb.jpg)
    
3. **Marble**: Marble countertops are highly prized for their luxurious appearance and classic beauty. They come in various colors and veining patterns, offering a touch of elegance to the kitchen. However, marble is a softer and more porous material than quartz or granite, making it more susceptible to stains and etching. Regular sealing and careful maintenance are recommended for marble countertops. ![](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/images/products/ekbacken-countertop-white-marble-effect-laminate__1049982_pe844569_s5.jpg)
    
4. **Solid Surface**: Solid surface countertops, such as Corian, are synthetic materials that offer versatility in terms of color, design, and shape. They are non-porous, hygienic, and relatively low-maintenance. Solid surface countertops can be seamlessly integrated with sinks and offer easy repairability for scratches or minor damages. ![](https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/1ndk9YdAZnpsafPVBAtZU3vHWjM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/best-solid-surface-counter-brands-1821254_hero_11074-f7ca9350d2124fb580ebb3bc6064785c.jpg)
    
5. **Laminate**: Laminate countertops are ==affordable== and come in a wide range of colors, patterns, and finishes, including options that mimic the look of natural stone. They are low-maintenance, resistant to stains and heat, and can be an excellent budget-friendly choice for kitchen countertops. ![](https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/laminate_0521.jpg?d=780x520)
    
6. **Stainless Steel**: Stainless steel countertops provide a sleek and contemporary look to the kitchen. They are highly durable, heat-resistant, and hygienic. Stainless steel countertops are commonly found in commercial kitchens, but they can also work well in residential settings, especially in modern or industrial-style kitchens. ![](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/80/63/1d/80631d12f74acc0f9a10493226655111.jpg)
    
7. **Concrete**: Concrete countertops offer a customizable and unique look with endless color and texture possibilities. They are highly durable and heat-resistant, but proper sealing is required to prevent staining. Concrete countertops can be tailored to suit various design styles, from modern to rustic. ![](https://www.familyhandyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/custom-kitchen-portfolio-by-concrete-wave-design-concrete-countertops-boardformed-board-formed-19.jpg?resize=768,768)
