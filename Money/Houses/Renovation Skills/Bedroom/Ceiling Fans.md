## What if there's no outlet box?

Electrical boxes serve several functions. They protect wiring where insulation has been removed. They prevent inadvertent contact with exposed components. They contain sparks when the worst occurs. And they provide standard mounting points for fixtures.

I'd be inclined to "code things up" with a wraparound box like so:

### Pancake Box

We had to mark the drywall with a sharpie using the pancake box as a drawing aid. Then we used a [drywall knife](https://www.homedepot.com/p/DEWALT-6-in-Jab-Saw-with-Composite-Handle-DWHT20540/203040561) to cut that circle out, and an exacto knife where the stud was. After that we used [cable clamp connectors](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Halex-3-8-in-Non-Metallic-NM-Twin-Screw-Cable-Clamp-Connectors-5-Pack-20511/100133208) to feed the cables through the pancake box and screwed the pancake box directly into the stud with a [Dewalt impact drill](https://www.homedepot.com/p/DEWALT-20-Volt-Maximum-XR-Cordless-Brushless-1-4-in-3-Speed-Impact-Driver-Tool-Only-DCF845B/325543967). From there it was a matter of following the instructions in the fa manual to assemble the fan.

We briefly considered different types of electrical ceiling fan boxes, but this simple metal one was the only one my dad had seen, so it's the one he recommended with the most confidence. I read on ChatGPT that plastic ones are better for electrical stuff because they don't conduct electricity, but at the end of the day what the heck. Who really cares. Metal is more sturdy than plastic.

### Adjustable Bar Hanger Style

These boxes are designed for installations where you want to **mount the box between two wall studs** or ceiling joists while allowing for some adjustability in the positioning of the box. The adjustable bar hanger is used to secure the box between the studs or joists. It can be adjusted to accommodate different stud or joist spacing, making it a versatile option for various electrical installation scenarios.

These boxes are commonly used when installing ceiling fans, heavy light fixtures, or other devices that require **secure mounting between structural supports**. The adjustable bar hanger provides stability and flexibility in positioning the box correctly within the wall or ceiling framing.
