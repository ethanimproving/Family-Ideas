# DIY Vinyl Siding

[How to Replace Damaged Vinyl Siding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz9JoJGWvI4)

## Steps

1. When vinyl siding is first installed, it is nailed through a nailing strip. The bottom of the next course is locked in to the nailing strip of the course below.
2. When replacing siding, try to purchase a piece from the same manufacturer in the same color.
3. Work your hand in to a seam between pieces, then release the siding from the nailing strip.
4. Pull the nails holding the damaged siding and remove the damaged piece.
5. Push the new piece into the nailing strip of the course below.
6. Nail the siding loosely to allow for expansion and contraction.
7. If the whole piece of siding isnâ€™t damaged, the damaged section can be cut away using a utility knife and speed square.
8. Cut the patch long. Remove a piece of the nailing strip and on the back to allow for expansion and contraction.
9. To lock the final piece in place, use a zip tool.
