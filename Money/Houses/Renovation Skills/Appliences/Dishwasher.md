# Guide to Choosing a Dishwasher

When shopping for a dishwasher for your home, there are several important factors to consider. I am looking for a built-in standard energy star certified dishwasher with a noise level less than 45dB.

# 1. Type of Dishwasher

|Type|Description|
|---|---|
|**Built-in**|Integrated into kitchen cabinets.|
|Portable|Stand-alone unit on wheels, not built-in.|
|Drawer|Dishwasher with separate drawers.|
|Countertop|Compact unit designed to sit on countertops.|

Choose the type that fits your kitchen layout and space.
# 2. Size and Capacity

|Size Class|Description|
|---|---|
|Standard|24-inch width, 35-inch height.|
|Compact|Smaller, ideal for smaller kitchens.|

Consider the size based on the number of place settings and your kitchen space.

# 3. Energy Efficiency

Look for the [Energy Star](https://www.energystar.gov/) label, which indicates that the dishwasher meets energy efficiency standards and will save you on energy bills.

| Energy Efficiency Level | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Energy Specifications (Wattage, Amperage, Voltage)                                                            |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Energy Star Certified ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Energy_Star_logo.svg/800px-Energy_Star_logo.svg.png)    | Dishwashers with this certification meet or exceed specific energy efficiency guidelines set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Energy (DOE). They are among the most energy-efficient options available. | Wattage: Typically 1200-1500W, Amperage: 10-12A, Voltage: 120V                                                |
| High Efficiency (HE)    | HE dishwashers are designed to be energy-efficient but may not meet the strict Energy Star requirements. They still offer above-average energy savings compared to standard models.                                                       | Wattage: Usually 1300-1600W, Amperage: 11-13A, Voltage: 120V                                                  |
| Standard Efficiency     | These dishwashers meet the minimum energy efficiency standards required by regulations but may not be as energy-efficient as Energy Star or HE models.                                                                                    | Wattage: Typically 1500-1800W, Amperage: 12-15A, Voltage: 120V                                                |
| Not Specified           | Some dishwashers may not clearly specify their energy efficiency level. Be sure to review the manufacturer's information and consider other factors, such as annual energy consumption, to assess their efficiency.                       | Review the manufacturer's specifications for wattage, amperage, and voltage to determine energy requirements. |


# 4. Cleaning and Wash Cycles

|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|Number of Cycles|More options allow customization.|
|Soil Sensors|Adjusts cycle based on soil level.|
|Pre-rinse Cycle|Helps with heavily soiled dishes.|
|Sanitization|Kills germs and bacteria.|

I have a house rule to rinse dishes before loading them into the dishwasher, so I don't expect heavily soiled dishes will be an issue.

# 5. Noise Level

Consider the noise level in decibels (dB). Quieter dishwashers are generally more desirable for open kitchen layouts.

| Noise Level (dB) | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| 50 or higher     | Loud        |
| 45-49            | Moderate    |
| **Below 45**         | Quiet       |

# 6. Interior Material

Dishwasher interiors are typically made of **stainless steel** or plastic. Stainless steel is more durable and better at preventing odors.

# 7. Additional Features

|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|Delay Start|Allows you to start a cycle later.|
|Adjustable Racks|Customize rack configuration.|
|Cutlery Tray or Basket|For easy silverware loading.|
|Wi-Fi Connectivity|Control and monitor remotely.|

Consider these features to enhance convenience.

# 8. Price and Budget

Set a budget and compare dishwashers within your price range.

| Price Range | Description                                                                                   |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cheap       | $250 - $500 or less. Budget-friendly options with basic features and older models.            |
| Moderate    | $500 - $1,000. A mid-range selection with a balance of features and quality.                  |
| Expensive   | $1,000 and above. Premium models with advanced features, high durability, and modern designs. |

# 9. Brand and Reliability

Research reputable dishwasher brands known for reliability, quality, and good customer service.
