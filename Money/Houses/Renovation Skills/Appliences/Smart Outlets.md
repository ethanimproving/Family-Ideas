These smart outlets built into the wall offer convenience and control by allowing you to turn devices on or off remotely using your smartphone or voice commands. Before purchasing, ensure compatibility with your home's electrical system and check if it supports the desired smart home platform or voice assistant you prefer.

Make sure your app allows you to toggle each plug separately. If you have a lamp and your phone plugged into the same outlet, you don't want the phone to turn off with your lamp.
