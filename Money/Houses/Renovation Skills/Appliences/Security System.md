# How Many Cameras Do I Need?

## 4 Outdoor
1. Front door (Doorbell)
2. Back door
3. Garage Door (With light)
4. Back Yard

## 4 Indoor
1. Living Room
2. Master Room (4K)
3. Sun Room
4. Garage



## SD Cards
[SanDisk MicroSD Cards (128GB)](https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Extreme-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B09X7BK27V/ref=sr_1_4) @ $15

$$$15 * 8 = $120$$

# Wyze Bundle

Cost: $285

# Blink Bundle

Cost: $265

No 4k cam, but you save about $120 by eliminating SD cards compared to Wyze. I do like the Sync Module. I'm going to say Wyze is the winner on this because of the choppy 10 second clips you get with Blink.
