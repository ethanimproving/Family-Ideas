# Ozone Machine

## How it Works

An ozone generator works by electrifying a couple ceramic plats to create ozone. Ozone is the term used when 3 oxygen atoms are together instead of just 2 or 1. ==The third oxygen atom is extremely unstable, so it tries to find something suitable to oxidize with. The easiest thing is something organic, so when it gets close to that organic material, it violently oxidizes.==

Destroying that organic matter and leaving with something oxidized. It oxidizes with many different organic and inorganic materials, so there is no specific chemical reaction to put into words. So, in the video, the purple material had something that the ozone could oxidize with, destroying the purple material.

Vinegar is known for its acidic nature and is often **used for odor elimination**. It can help break down and neutralize odors, including smoke smells. Vinegar is particularly useful for absorbing and eliminating odors on porous surfaces like walls.

Dawn dish soap, on the other hand, is a powerful grease and stain remover. It is effective in **cutting through grease, oils, and residues** that may be present on surfaces. While it may not have the same odor-neutralizing properties as vinegar, it can help in removing smoke residue and general dirt or grime from surfaces.

When it comes to removing smoke smells, the best approach may involve using both vinegar and Dawn dish soap, depending on the specific situation. Here's a suggested method:

1. Vinegar: Use a vinegar solution (equal parts vinegar and water) to spray and wipe down the walls. This will help neutralize the smoke odor and penetrate porous surfaces.
    
2. Dawn dish soap: Create a solution of warm water and a few drops of Dawn dish soap. Use a sponge or cloth dampened with this solution to gently scrub the walls, focusing on areas with visible residue or stubborn stains. Rinse with clean water afterward.
