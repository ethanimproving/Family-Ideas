I just removed the carpet from my floor and there appears to be patches of concrete on top of the slab. It must have splattered there during construction. Is it possible to remove it so that the slab is smooth again?

Yes, it is possible to remove patches of concrete from a slab to restore a smooth surface. Here are a few methods commonly used to remove concrete splatters or patches:

1. **Grinding**: Concrete grinding involves using a specialized grinder with diamond abrasive discs to grind down the concrete surface. This method is effective for removing thin patches of concrete and achieving a smooth finish. However, it can be time-consuming and may generate a significant amount of dust.
    
2. **Chiseling and Hammering**: For thicker concrete patches, you can use a chisel and hammer to break up the concrete and then remove it manually. This method is suitable for small areas or when dealing with particularly stubborn concrete patches.
    
3. **Chemical Removers**: There are [concrete chemical removers](https://www.homedepot.com/p/ECOLAB-1-Gal-Fast-Action-Floor-Stripper-7700407/321779388) available in the market that can help break down and dissolve concrete patches. These products are applied to the affected areas and allowed to sit for a specific period. They weaken the concrete, making it easier to remove using hand tools or pressure washing.
    
4. **Pressure Washing**: High-pressure water can be used to remove loose or thin concrete patches. A pressure washer with a high-pressure nozzle can effectively blast away the concrete splatters. However, this method may not work for thicker or more adhered patches.
    

It's important to consider the size and extent of the concrete patches, as well as the condition of the underlying slab. If you're unsure about the best approach or if the patches are extensive, it may be beneficial to consult with a professional contractor or concrete specialist who can assess the situation and recommend the most appropriate method for your specific case.
