# Contractor or DIY

Carlos quoted me $11,500, which is reasonable given the amount of time it would take him, but retexturing a wall is not highly skilled work, it just takes a lot of time. **I would be paying him for his time, not his skills**. It makes more sense to pay him to do the higher skilled jobs, and take care of the low-skill jobs myself.

## Scraping

When scraping a wall to remove texture, there are several best practices you can follow to make the process more effective and efficient. Here are some tips:

1. **Prepare the area**: Before you begin scraping, ensure the surrounding area is properly protected. Cover the floor, furniture, and any other items nearby with drop cloths or plastic sheets to catch the debris.
    
2. **Safety precautions**: Wear safety goggles, a dust mask, and gloves to protect yourself from dust and potential injuries during the scraping process.
    
3. **Test a small area**: Start by testing a small section of the wall to determine the best technique and to assess how easily the texture can be removed. This will help you avoid damaging the wall or creating unnecessary work.
    
4. **Soften the texture**: Spraying the wall with water and allowing it to soak for a while can help soften the texture, making it easier to scrape off. Use a spray bottle or a paint sprayer to dampen the wall, but be cautious not to oversaturate it, as excessive moisture can damage the wall material.
    
5. **Use the right tools**: Choose the appropriate scraping tool based on the type and thickness of the texture. A wide putty knife, a drywall knife, or a scraper with a long handle can be effective for scraping. Experiment with different tools to find the one that works best for your specific texture.
    
6. **Scrape in one direction**: Work systematically by scraping in one direction, either horizontally or vertically, across the wall. Apply consistent pressure to remove the texture layer evenly. Avoid scraping back and forth, as it can damage the wall surface.
    
7. **Work in sections**: Divide the wall into manageable sections and focus on one section at a time. This approach ensures thoroughness and prevents the texture from drying out before you have a chance to scrape it off.
    
8. **Clean as you go**: Periodically clean your scraping tool to remove the accumulated texture material. This will help maintain its effectiveness and prevent debris from scratching the wall.
    
9. **Inspect and repair**: After scraping, inspect the wall for any remaining texture or imperfections. Use a sanding block or sandpaper to smooth out any rough spots or residue.
    
10. **Dispose of debris**: Properly dispose of the scraped-off texture and debris according to local regulations. Bag it securely and dispose of it in accordance with your municipality's guidelines.
    

Remember, every wall and texture can be different, so adjust your approach based on the specific characteristics of the surface you are working on. If you encounter challenges or have concerns, it's always a good idea to consult with a professional or seek advice from experienced individuals in the field.

## Skim Entire Wall With Water First

If it doesn't come off easily it's because it either hasn't gotten enough water or hasn't soaked long enough.

Finally got to break out my Level5 tools last week, hands down this knife is the BOMB, highly recommend it, if your only going to get one tool from level 5, this is the one.

# Skim Coat

Skim coating is a technique used to remove texture from a wall by applying a thin layer of joint compound or a specialized skim coat product over the existing surface. The process involves smoothing out the wall to create a flat and even finish. Skim coating is commonly used when dealing with textured walls or surfaces that have imperfections, such as bumps, ridges, or uneven textures.

The skim coat technique involves adding a layer of joint compound or skim coat product to the existing wall surface. It does not remove any layers from the wall but rather applies a thin layer of material over the textured surface. The purpose of the skim coat is to create a smooth and even finish by covering the existing texture or imperfections on the wall.

To skim coat a wall, the following general steps are typically followed:

1. **Preparation**: Clean the wall surface by removing any dust, dirt, or loose particles. Repair any significant damages, such as cracks or holes, with appropriate patching materials.
    
2. **Mixing the skim coat**: Follow the instructions provided with the joint compound or skim coat product to mix it to the desired consistency. The consistency should be similar to thick paint or pancake batter.
    
3. **Application**: Start by applying a thin layer of the skim coat material onto the wall using a trowel or a wide putty knife. Spread the material evenly, covering the entire wall surface. It's important to maintain consistent pressure and avoid leaving any thick or thin areas.
    
4. **Smoothing and feathering**: After applying the initial layer, use a wide taping knife or a drywall trowel to smooth out the surface. Feather the edges to create a seamless transition between the skim coat and the surrounding wall. This process helps to eliminate any visible lines or marks.
    
5. **Drying and sanding**: Allow the skim coat to dry completely according to the manufacturer's instructions. Once dry, lightly sand the surface with fine-grit sandpaper to further smooth out any imperfections and create a smooth finish.
    
6. **Repeat if necessary**: Depending on the desired result and the condition of the wall, it may be necessary to apply additional skim coats. Each layer should be applied after the previous one has dried and been sanded.
    

Skim coating can be a time-consuming process that requires some skill to achieve a professional-looking result. It is often recommended to seek guidance from experienced professionals or tutorials if you are attempting skim coating for the first time.
