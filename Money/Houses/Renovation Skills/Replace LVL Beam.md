# What Is An LVL Beam?

An LVL beam, also known as a **laminated veneer lumber beam**, is a type of engineered wood product commonly used in construction. LVL beams are made by *bonding thin layers of wood veneers together with adhesives*. The veneers are typically oriented with the grain direction parallel to the length of the beam.

LVL beams are known for their strength, stability, and dimensional consistency. They are designed to have *high load-carrying capacity* and resistance to warping, twisting, and shrinking. LVL beams are often used as structural members in residential and commercial construction, particularly for carrying heavy loads over long spans.

LVL beams come in various sizes and can be customized based on the specific load and span requirements of a project. They are commonly used as headers or beams in floor and roof systems, as well as in framing applications such as beams, joists, and lintels. LVL beams offer an alternative to traditional solid wood beams and provide greater strength and reliability in many construction applications.
