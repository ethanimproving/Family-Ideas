# Equipment

1. **New Garbage Disposal:** Purchase a new garbage disposal unit that matches the size and power requirements of your existing setup.
    
2. **Plumber's Putty or Rubber Gasket:** You'll need one of these to create a watertight seal between the sink flange and the sink itself.
    
3. **Screwdriver:** A standard screwdriver will be required for loosening and tightening screws and connections.
    
4. **Adjustable Wrench:** This tool is used to tighten and secure various nuts and bolts during the installation process.
    
5. **Hammer:** You may need a hammer for gently tapping the sink flange into place or for minor adjustments.
    
6. **Bucket or Bowl:** Have a bucket or bowl ready to catch any excess water that may come out when you disconnect the old disposal.
    
7. **Pliers:** Pliers can help with holding and positioning different components during installation.
    
8. **Wire Nuts and Electrical Tape:** If your new garbage disposal requires wiring, you may need wire nuts and electrical tape for secure connections.
    
9. **Pipe Wrench or Channel Locks:** These tools are useful for disconnecting and reconnecting the plumbing connections.
    
10. **Plumbing Tape (Teflon Tape):** This tape is used to create a watertight seal on threaded connections.
