[LG 4.5 cu. ft. Combination ELECTRIC Front Load Washer/Dryer with Allergiene Cycle](https://www.costco.com/lg-4.5-cu.-ft.-combination-electric-front-load-washer/dryer-with-allergiene-cycle.product.100660040.html)

This bad boy is a washer/dryer combined into 1 utility. You throw your clothes into it, and a couple hours later, it's done. You don't have to worry about moving from the washer to the dryer.

Stacey mentioned there was an extension for smaller loads so that you can run 2 loads at the same time. TODO: Ask her where to find that upgrade. She got hers on sale for $1,300.

It is also Wi-Fi Enabled and compatible with Alexa and Google Assistant.
