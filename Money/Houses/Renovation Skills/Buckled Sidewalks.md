# Don't Buy In A Neighborhood With Buckled Sidewalks

My Grandpa didn't buy a house next to my Uncle because the sidewalks were buckled in that neighborhood, and on Oakmore Dr they were not. He said ==buckled sidewalks are an indicator that there will be foundation problems in the future==, and as it happened, Uncle Stu had foundation problems and my Grandpa never did. 

# What are buckled Sidewalks?

Buckled sidewalks refer to ==sidewalks that have become uneven or warped==, usually due to various factors such as tree roots, soil movement, temperature changes, or poor construction. When these factors cause the concrete or pavement to shift or rise, it can create ridges or bumps on the surface of the sidewalk, making it uneven and potentially hazardous for pedestrians.
