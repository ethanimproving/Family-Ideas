# Rekey A Kwikset Doorknob Handle Without Original Key

1. ![How to remove the lock cylinder from a Kwikset SmartKey entry knob](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFgdx5SDdC8)


1. **Gather Your Tools**:
    
    - A Kwikset rekeying kit: You can purchase these kits online or at a hardware store. They typically include a set of new keys, a key gauge, and tools.
    - A plug follower: This is a tool used to remove the lock cylinder from the door handle.
    - A small screwdriver or Allen wrench (hex key).
2. **Remove the Door Handle**:
    
    - Unscrew and remove the two screws on the interior side of the door handle.
    - Once the screws are removed, you can separate the two halves of the door handle.
3. **Remove the Lock Cylinder**:
    
    - Locate the retaining screw on the lock cylinder. It is usually on the edge of the door.
    - Use the small screwdriver or Allen wrench to remove this screw.
    - With the screw removed, the lock cylinder should be free to slide out of the door.
4. **Take Apart the Cylinder**:
    
    - Place the lock cylinder on a flat surface.
    - Use the plug follower to push the plug (the part with the keyholes) out of the cylinder.
    - You should now have access to the pins and springs inside the cylinder.
5. **Replace the Pins**:
    
    - Use the new pins provided in the rekeying kit.
    - Follow the instructions in the kit to arrange the pins in the correct order based on the new key that comes with the kit.
6. **Reassemble the Lock Cylinder**:
    
    - Once you've replaced the pins, carefully slide the plug back into the cylinder.
    - Make sure it is aligned correctly and slides smoothly.
7. **Reinstall the Lock Cylinder**:
    
    - Slide the lock cylinder back into the door, aligning it with the opening.
    - Reinsert the retaining screw and tighten it.
8. **Reassemble the Door Handle**:
    
    - Place the two halves of the door handle back together.
    - Reattach the screws on the interior side and tighten them.
9. **Test the New Key**:
    
    - Insert the new key provided in the rekeying kit into the lock and test it to ensure it works smoothly.

If you don't see a separate retaining screw on the lock cylinder, it's possible that the set screw is also serving as the retaining screw. In some lock designs, especially those used in residential door handles, a single screw can serve both purposes. Here's what you can do:

1. **Loosen the Set Screw**: Carefully use the appropriate tool (usually an Allen wrench or hex key) to loosen the set screw that is securing the lock cylinder to the door handle. Turn the screw counterclockwise to loosen it, but do not fully remove it just yet.

You can try contacting the manufacturer, Kwikset, directly to inquire about the availability of the set screw you need. You can reach them at 1-800-327-5625 1. I hope this helps!

Hello, I bought a Tustin Satin Nickel Exterior Entry Door Handle and Single Cylinder Deadbolt Combo Pack Featuring SmartKey Security at an auction. It came with the original keys, but unfortunately they must have already been rekeyed as the original keys don't unlock it. Is there a way I can rekey the handle without the original keys?
