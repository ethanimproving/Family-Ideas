Drawbacks of raising the floors include the problem of not knowing how much it will cost to raise the fireplace. That will not be cheap. The other concern is that the **post-tension point** in the living room will not be accessible if it is ever needed.

# What are post-tension points?

Post-tensioning is commonly used in structural engineering to increase the strength and durability of concrete elements. ==By applying tension to the tendons, it counteracts the tensile forces that can occur in concrete, making it more resistant to cracking and improving its load-bearing capacity==. This technique is often used in large-scale construction projects, such as bridges, parking garages, and high-rise buildings.
