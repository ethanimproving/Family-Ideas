# Map View

Nothing looks blatantly awful like some of the other locations. There's definitely some new houses over here. The house behind me is new. Maybe a young family with a baby that will be my daughter's Baptist husband. Who are we to resist the Lord's will?

It's have a nice view. We see the Town Home's back. They are much smaller than mine. Probably poor people will live there. But it's okay to be poor when you're starting out. They could still be hard working and ambitious and have a good mentality. It's important not to judge a book before reading it.
