# Map View

Well this one is a unit in a larger complex, which means less privacy. But I think that means I wouldn't have to mow the lawn. It has a community pool which is nice.

There are [cracks in the street](https://www.google.com/maps/@32.6959982,-96.9881054,3a,75y,218.61h,77.89t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sC68Y_9BnAcZ-XxAwe3nPJQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192!5m2!1e3!1e4?entry=ttu) nearby.

However [my actual street](https://www.google.com/maps/@32.6969496,-96.9891118,3a,24.9y,203.1h,88.31t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s9YurOdIZJ6TZtOGKf6yfsA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192!5m2!1e3!1e4?entry=ttu) would look nice.
