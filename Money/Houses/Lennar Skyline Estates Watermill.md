[Skyline Estates Watermill](https://www.lennar.com/new-homes/texas/dallas-ft-worth/hutchins/skyline-estates-watermill)  is a little far south to be an ideal living location, but it's not terrible. The price range of $271,999 - $316,999 is within my budget.

# Negations

- It is a 20 minute drive from civilization.
- It is a mid-distance drive to work and church.
- It is a long drive to home.

# Map View

It's right next to an auto parts company which I don't like.
