# Inspection

## Where To Get Inspected

At Kwik Kar on [901 S Westgate Way STE B, Wylie, TX 75098](https://goo.gl/maps/qAR9mGFHmNyEEjex8).

**Be sure to bring your updated Insurance Card.** Download it from the State Farm [Document Center](https://edocuments.statefarm.com/DocumentCenterUI/?year=0). You can also show them from your mobile phone via the app.

## We can’t confirm your vehicle inspection

If your vehicle passed inspection, bring the report to your [county tax office](https://txt.texas.gov/dmvrr/cant-confirm). You can renew your registration there.

You can only renew your registration once you pass an inspection.

After your inspection, renew:

- On [TxT](https://txt.texas.gov/dmvrr)
- By mail
- At your local Kroger
- Or at your county tax office

**Be sure to bring your Notice of Renewal**.

For help, call Texas Department of Motor Vehicles (TxDMV): [1-888-368-4689](tel: 18003684089)
