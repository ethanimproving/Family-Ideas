| Component | Description | Image |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Cylinder block | The main structure of the engine, housing the cylinders, crankshaft, and other components. | ![](https://www.howacarworks.com/images/130/undefined_w1400.jpg) |
| Cylinder head | Covers the top of the cylinders and contains the combustion chamber, spark plugs, and valves. | ![](https://frankensteined.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/LV3-Assem-Intake-2.png) |
| Pistons | Move up and down in the cylinders, compressing the air-fuel mixture and creating power. | ![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RV1xWCpBEr8/maxresdefault.jpg) |
| Connecting rods | Connect the pistons to the crankshaft, transferring the power from the pistons to the crankshaft. | ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Undefined_w1400.jpg) |
| Crankshaft | Converts the up-and-down motion of the pistons into rotational motion, which is then used to drive the wheels. | ![](https://autoprotoway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/components-of-crankshaft.jpg) |
| Camshaft | Opens and closes the valves at the right time to allow air and fuel into the cylinders and exhaust gases out. | ![](https://savree-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/Articles/optimised/Engine%20Crankshaft%20Parts.png) ![](https://www.matfoundrygroup.com/res/SOHC.gif) |
| Valves | Control the flow of air and fuel into and out of the cylinders. |  |
| Spark plugs | Ignite the air-fuel mixture in the cylinders. |  |
| Ignition system | Provides the spark to ignite the air-fuel mixture. |  |
| Fuel system | Delivers fuel to the engine. |  |
| Air intake system | Draws in air and delivers it to the engine. |  |
| Exhaust system | Removes exhaust gases from the engine. |  |
| Cooling system | Keeps the engine from overheating. |  |
| Lubrication system | Reduces friction between moving parts. |  |
