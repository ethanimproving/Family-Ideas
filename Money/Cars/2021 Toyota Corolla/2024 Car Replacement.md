This morning at 9:25 on my way to work, my [[Journal/Car Crash|car hydroplaned]] a couple of miles before my exit near Gateway church and spun out of control. It hit a wall and activated the airbags. The IntelliDrive app automatically called 911 and an officer arrived several minutes later.

Caleb was nice enough to drive me around Thursday evening, Friday evening, and all day Saturday. After messaging 28 listings on Facebook market place, seeing 6 cars all around DFW (one of them twice), making 4 offers, I finally ended up purchasing a [[2021 Toyota Corolla LE]] with some hail damage for $12,500 out the door, including TTL.

# 2013 Car Value

First of all I'd like to do an analysis on how much my 2013 car was worth. I paid $7,200 and drove 45,000 miles on it. Subtract the insurance amount I will receive, assuming $4,000 and that's $3,200.

$$$3,200 /42,000 miles = 7 cents / mile $$

I could adjust the volume and skip tracks from the steering wheel, which is now a must have for me.

## NADA Guides Valuation

According to NADA, my car is worth **$7,175-11,600**.
