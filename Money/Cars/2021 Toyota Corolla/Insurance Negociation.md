I don't know if you guys were on crack when coming up with that number, but it's so far below market value it's not even funny. NADA Guides valued my car between $7,175 and $11,000. 7K is the absolute minimum I should be getting. There's a 2013 Toyota Corolla sold for $7,500 with a salvage title. All the other listings are between 7K to 13K on [Facebook Marketplace](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/112379748776497/vehicles?maxYear=2013&minYear=2013&make=2318041991806363&model=647700429016304&exact=false). Mine was an S model with regular oil changes, good condition, clean title. These cars listed for 7K are salvage title. In what world are you going to give me less than that?

I should be asking for $9,000. $7,000 is the absolute minimum you could possibly settle for and me not file a complain with the state's insurance regulatory agency.

Insurance needs to be based on data, not whatever number you want to pull out of thin air.

I'll file a complaint with the state's **insurance regulatory agency** to do an investigation on your valuation metrics.


According to NADA, my car is worth **$7,175-11,600**.
