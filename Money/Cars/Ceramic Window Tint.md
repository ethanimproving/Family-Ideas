Ceramic window tint is known for its high performance in terms of heat rejection, UV protection, and glare reduction. However, it's important to clarify that no window tint can achieve 100% rejection of heat or UV rays. 

When you mention "99% keep rejecting," it's possible you're referring to a ceramic tint that claims to reject up to 99% of UV rays, which is indeed within the capabilities of high-quality ceramic tints. This means that the tint can significantly reduce the amount of UV radiation entering your vehicle or building, offering protection to both occupants and interiors.

Keep in mind that the heat rejection capabilities of ceramic tint can vary based on the specific product, brand, and the manufacturer's claims. While ceramic tints are generally effective at keeping out a significant amount of heat and UV rays, the actual performance may be influenced by factors such as the quality of installation, the type of glass, and the overall design of the vehicle or building.

If you're considering getting ceramic tint for your windows, it's a good idea to research different brands, read reviews, and consult with professionals to ensure you're getting a high-quality product that meets your needs.

# Ceramic window tint vs carbon window tint

Ceramic window tint and carbon window tint are both popular choices for improving the comfort, appearance, and performance of vehicle windows or windows in buildings. Let's explore the differences between them:

**Ceramic Window Tint:**

1. **Composition:** Ceramic window tint is made from ceramic particles that are non-metallic and non-conductive. These particles are embedded in a thin film, usually made from polyester.
    
2. **Heat Rejection:** Ceramic tints are known for their excellent heat rejection properties. They can block a significant amount of infrared heat while allowing visible light to pass through, resulting in reduced interior heat and glare.
    
3. **UV Protection:** Ceramic tints typically offer strong UV protection, helping to protect both the occupants of the vehicle or building and the interior materials from UV radiation.
    
4. **Clarity:** Ceramic tints maintain optical clarity and don't interfere with signals from electronic devices like cell phones, GPS, and radios.
    
5. **Durability:** They are durable and resist fading over time, even in harsh sunlight.
    

**Carbon Window Tint:**

1. **Composition:** Carbon window tint contains carbon particles that are embedded in a polyester film. These particles help enhance the film's performance.
    
2. **Heat Rejection:** Carbon tints provide good heat rejection, though they may not be as effective as ceramic tints in blocking heat.
    
3. **UV Protection:** Like ceramic tints, carbon tints offer good UV protection to prevent skin damage and interior fading.
    
4. **Appearance:** Carbon tints often have a matte, non-reflective finish that can enhance the appearance of the windows.
    
5. **Signal Interference:** Carbon tints generally don't interfere with electronic signals, similar to ceramic tints.
    

**Choosing Between Them:**

- **Performance:** If heat rejection and UV protection are your main concerns, ceramic tint might be the better choice due to its superior performance in these areas.
    
- **Cost:** Ceramic tints are usually more expensive than carbon tints due to their advanced technology and performance benefits.
    
- **Appearance:** Carbon tints can provide a stylish matte look, which some people prefer for aesthetic reasons.
    

Both ceramic and carbon tints offer benefits for enhancing comfort, reducing glare, and protecting against heat and UV radiation. Your choice should be based on your priorities and budget. It's recommended to consult with a professional window tint installer who can provide specific recommendations based on your needs and preferences.
