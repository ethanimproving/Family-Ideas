The Crosswind HP010 Plus 205/55R16 91H tire is a budget-oriented tire option. While it may offer an affordable price point, it's important to consider that **budget tires often have compromises in terms of performance and quality** compared to higher-end tire brands.

Currently I have *Bridgestone* DOT OBOF ECO 1019 Tires. The [DOT code](https://www.checktire.com/?lang=en) indicates the tire was made 4 years 3 months and 20 days ago in the United States on February 4th, 2019 at 3:46 PM.

# Free rotations

- Discount Tire rotates *any tires* for free.
- Walmart rotates tires *bought from them* for free.

# Warranty

- Discount Tire is **$25** per tire.
- Walmart is **$10** per tire.

Everyone in the Miller house buys the warranty except Caleb. If the warranty is $20 per tire, and one needs to be replaced, then you're saving about $20. But if 2 go out you're saving money.

The cost of the warranty can vary depending on the type of tire you buy and where you live, but typically, it can range from **$15 to $80 per tire**[1](https://bing.com/search?q=discount+tire+warranty+cost+per+tire). Other vehicles may have different tire insurance costs but expect to pay **15-18% of the tire price** for the extra coverage[2](https://www.fixdapp.com/auto-warranty/discount-tire-insurance-everything-to-know/).

# Should I replace the wheel too?

1. Wheel Condition: Inspect your wheels for any signs of damage, such as **cracks, bends, or corrosion**. If your wheels are in good condition and meet the specifications for your vehicle, there may be no need to replace them.
    
2. Compatibility: Consider **whether your current wheels are compatible with the new tires** you plan to purchase. Check the recommended tire size and load rating for your vehicle, and ensure that your wheels can accommodate them. If your wheels are not compatible, you may need to replace them.

# When to buy?

When go in to buy, **ask them if there will be any July 4 sales**.
