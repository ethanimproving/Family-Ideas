The best time to buy a car is when it's about 8 years old. The purchase value goes down in a logarithm the most quickly when it's new. It usually has 2/3 of it's life left after the purchase price depreciates 70%.

So you could buy a new 2021 Corolla for 25K, or a 2013 Corolla for 7K like I did. #math

If it's my car, I will buy it when it's 6-8 years old, because ~70% of the purchase value depreciation occurs in the first 1/3 of a car's lifespan.

The national average for mileage is 15,000 miles a year. Multiply by 7 years, you get 105,000 miles.

Discover how many miles per gallon you can drive, and budget the corresponding depreciation of your car to a new car. I.e 50 cents per mile driven based on gas purchased.

Believe it or not, a lot of vehicles donâ€™t last that long. Only [1% of vehicles](https://kiss951.com/2022/08/15/these-vehicles-are-the-most-likely-to-reach-over-300k-miles/) make it past the 200,000 mile mark. Just .03% of cars roll over the 300,000 mile mark, which is pretty incredible.
