Buying a used car can be exciting, but it's important to be thorough and informed to avoid any unpleasant surprises down the road. Here are some key things to check when used car shopping:

# Before you see the car:

- **Research the model:** Read reviews, compare prices, and check for common problems associated with the specific make and model you're interested in.
- **Set a budget:** Factor in your purchase price, potential repairs, insurance, and running costs.
- **Get pre-approved for a loan:** This will give you bargaining power and ensure you can afford the car before you fall in love with it.
- **Run the VIN** to review the vehicle's history through a service like [CARFAX](https://www.carfax.com/) or [Kelley Blue Book](https://www.kbb.com/).

# Inspecting the car:

## Exterior:

- **Look for:** Dents, scratches, rust, uneven panel gaps, mismatched paint, and signs of water damage.
- **Check:** Tires for wear and tear, proper inflation, and any damage to the wheels.
- **Open and close:** Doors, hood, and trunk to ensure they work smoothly.

## Interior:

- **Smell for:** Musty odors that could indicate water damage.
- **Check:** Seats, carpets, and upholstery for wear and tear.
- **Test:** All features and controls, including lights, radio, air conditioning, and windows.

## Under the hood:

- **Look for:** Leaks, fluid drips, and any obvious signs of damage.
- **Ask for:** Maintenance records and service history.

## During the test drive:

- **Pay attention to:** Engine noises, vibration, steering feel, braking response, and acceleration.
- **Drive on:** Different types of roads to get a feel for the car's handling.
- **Ask questions:** About any concerns you have.

## Additional checks:

- **Get a vehicle history report:** This will reveal any accidents, title issues, or odometer rollbacks.
- **Have the car inspected by a trusted mechanic:** This is especially important for older cars.
- **Negotiate the price:** Don't be afraid to bargain based on the condition of the car and your research.

## Remember:

- **Trust your gut:** If something seems off, walk away.
- **Don't rush:** Take your time to find the right car for you.
- **Get everything in writing:** This includes the purchase price, agreed-upon repairs, and warranty details.

By following these tips and doing your due diligence, you can increase your chances of finding a reliable and affordable used car that you'll love for years to come.
