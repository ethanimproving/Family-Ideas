# Recommendation:

If you prioritize a perfect fit and guaranteed quality, go for the OE tail light assembly. If you're on a budget and open to aftermarket options, consider researching reputable brands and reading reviews before buying. Replacing the bulb is the most affordable option but only applicable if only the bulb is malfunctioning.

Remember, safety is crucial. Ensure the replacement part meets all legal requirements and functions properly before driving your car.
