Since you already know the exact color (1F7 Classic Silver Metallic) for your car, here are some recommendations for fixing the rust spot and repainting it:

**Preparation:**

1. **Clean the area thoroughly:** Remove any dirt, debris, and wax around the rust spot using a cleaning agent like dish soap and water.
2. **Sand the rust:** Use fine-grit sandpaper (around 220-400 grit) to remove the rust completely. Sand until the bare metal is smooth and even.
3. **Apply rust converter:** Use a rust converter to chemically treat the area and prevent further rusting. Follow the instructions on the product carefully.
4. **Mask surrounding areas:** Use masking tape and paper to protect surrounding areas from paint overspray.

**Paint Products:**

- **Touch-up pen:** If the rust spot is very small, a high-quality touch-up pen specifically designed for your car's color (1F7 Classic Silver Metallic) might be sufficient. This is the easiest option for beginners.
- **Touch-up paint kit:** For larger areas, a touch-up paint kit containing primer, base coat, and clear coat is recommended. This provides better coverage and durability than a pen.
- **Aerosol spray paint:** For even larger areas or for those seeking a more professional finish, an aerosol spray paint can be used. Choose a reputable brand and ensure it's specifically designed for automotive use and color-matched to 1F7 Classic Silver Metallic.

**Application:**

- **Apply primer (if using a kit or spray paint):** A primer helps the paint adhere better to the metal and prevents rust.
- **Apply base coat:** Apply thin coats of the base coat until you achieve full coverage. Allow each coat to dry completely before applying the next.
- **Apply clear coat (if using a kit or spray paint):** The clear coat protects the paint and provides a glossy finish. Apply thin coats of clear coat, allowing drying time between each.

**Additional Tips:**

- **Work in a well-ventilated area and wear gloves and protective eyewear.**
- **Follow the instructions on the paint products carefully.**
- **Apply thin coats of paint and allow sufficient drying time between coats.**
- **For best results, consider practicing on a scrap piece of metal before painting your car.**
- If you're unsure about any part of the process, it's always best to consult a professional body shop for help.

By following these steps and recommendations, you should be able to successfully fix the rust spot and repaint your car to match the original 1F7 Classic Silver Metallic color.
