Negotiating the price of a car can be a daunting task, but with the right preparation and tactics, you can walk away with a great deal. Here are some tips and phrases you can use to become a confident and successful negotiator:

**Before you head to the dealership:**

- **Do your research:** Know the fair market value of the car you're interested in. Resources like Kelley Blue Book, Edmunds, and Consumer Reports can provide you with valuable data.
- **Get pre-approved for financing:** This gives you leverage in negotiations and avoids relying on the dealership's financing options.
- **Set a budget and stick to it:** Don't get swept away by the excitement and overspend.
- **Consider all costs:** Factor in not just the purchase price but also insurance, registration, taxes, and maintenance.
- **Be prepared to walk away:** If you don't get a deal you're happy with, be willing to walk away from the negotiation.

**During negotiations:**

- Be polite and respectful: Even if you're feeling frustrated, maintain a professional demeanor.
- **Start low:** Make an initial offer that's well below the asking price, but within a reasonable range.
- **Use silence:** Don't be afraid to pause and let the salesperson fill the silence. ==They may be more likely to make concessions if they think you're about to walk away==.
- **Be prepared to counter:** The salesperson will likely counter your offer. Be prepared to counter back with a number closer to your target price.
- Focus on the total cost: Don't just get hung up on the sticker price. Negotiate for a lower price, higher trade-in value, or free add-ons to get the best overall deal.
- Use leverage: If you have pre-approved financing or are considering buying multiple cars, let the salesperson know. This can give you more bargaining power.

**Here are some specific phrases you can use:**

- "I'm interested in this car, but I'm not sure I can afford the asking price."
- "**I've seen this car listed** for [lower price] at another dealership."
- "I'm willing to pay [your offer price] in cash today."
- "I'm willing to pay $11,000 cash out the door tomorrow."
- "Can you throw in [free add-on] if I buy the car today?"
- "I need to think about it. Can I get your contact information?"

**Remember:**

- Be patient and persistent. Negotiations can take time.
- Don't be afraid to ask questions. The more informed you are, the better you can negotiate.
- Trust your gut. If you don't feel comfortable with the deal, walk away.

By following these tips and using these phrases, you can increase your chances of getting a great deal on your next car.

**Bonus tip:** Practice your negotiation skills before you head to the dealership. Role-play with a friend or family member to get comfortable with the back-and-forth of negotiation.
