#### Probablity of being affected

The probability of *not* being affected by a tornado in a given year is the complement of the probability of *being* affected. If the probability of being affected by a tornado is 0.1% to 0.5% per year, the probability of *not* being affected (P(notÂ affected)) is `100%âˆ’P(affected)`. You can then use this probability to calculate the likelihood of not being affected over a certain number of years.

The formula for calculating the probability of not being affected over n years is given by the formula:

$$P(not affected in n years)=(P(not affected)) 
n$$

For example, if you want to know the probability of not being affected by a tornado over 10 years::

$$P(notÂ affectedÂ inÂ 10Â years)=(0.995)10$$

This formula gives you the probability of not being affected over a specific period based on the annual probability of being affected. When we do the [calculations](https://mysite.aa.com/:x:/g/personal/242924_corpaa_aa_com/EfcsgMGWGblOpMCeDHqxj4wBns6HlpK_47iUZQs-0r6nwQ?e=w93acd) according to the given annual probability, it would be 277 years before there is a 50% chance of me being affected.

##### Insurance Company Breaks Even

The policy covers up to $40,500 at $136 per year. It would be only 297 years before I paid them amount that they cover, and 277 years before I would actually need them to cover it.

$$NumberÂ ofÂ Years=AnnualÂ Premium/MaximumÂ CoverageÂ Amountâ€‹$$

That is also the number of people who need to purchase this coverage for the insurance company to afford replacing a single roof. That means the insurance company is collecting enough money each year to cover 0.3% of the total people buying into the program, which correlates to the number of people who experience these events in Table 1.1.

##### Coverage Contribution Analysis

However, given I will live another 60 years, there is an 86% chance I will not experience one of these events, and a 100% chance I will lose $8,000 paying for that coverage, which is 20% of the coverage anyway. Which means I am buying a 14% protection for a 20% premium, leaving odds in the favor of the house by 6%. Another way of saying it is ==I've paid 20% of the total coverage for a 14% chance that I'll use it==. That's a bad Coverage Contribution Rate (CCR). They may as well call themselves a Casino.

## Limited Seepage or Leakage of water Endorsement ðŸ‘Ž

A "limited seepage or leakage of water endorsement" in a homeowners insurance policy likely refers to an additional coverage option that provides protection for certain types of water damage, specifically those related to seepage or slow leaks. This endorsement may be designed to offer coverage for water damage that occurs gradually over time, which is typically excluded from standard homeowners insurance policies.

## Home Security Protection ðŸ‘Ž

Umm no? I have security cameras and police.

## Service Line Coverage ðŸ‘Ž

Provides protection for damage to underground service lines on your property. These service lines typically include essential utility lines that connect your home to public utility systems, such as water lines, sewer lines, gas lines, electrical lines, and communication cables.

Service Line Coverage typically protects against a range of perils, including wear and tear, corrosion, rust, decay, **freezing**, mechanical breakdown, and other similar issues that may cause damage to service lines.
