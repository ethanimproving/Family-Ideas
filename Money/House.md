# Balloon Payment

Carol's mom is the bank, getting the interest. She got $975 a month on the interest. For 5 years. They might give you a point or 2 below the going interest rate. They stand to make a lot more money on the house.

A $200,000, for 5 years I'm paying it down at the rate we agree on, so that at the end of 5 years, I will take out a smaller loan to pay them. If they give me a great deal on the house or a great interest rate they stand to make more money on the house. Ask them what they're looking at.

Look at an amortization chart.

- Old builds are mote sturdy than new builds.
- If someone's renting an destroyed it, you're going to redo it anyway.

#### Paint Brick

1.  Paint: Depending on the type of paint you choose and the number of coats needed, you can expect to spend between $100 and $300 for paint.
    
2.  Equipment: You will need to rent or purchase a sprayer, which can cost anywhere from $50 to $200 per day. You will also need brushes, rollers, tarps, and other supplies, which can add up to around $100 to $200.
    
3.  Preparation: You will need to pressure wash the brick to remove dirt and grime, and possibly repair any cracks or damage. This will require equipment rental and materials, which can cost around $100 to $300.
    
4.  Total cost: Taking all of these factors into account, the total cost to paint the outside brick of a 1700 square foot house can range from $350 to $1000.

However, it's important to note that painting brick can be tricky, and if it's not done properly, it can cause problems such as peeling, chipping, and water damage. It may be worth considering hiring a professional painter to ensure that the job is done correctly and the results are long-lasting.

#### Rebrick the house

The cost to rebrick a 1700 square foot house will depend on various factors such as the type of bricks used, labor costs, and any additional work that needs to be done.

Assuming a cost of around $6 to $12 per square foot for brick materials and an average labor cost of around $30 to $60 per hour, the cost to rebrick a 1700 square foot house could range from $10,200 to $20,400 for materials and labor alone.

However, it's important to note that this is just an estimate, and the actual cost could be higher or lower depending on the specifics of the project. Other factors that could impact the cost include the complexity of the project, the need for any additional work like demolition or structural repairs, and the availability and cost of materials and labor in your area. It's best to get a few quotes from professional bricklayers to get a more accurate estimate for your specific project.

# Interest Rate

One reputable resource you can use to find the average interest rate in Texas with a [[Credit Score|credit score of 750]] is [Bankrate.com](https://www.bankrate.com/). Bankrate is a trusted source for financial information and offers various tools and resources, including a loan rate estimator. You can input your loan amount, term, credit score, and location to see average interest rates for different types of loans, such as auto loans, personal loans, and mortgages.

Another resource you can use is [NerdWallet.com](https://www.nerdwallet.com/). NerdWallet is a personal finance website that offers comprehensive information on loans and credit scores. They have a loan calculator that can help you estimate the interest rate on different types of loans based on your credit score and location.

It's worth noting that interest rates can vary widely based on many factors, so the rates you find on these websites should be used as a general guide and not as a definitive quote. It's always a good idea to shop around and compare rates from multiple lenders to ensure you're getting the best deal possible.

# Nuanced Analysis

## How does debt negatively affect my quality of life?

Paying $350,000 with a loan vs $200,000 with cash is just one way of thinking about the issue. You have to be more nuanced than that. If I don't have any money, and it's $5 for a sandwich, would I rather pay $5 for the sandwich tomorrow and just go without food today, or would I rather pay $10 for a sandwich 7 days from now, but I get to eat it today? The question about house loans becomes, "How does the debt negatively affect my quality of life, and how does the house positive effect my quality of life?" You weigh it in the balance. Maybe I have to save $5,000 a month for 5 years in order to pay cash for the house, and I have to wait 5 years to get married. Or what would monthly payment be across 30 years if there was zero interest? And how much more is it with interest? That number is how debt negatively impacts you. Maybe it's only a difference of $300. What can you do with $300? And if $300 extra a month improves your life to a far enough extent, it only takes a $3600 raise (after taxes) to offset the loan's negative effect on your life. So instead of stressing out about finding the perfect deal on a house, buy the one you want, get a loan, stop waiting for a bigger down payment, and focus on improving your specialized skillset to increase the value of your labor hour so that you eliminate the loan's negative effect on your quality of life.

$$$2005 - $1223 = $782$$
The negative effect of a loan on my life is <mark class="hltr-yellow">$782</mark> every month. Assuming I only take 70% of my income home, I would need a <mark class="hltr-yellow">$13,402 raise</mark> to offset the negative effect of the interest on my life. This may change in my favor if I'm able to refinance lower. Also bear in mind homes go up in value, so by waiting you may lose out on potential gains, and that appreciation can also offset the interest.

$$($782/month * 12 months) * 70\% = $13,402$$

Don't be worried about the exorbitant interest the banks are charging. Even if the year of Jubilee doesn't happen, God will redistribute the the wealth to someone who cares about the poor.

> 8. He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor.
