# Balloon Payment

Carol's mom is the bank, getting the interest. She got $975 a month on the interest. For 5 years. They might give you a point or 2 below the going interest rate. They stand to make a lot more money on the house.

A $200,000, for 5 years I'm paying it down at the rate we agree on, so that at the end of 5 years, I will take out a smaller loan to pay them. If they give me a great deal on the house or a great interest rate they stand to make more money on the house. Ask them what they're looking at.

Look at an amortization chart.

- Old builds are mote sturdy than new builds.
- If someone's renting an destroyed it, you're going to redo it anyway.

Don't be worries about the exorbitant interest the banks are charging. Even if the year of Jubilee doesn't happen, God will redistribute the the wealth to someone who cares about the poor.
> [!Bible] [Proverbs 28:8 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Proverbs+28:8?translation=kjv)
> 8. He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor.
