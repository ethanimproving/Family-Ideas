# Advice

1. The only type of loan you are interested in is a conventional fixed rate mortgage.
2. Get them to quote you different time periods (30, 20, 15 year). I regret not getting them to quote me 20 year.
3. Have an idea of sale price, how much you are putting down.
4. Make sure there is no prepayment penalty.
5. If you can avoid having an escrow, do it even if there is a small fee.

Sometimes you may be asked for verification on employment. You can give them someone from your HR department for that.

## What Is An Escrow?

An escrow is a financial arrangement that involves a neutral third party, typically an escrow agent or a title company, holding funds or assets on behalf of two or more parties involved in a transaction. The purpose of escrow is to provide security and ensure that the terms and conditions of the transaction are met before the funds or assets are released.

Dave Ramsey, a well-known personal finance expert, ==does not advocate for escrow accounts for property taxes and insurance when it comes to buying a primary home==. His philosophy is rooted in the belief that ==individuals should take personal responsibility for managing their finances and expenses==.

Dave Ramsey recommends that homeowners save and budget for property taxes and insurance on their own, rather than relying on an escrow account. He suggests setting up a separate savings account and regularly setting aside funds to cover these expenses when they become due. By doing so, ==homeowners have more control over their money and can earn interest on their savings==.

Ramsey's perspective is that ==escrow accounts can sometimes lead to complacency in budgeting and financial planning==. He encourages homeowners to proactively manage their finances and take an active role in saving for future expenses.
