# Historical Schedule

Last year (in 2019) used Roundup concentrate 35.2 oz. [Home Depot $22.97+] 11/10/2019 after Bermuda was dormant but some weeds (specifically dallisgrass) were still green. Beware this kills anything growing including grass.													
This year (2020) also used a reel mower which may be healthier for the grass. Scissor type cut opposed to ripping it from the traditional rotary style. Works good under certain conditions. Difficult under others. If grass or weeds are too tall does not work well. Have heard should not cut more than 1/3 of the grass blade. During peak growth was cutting twice a week this summer (mainly due to reel mower being difficult going a full week).
