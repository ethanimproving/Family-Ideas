# Application Process

To ensure that you spray the right amount over your lawn, Caleb recommends chunking your application into 1000 square feet segments. **1 Gallon of Spray Mix covers 1,000 Sq Ft**. My [[7322 Oakmore Lawn|yard]] is split up into roughly two 1,500 Sq Ft segments of different grass, so I will apply 1.5 gallons at a time.


| Yard Segment            | Area Sq Ft | Spray Mix |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Front (Warm-season)     | 1558.04    | 8.1g      |
| Side/Back (Cool-season) | 1671.73    | 8.7g      |

Using a [[Title 8 - Nutrition#§§ (a) Calorie Deficit|kitchen scale]], measure the amount of spray mix that corresponds with your application. Then mix it with water (1 Gallon per 1000 Sq Ft). Dump it into your backpack sprayer and begin the application.

# Application Information
- For cool and warm-season lawns, our recommendation is **2 applications in the spring** if your target is crabgrass. Check out our [FREE Pre-Emergent Guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RltE1agvtLT62Ad6Qdgn5pkMrGENBX8E/view) for specific details.
- The best time to apply Prodiamine is in the spring or fall, as **soil temperatures are between 55F to 70F**. This will give you approximately 3 months of pre-emergence protection.   Download our [FREE app](https://yardmastery.com/pages/yard-mastery-app-download) it will tell you exactly when your soil temps cross these milestones.

DO NOT use Prodiamine if you are seeding or reseeding, as it will keep your seed from germinating.

Prodiamine 65 WDG should be applied via a battery-powered sprayer. We do NOT recommend applying via a hose-end sprayer.

We recommend weighing this product on a scale to be accurate, and grams will be the easiest. See the following table for the application rates we recommend. The product must be watered in within 48 hours; the sooner the better. ½” of water from irrigation or rainfall.

**IMPORTANT**: All pre-emergent applications need to be watered into work. Get them watered in within 48 hours of application if you can. The sun can degrade the chemical so get it watered in ASAP.
