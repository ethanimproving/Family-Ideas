# Loan With Flooring

![[2023-12-15#Hypothetical Condition]]

## Revision Request

On 12/14/2023 the appraiser received the following revision request from the client/lender:

1. *Report needs to be subject to the flooring*

**Hypothetical Condition: Flooring:**

As noted above, there are many ongoing repair projects present within the subject property as of the effective date. The process
of replacing the interior carpeting is one of these projects, and the effect on market value of all these ongoing projects, as part of
the overall condition of the property, has been considered as a whole.

The absence of carpeting is relevant for lender conditions in this case. Therefore, as ==part of the Scope of Work==, this report is
made Subject To repairs/alterations, per the following Hypothetical Condition:

The appraiser is taking the Hypothetical Condition that new carpeting has been installed over the concrete floors within the
subject property.

The use of this Hypothetical Condition may have affected the assignment results. If this condition is not met, it may alter the
opinions and conclusions expressed in this report.

# Ask the Appraiser to Estimate Actual Value

He's already been there and he made a mistake giving hypothetical value. Ask him to give actual value.

# We said this sale was "As Is" from the beginning

If the appraiser gave a hypothetical condition while on page 13 also stating, "==the opinion of value described in this report is for the subject property in its current, "As-Is" condition==." 

# The Scope of Work is not sensible

Putting the flooring in before retexturing walls puts the flooring in danger of being damaged, dusty, etc. It's not reasonable to ask the buyer to install flooring before such expenditures.

# Let me look for other options

Let me reach out to some other lenders, SoFi had some very nice benefits and offer a lower interest rate with 0 points and a $1,500 fee, which ends up being only $250 less expensive anyway.

I see your appraisal is pending the installation of floors. Let your lender know that you are buying as is, renovating, and the floors should be the last thing to go in after your other renovations so the floor does not get damaged. If he is not satisfied with that let him know to take a hike. Ann says she has never seen an appraisal depend on flooring. We went with Texas Bank, a local lender to get our loan I can give you their information if you need it.

- I've never seen an appraisal depend on flooring.
- My appraisal should be acceptable to another bank.
- Will I still pay the $250 processing fee?

The bank just needs to know that the value of the house is greater than the value of the loan. So the value with floors is $250k, a reasonable person would subtract the amount you would pay for flooring, let's say $5k, and say its value without floors is $245k.

## Hypothetical Condition Is Not My Fault

The appraiser they hired gave a hypothetical condition. ==That has nothing to do with me.== If that's not acceptable to the bank you should have instructed your appraiser not to give such estimates. Therefore I would suggest the bank can either accept the hypothetical condition or it is responsible to pay for the next inspection.

Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac guidelines require there to be flooring. If it was torn up we could make it work.

# Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac

You're correct that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac do have requirements for flooring in properties financed with their loans. However, they don't explicitly state that flooring **must be present** in every case. Instead, their focus is on the overall functional condition and habitability of the property.

Here's a breakdown of where you can find relevant information about these guidelines:

**Freddie Mac:**

- **Single-Family Seller/Servicer Guide:** This guide, specifically [Section 5605.5](https://guide.freddiemac.com/app/guide/section/5605.5), discusses property condition ratings and acceptable levels of wear and tear. While it doesn't directly address missing flooring, it does state that properties must be "adequate security" for the loan, implying functional living conditions.
- **Appraisal Report and Property Eligibility FAQ:** This [FAQ section](https://sf.freddiemac.com/faqs/appraisal-report-faq) offers further clarification on property condition requirements for appraisal reports. Again, the emphasis is on functionality and livability, not necessarily the presence of every finish like flooring.

**Fannie Mae:**

- **Single-Family Selling Guide:** Similar to Freddie Mac's guide, this document outlines property eligibility requirements in [Section B4-1.4.3](https://selling-guide.fanniemae.com/Selling-Guide/Origination-through-Closing/Subpart-B4-Underwriting-Property/Chapter-B4-1-Property-Assessment-and-Valuation/Section-B4-1-4-Special-Appraisal-and-Other-Valuation/1032992341/B4-1-4-03-Condo-Appraisal-Requirements-04-15-2014.htm), focusing on livability and marketability. Again, missing flooring isn't explicitly addressed, but the requirement for "basic livability" suggests its importance.
- **Property Standards:** This webpage provides an overview of Fannie Mae's property eligibility standards, highlighting the importance of "sound structural condition" and "adequate utilities." While not directly mentioning flooring, these factors indirectly imply its necessity for a habitable dwelling.
- **Appraisal Report Forms and Exhibits**: [Section B4-1.2-05](https://selling-guide.fanniemae.com/Selling-Guide/Origination-through-Closing/Subpart-B2-Eligibility/) does mention that in general, improvements, alterations, and repairs on the subject property must be complete when the mortgage is sold to Fannie Mae.



**B4-1.2-05, Requirements for Verifying Completion and Postponed Improvements (03/01/2023)**

**Additional Resources:**

- **Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP):** While not specific to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, USPAP sets ethical and professional standards for appraisers, including the requirement to report on property conditions that affect marketability and habitability. Missing flooring would likely fall under this category.

**Important Note:**

It's crucial to remember that even though Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guidelines don't explicitly require flooring in every case, individual lenders may have stricter requirements. Additionally, appraisers have significant discretion in assessing property condition and ultimately may deem a property with missing flooring ineligible for certain loan programs.

Therefore, your statement that "if it was torn up we could make it work" might not be accurate in all situations. Depending on the extent of the missing flooring, the overall condition of the property, and the specific lender's guidelines, it could potentially pose challenges for loan approval.

The best course of action would be to consult with a qualified mortgage professional or real estate agent to understand the specific requirements for your situation and the potential feasibility of obtaining a loan for a property with missing flooring.

I hope this information helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

I trust this email finds you well. I am writing to provide certification regarding my capability to install flooring myself for the home improvement project associated with my loan application.

I have previously undertaken flooring installation projects, demonstrating proficiency in executing such tasks. I understand the importance of ensuring that the work is completed to high standards, and I am confident in my ability to achieve satisfactory results.

In order to assist in assessing the financial aspect of the project, I have attached a detailed estimate for the required luxury vinyl flooring supplies. The estimate is sourced from Home Depot, and it includes a breakdown of costs for your reference. Please find the attached Luxury Vinyl Cart document.

I am committed to managing the project responsibly and ensuring that the allocated loan funds are used judiciously. Should you require any additional information or have further inquiries, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I appreciate your ongoing support throughout the loan application process.
