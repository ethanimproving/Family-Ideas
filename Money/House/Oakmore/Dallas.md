There are a lot of [sex offenders](https://www.propertyiq.com/tx/dallas/oakmore-drive/75249-piq4240195) in the area. They are almost all black people with a charge of "Sexual Assault of a Child." Each dot marks a person that the government should have put to death. You shouldn't be able to molest a child and still live. This is not justice.

It takes awhile to navigate to the right place. You will want to land right about here. In the layer list, check `Dallas Tax Parcels`, `Zoning Grid`, `BI Office Boundries`, `BI Districts`, `Base Zoning`, `Council Districts`, `Census Tracts`, and `City limits`. I like the Topographic and the OpenStreetMap Basemap the best.

# The Woods Section 11

> [!bible] [John 15:11 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/John+15:11?translation=kjv)
> 11. These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.

The theme of my new neighborhood is "The Woods." I can imagine a design for this theme as a green computer chip digital background where the circuits are tree vines, references John 15 when Jesus said, "I am the vine, you are the branches." The Focus of New Port Harbor (where I grew up) was soul-winning. "Cast your nets into the sea. Now follow me and I will make you a fisher of men." But the focus of my new neighborhood will be to abide in Christ. This will achieve the same result, because Jesus said he that abides in me, he it is that bears much fruit. Whether I'm casting a net into the sea and winning people for Christ, or reproducing my faith in other's by abiding in Jesus, the focus may shift but the outcome remains set. We win more souls to Jesus when we commune with him. That's what this neighborhood is about. Let's go out to the woods to abide with Jesus. Bring your Bible and your journal, and let's get on our knees before the King and draw close to him. We need this in the Woods.
