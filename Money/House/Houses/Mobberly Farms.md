# Summary

It is North of Frisco, ==way too far== from church and work. I do like the culture of white people and Asians though. Very successful, clean, organized, Christian, hard-working. Unlike black neighborhoods that have litter everywhere, un-mowed lawns full of weeds, graffiti, cracks in the roads, and pants hanging low.
