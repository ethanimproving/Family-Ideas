It's close to a middle school, which is kind of a disappointment compared to being next to a college, but if my kids go to public school it will be nice to live nearby in case I have to talk to the principal a lot. There is a 6 lane road right in front of me, but the house is far enough from it that the noise probably won't affect me. It's close to a bus stop. That would be nice in case my car dies and I get stranded here. We could just take the bus to the places we need to go.
