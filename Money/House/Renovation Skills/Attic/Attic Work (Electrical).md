# Electricity

[Volts, Amps, & Watts Explained!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=PyLjnVJVM1s)

## Watts

The wattage is the amount of electricity being used. You can think of it as the number of electrons required to perform a task.

Watts represent the rate at which electrical energy is consumed or produced in a circuit. It is the product of voltage (in volts) and current (in amperes) and is used to measure the power of an electrical device. In simple terms, watts tell you how much energy a device uses or produces per unit of time.

$$P(Watts)=V(Volts)×I(Amperes)$$
## Amps

Amperes, often referred to as "amps," measure the **rate of flow of electric current** in a circuit. It quantifies **how many electrons pass through a given point in a conductor per unit of time**. Amperes are analogous to the flow rate of water in a pipe. 

Amps is the force of the electricity. Typical boxes have 15 amps and 20 amps.

Divide 60 + 60 + 60 + 60 watts (240 watts) by 120 volts, and you end up with 2 amps. However if you look closer each bulb only uses 8.5 watts. So 8.5 x 4 = 34 watts / 120 volts = 0.28 amps. Only 1.8% of the capacity of that breaker. 

## Volts

Volts represent the electrical potential difference or voltage between two points in an electrical circuit. In simpler terms, it's the **force that pushes electrons through a conductor** (like a wire). Voltage is analogous to the pressure in a water pipe. Common household electrical outlets provide voltage at 120 and 240 volts.

Volts are Amps x Watts. You can think of it as the number of electrons in a particular space. Like water pressure. You could have 20,000 volts but if your amps are low enough you won't get electricuted.

## Transformer

City Transformers take huge amounts of volts and convert them to amps to make it usable to households.

# Service mast

This is a service mast. It connects an electrical service to a building.

![](https://www.familyhandyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/mast.jpg)



My house doesn't have a service mast because it's serviced underground. Instead of feeding wire through a service mast, I will use the gap between the roof and the ceiling. It's safer to have underground service.

# Tips From John Ball

Be sure to run 14 3.  This is a black, red, white, and ground.

You will need 2 people, cordless drill with at least 3/4 that is at least 10 inches long,  pulling tape,  pan cake box.  Get the larger one. Rome nails. If you're going to add a switch, you'll need a two gang pop-in box, wire stripper, wire nuts, sheet rock saw.

My breaker box has 2 service slots available.

## Transformer

![](https://www.dfliq.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/electrical-transformer.gif)

A transformer is an electrical device that transfers electrical energy between two or more circuits through electromagnetic induction. Its main function is to change the voltage level of an alternating current (AC) electrical supply, either increasing it (step-up transformer) or decreasing it (step-down transformer).

In the context you mentioned, where your electrician friend said you have a transformer across the street that services electricity underground, it's likely that they're referring to a distribution transformer. These transformers are commonly used in electrical distribution systems to provide power to homes, buildings, and various facilities.

Here's how a distribution transformer works:

1. **Voltage Conversion:** The primary winding of the transformer receives the higher voltage from the power lines. This higher voltage is typically used for long-distance transmission.
    
2. **Step-Down:** The secondary winding of the transformer provides a lower voltage suitable for local distribution to homes and businesses.
    
3. **Safety and Isolation:** Distribution transformers also provide isolation between the primary high-voltage side and the secondary low-voltage side, improving safety and preventing voltage fluctuations.
    
4. **Underground Service:** In some cases, transformers are located in substations or utility vaults across the street from residential areas. These transformers convert the high-voltage power from the utility lines to a lower voltage for safe distribution to homes and buildings.
    

Transformers play a critical role in electrical power systems, ensuring that the electricity supplied to homes and businesses is at the appropriate voltage levels for safe and efficient use.

## Magnets for Fishing Tape

When running fishing tape down the wall, it can be a challenge getting it into the back of the box. Consider using a [strong magnet](https://www.amazon.com/MagnetPal-Heavy-Duty-Neodymium-Anti-Rust-Retrieval/dp/B07BYWD99S/ref=sxbs_sbv_search_btf) for this.

## Wire Staples

For anyone curious, you would use an S1 staple for a 14/2 or 14/3 cable, and an S2 staple for two 14/2 cables.

## Proper Cable Support

Cables should be supported and secured to prevent sagging or damage. Here's how to do it:
    
### Along Joists

Run cables along the top of attic joists, keeping them at least 1.25 inches below the top surface or protected by a running board. This helps prevent damage during future attic work or storage.
        
### Across Joists

If you need to cross joists, drill holes through the center of the joists and pass the cable through. Do not staple cables to the sides of joists or run them across the top without protection.
