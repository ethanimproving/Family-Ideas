# Cable Type

Use electrical cables that are suitable for the intended use, such as NM (Non-Metallic Sheathed) cable for general residential wiring or other types as required by code for specific applications.

# Proper Cable Support

Cables should be supported and secured to prevent sagging or damage. Here's how to do it:
## Along Joists

Run cables along the **top of attic joists**, keeping them at least 1.25 inches below the top surface or protected by a running board. This helps prevent damage during future attic work or storage.
    
## Across Joists

If you need to cross joists, **drill holes through the center of the joists** and pass the cable through. ==Do not staple cables to the sides of joists== or run them across the top without protection. As for boring holes. I would almost always ==stay away from this in attics==. There is no use in possibly hurting the integrity of your structure to run electric.

You should not run electrical cables across collar ties or on the ground in the attic. Running electrical cables across collar ties can **obstruct access to the attic** and may interfere with their structural integrity.

There is nothing wrong with running your electric on top of joists but you really should try to do it in areas that aren't going to be exposed to any foot traffic. If you need to go parallel then simply run them a few inches down on the side of a joist.

## Cable Management

### Don't Run Wire On The Ground

To avoid people stepping on wires, the less wire on the ground the better. However you also don't want to obstruct access to your attic so try to be sensible where you run wire.

### Article 320 Armored Cable: Type AC

https://up.codes/s/armored-cable-type-ac

**320.23 In Accessible Attics.** Type AC cables in accessible attics or roof spaces shall be installed as specified in 320.23(A) and (B).

**(A) Where Run Across the Top of Floor Joists.** Where run *across the top of floor joists*, or within 2.1 m (7 ft) of floor *or floor joists across the face of rafters* or studding, in attics and roof spaces that are accessible, ==the cable shall be protected by substantial guard strips that are at least as high as the cable==. Where this space is not accessible by permanent stairs or ladders, protection shall only be required within 1.8 m (6 ft) of the nearest edge of the scuttle hole or attic entrance.

**(B) Cable Installed Parallel to Framing Members.** Where the cable is installed parallel to the sides of rafters, studs, or floor joists, neither guard strips nor running boards shall be required, and the installation shall also comply with 300.4(D).

### (A) Cables Run Across the Top of Floor Joists

https://up.codes/s/cables-run-across-the-top-of-floor-joists

When running cables perpendicular to rafters, you must protect all cables running atop the joists. The [2011 NEC 334.23](https://up.codes/s/nonmetallic-sheathed-cable-types-nm-and-nmc) references [320.23 (type AC)](https://up.codes/s/armored-cable-type-ac) and [330.23 (type MC)](https://up.codes/s/metal-clad-cable-type-mc) for type NM (Romex) cables. Additionally, when running cables across the face of rafters or studding, you should use substantial guard strips that are at least as high as the cable23.

I hope this information is helpful! Let me know if there’s anything else I can assist you with.

# Stapling

If you need to secure cables along a joist or framing member, use [cable staples](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Klein-Tools-Staples-11-32-Inch-x-19-32-Inch-Insulated-450-003/311762827) designed for electrical work. These staples prevent pinching or damaging the cable insulation. **Avoid over-tightening staples**.

You can use a hammer or a [staple gun](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Klein-Tools-Loose-Cable-Stapler-450-100/311762810).

## 6-12 Inches from Junction Boxes

It's a common requirement to secure cables within 6-12 inches of junction boxes, outlets, switches, or other termination points. This helps ensure that the cable is adequately supported as it enters or exits the box.

## Every 4.5 Feet along a Joist or Framing Member

Another common guideline is to staple cables at intervals of no more than 4.5 feet along attic joists or framing members. This spacing helps prevent sagging or excessive movement of the cables.

# Protection

In areas where the cables might be exposed to physical damage or where they pass through framing members, protect them with conduit or [conduit sleeves](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Gardner-Bender-3-8-in-and-1-2-in-Flex-Tubing-7-ft-and-10-ft-Combo-Pack-FLX-538C10/205588197).

# Clearance from Insulation

Maintain proper clearance between cables and insulation to prevent overheating. Follow local codes for the required clearance, which is **typically 1-3 inches**.

# Junction Boxes

All splices and connections should be made in approved [electrical junction boxes](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Steel-City-1-Gang-4-in-New-Work-Metal-Electrical-Wall-Box-with-Ground-Bump-521511234GB-50R/206166843). Junction boxes should remain accessible and not be buried under insulation or drywall.

# Labeling

==Label junction boxes and both ends of cables== to identify the circuit and purpose for future reference. This can be extremely helpful when troubleshooting or performing maintenance.

# GFCI and AFCI Protection

Ensure that the circuits in your attic are appropriately protected by Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters (GFCIs) and Arc Fault Circuit Interrupters (AFCIs) as required by code.

# Safety Gear

When working in an attic, wear appropriate [[Shopping/House Ideas/Inventory|safety gear]], such as **gloves**, a **dust mask**, and **eye protection**, and be mindful of your footing to avoid stepping through the ceiling below.

# Plan Ahead

Before running wires, plan your electrical circuits carefully to ensure they meet your current and future needs. Running additional wires for future use while you have attic access can save you time and effort later.
