# Ozone Machine

## How it Works

An ozone generator works by electrifying a couple ceramic plates to create ozone. Ozone is the term used when 3 oxygen atoms are together instead of just 2 or 1. ==The third oxygen atom is extremely unstable, so it tries to find something suitable to oxidize with. The easiest thing is something organic, so when it gets close to that organic material, it violently oxidizes.==

Destroying that organic matter and leaving with something oxidized. It oxidizes with many different organic and inorganic materials, so there is no specific chemical reaction to put into words. So, in the video, the purple material had something that the ozone could oxidize with, destroying the purple material.

### Ozone Is Generated By Passing Oxygen Through A  High-voltage Electrical Field

Ozone machines generate ozone by passing oxygen molecules through a high-voltage electrical field or a corona discharge. This process breaks apart the oxygen molecules (O2) and allows them to recombine into ozone molecules (O3). Ozone generators function by applying electrical energy to ceramic plates, facilitating the formation of ozone. The ozone is then released into the air for various applications, such as air purification or odor removal. Keep in mind that ozone generators should be used with caution, as excessive ozone exposure can be harmful to health. 

#### Understanding The Chemical Reaction

Ceramic plates imparts energy to oxygen molecules, causing electrons within the molecules to become highly energized. This excess energy disrupts the stable balance of the covalent bond between the oxygen atoms in the molecule. The electrons, when energized, move to higher energy levels around the atoms. The covalent bond between the oxygen atoms is formed by the sharing of electrons in specific orbitals. When extra energy causes the electrons to move into an excited state, the electrons are not as tightly held by their respective atoms, and the bond between the oxygen atoms becomes weaker. Consequently, the bond breaks, resulting in the dissociation of the oxygen molecule into two individual oxygen atoms. This process, known as electrical discharge, forms the basis for ozone generation:

$$O2 + energy → 2O (oxygen dissociation)$$

In simpler terms, the energy provides the electrons with the "push" they need to overcome the attractive forces that hold them in the covalent bond, causing the bond to break and the oxygen molecule to dissociate into its constituent atoms. This process is known as **photoionization** or **electrical discharge** and plays a key role in various chemical reactions and phenomena, including ozone generation.

When two of these reactive oxygen atoms (O) come into close proximity, their unpaired electrons can interact and form a temporary bond. This bond is facilitated by a process called collision-induced recombination. The two oxygen atoms share electrons to create a molecular arrangement where three oxygen atoms are bound together, resulting in an ozone molecule (O3):

$$O2 + O → O3 (ozone formation)$$

The newly formed ozone molecule (O3) is characterized by a relatively weak and unstable bond. This instability is responsible for ozone's highly reactive nature and its propensity to participate in various chemical reactions, including its well-known role in absorbing ultraviolet (UV) radiation in the Earth's stratosphere.

Vinegar is known for its acidic nature and is often **used for odor elimination**. It can help break down and neutralize odors, including smoke smells. Vinegar is particularly useful for absorbing and eliminating odors on porous surfaces like walls.

Dawn dish soap, on the other hand, is a powerful grease and stain remover. It is effective in **cutting through grease, oils, and residues** that may be present on surfaces. While it may not have the same odor-neutralizing properties as vinegar, it can help in removing smoke residue and general dirt or grime from surfaces.

When it comes to removing smoke smells, the best approach may involve using both vinegar and Dawn dish soap, depending on the specific situation. Here's a suggested method:

1. Vinegar: Use a vinegar solution (equal parts vinegar and water) to spray and wipe down the walls. This will help neutralize the smoke odor and penetrate porous surfaces.
    
2. Dawn dish soap: Create a solution of warm water and a few drops of Dawn dish soap. Use a sponge or cloth dampened with this solution to gently scrub the walls, focusing on areas with visible residue or stubborn stains. Rinse with clean water afterward.

# Trisodium phosphate (TSP)

Trisodium phosphate (TSP) can be an effective cleaner for removing smoke smells from surfaces in a house. Here are the steps you can follow to use TSP to remove smoke smell:

1. **Safety precautions**: Put on protective gloves, safety goggles, and a face mask to protect yourself from the chemicals.
    
2. **Dilute TSP**: Follow the instructions on the TSP packaging to mix the appropriate amount of TSP with water in a bucket. Usually, a ratio of ==1/2 cup of TSP per gallon of water== is recommended, but it may vary, so check the packaging.
    
3. **Preparing the affected areas**: Remove any loose debris or dirt from the surfaces you want to clean. Open windows or provide proper ventilation in the area to ensure good airflow.
    
4. **Cleaning process**: Dip a sponge or scrub brush into the TSP solution and scrub the affected surfaces thoroughly. Pay special attention to walls, ceilings, and other surfaces where smoke odor is present. Work in small sections and rinse the sponge or brush regularly in the TSP solution.
    
5. **Rinse with clean water**: After cleaning, rinse the surfaces with clean water to remove any remaining TSP residue. You can use a separate sponge or cloth soaked in clean water for this purpose.
    
6. **Drying**: Allow the surfaces to air dry naturally. Opening windows or using fans can help expedite the drying process.
    
7. **Repeat if necessary**: For strong smoke odors, you may need to repeat the process in areas that still retain the smell. It may take several attempts to completely eliminate the odor.
    

Remember to always follow the instructions and safety guidelines provided by the TSP manufacturer. Additionally, it's a good idea to test the TSP solution on a small, inconspicuous area first to ensure it doesn't cause any damage or discoloration to the surfaces you're cleaning.

# When to use a dehumidifier

A dehumidifier is useful when indoor humidity levels are consistently higher than 50%. This can lead to issues like mold growth, musty odors, and discomfort. A good time to use a dehumidifier is:

1. **Summer:** Humidity tends to be higher during the summer months, so it's a good time to use a dehumidifier to maintain a comfortable indoor environment.

2. **Rainy Seasons:** If you experience heavy rainfall or live in a humid climate, a dehumidifier can help manage excess moisture in your home.

3. **Damp Areas:** If certain rooms or basements feel consistently damp, a dehumidifier can help prevent mold and mildew growth.

4. **After Flooding:** If your home has experienced flooding, using a dehumidifier can aid in drying out the affected areas and preventing mold.

Remember to monitor the humidity levels in your home using a hygrometer. If the indoor humidity consistently exceeds 50%, it's a good idea to use a dehumidifier to maintain a healthier and more comfortable living environment.

## How It Helps Reduce Odor

a dehumidifier can help remove bad odors in a house to some extent, especially if the odor is caused by excess moisture. Here's how a dehumidifier can contribute to odor reduction:

1. **Moisture Reduction:** Bad odors can often be exacerbated by high humidity levels, which create a favorable environment for mold, mildew, and bacteria growth. A dehumidifier works by extracting excess moisture from the air, thus reducing the conditions that foster the growth of these odor-causing agents.
    
2. **Mold and Mildew Prevention:** Mold and mildew are common sources of unpleasant odors in homes. By maintaining optimal indoor humidity levels (usually between 30-50%), a dehumidifier can help prevent mold and mildew growth, which in turn reduces associated odors.
    
3. **Odor Absorption:** Some dehumidifiers are equipped with filters or technologies designed to capture and reduce odors. These may include activated carbon filters that can absorb odorous particles from the air, contributing to fresher indoor air quality.
    
4. **Ventilation Improvement:** A dehumidifier can indirectly help with ventilation. When humidity is lowered, it becomes easier for air to circulate and flow, potentially carrying away stagnant air and odors.
    

However, it's important to note that while a dehumidifier can be effective for addressing moisture-related odor issues, it might not eliminate all types of bad odors. Odors caused by factors such as cooking, pet odors, or chemicals may require additional methods for effective removal, such as proper cleaning, ventilation, or using air purifiers with specific odor-fighting filters.

For the best results, it's advisable to identify the source of the odor and address it directly, while using a dehumidifier to control moisture and prevent the growth of odor-causing agents.
