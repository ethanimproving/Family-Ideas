> **Taping Knife:** A flat, [wide knife](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Wal-Board-Tools-12-in-Stainless-Steel-Blade-Taping-Knife-020-042-HD/100660210) used for applying tape and joint compound to drywall seams.

> **Factory Joint:** A joint where the edges of two drywall sheets meet. The edges are tapered or beveled during the manufacturing process to facilitate easier finishing.

> **Butt Joint:** When the ends of two drywall sheets meet. Butt joints take more work during the finishing process to avoid visible seams.

## Mudding

### Tips

1. [Finish to sand, don't sand to finish](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Fq9SrIstffs).
2. [Add water to mix the mud](https://youtu.be/naBal346_9c?si=ClK1omn4LUd1DsbD&t=366).
3. [Finished with runny consistency](https://youtube.com/shorts/UXTNsXSI3ls?feature=share) because it thickens as it pulls moisture out of the wall.
4. [Shine light across the wall to see where mud needs to be feathered](https://youtube.com/shorts/hfMJTcvzW3Y)
5. [Use lightweight all-purpose mud](https://youtube.com/shorts/7l_mNTmfp3k)

### Unipatching

[3 Passes](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/XUikCql3_Yg):
1. **Load:** [Apply you mud](https://youtu.be/ExrlG2c2KtI?si=rPYR3o54Yr1YN9qz&t=360).
2. **Feather:** [Feather your outside edges](https://youtu.be/ExrlG2c2KtI?si=KmN7OU3eCkdxXRri&t=386). You don't want to be left with some hard buildup on the edges when it starts drying out.
3. **Finish:** Move the trowel across the surface of the patches, [tilting it slightly in alternating directions with each pass](https://youtu.be/ExrlG2c2KtI?si=GA0EpN6et9ICyQYP&t=428). Ensure that the leading edge of the trowel is angled towards the outer edges during one pass and then switch to angling it the opposite way on the next pass. This technique helps feather the edges smoothly for a more even finish

# Skim Coating Over Texture

**1. Soak and Scrape Method (for unpainted texture):**

- **Protect the area:** Cover floors and furniture with drop cloths.
- **Spray and soften:** Use a spray bottle filled with warm water to thoroughly dampen the textured area. Allow 15-20 minutes for the texture to soften.
- **Scrape carefully:** Use a 10-inch drywall taping knife held at a 30-degree angle to gently scrape off the softened texture. Work in small sections, dampening as needed.
- **Sand lightly:** Once the texture is removed, use fine-grit sandpaper to smooth out any rough spots.

**2. Skimming Method (for painted texture):**

- **Apply joint compound:** Use a wide taping knife to spread a thin layer of joint compound over the entire textured surface.
- **Smooth and feather edges:** Flatten the compound, blending the edges seamlessly with the surrounding wall. Allow it to dry.
- **Apply additional coats (if needed):** Repeat the process until the texture is completely covered and the desired smoothness is achieved.
- **Sand and prime:** Once dry, sand lightly to remove any imperfections and prime the surface before painting.
