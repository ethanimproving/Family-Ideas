# Cutting the ceiling joist

## STEP 1
![](https://i.imgur.com/AaNESBG.png)

- If the room has a ceiling in which you made the opening, proceed to **Step 2**.
- If there is no ceiling in place, mark the joists according to instruction:
  - **A** - If the chosen location is parallel to the ceiling joists, mark the length of the opening on the top surface of the joist as shown on Figure 9. Do not cut the joist as marked.
  - **B** - If the chosen location is perpendicular to the ceiling joists, mark the width of the opening on the top surface of the joist as shown on Figure 8. Do not cut the joist as marked.

## STEP 2

Cut 2 pieces of board similar to the size of the ceiling joist, long enough to nail them to the ceiling joists on both ends of the opening (Figure 10). These boards will provide support to joists which will be cut out.

## STEP 3

Position these boards approximately 2 ft from the opening edge (pic 10).

**Note:** The 2 ft space is required to nail the frame.

Next, decide where you will cut the joist (see Figure 11). The cutting line should be away from the actual opening twice the thickness of the frame (usually 3 inches). This will allow you to install double headers at both ends of the joist (pic 17 pg.8).

**Note:** In older homes, the thickness of the joist might be greater than what is currently sold in lumber yards. In such a case, the cutting line should be marked at twice the thickness of the material which you will use to build the frame, not the joist.

## STEP 5

Cut the joist carefully, watching not to cut the ceiling board, and making sure that the cut-out joist is even and vertical (square).
