# Cutting the ceiling joist

## STEP 1

- If the room has a ceiling in which you made the opening, proceed to **Step 2**.
- If there is no ceiling in place, mark the joists according to instruction:
  - **A** - If the chosen location is parallel to the ceiling joists, mark the length of the opening on the top surface of the joist as shown on Figure 9. Do not cut the joist as marked.

## STEP 2

Cut 2 pieces of board similar to the size of the ceiling joist, long enough to nail them to the ceiling joists on both ends of the opening (Figure 10). These boards will provide support to joists which will be cut out.

## STEP 3

Position these boards approximately 2 ft from the opening edge (pic 10).

**Note:** The 2 ft space is required to nail the frame.

## STEP 4

Next, decide where you will cut the joist (see Figure 11). The cutting line should be away from the actual opening twice the thickness of the frame (usually 3 inches). This will allow you to install double headers at both ends of the joist (pic 17 pg.8).

**Note:** In older homes, the thickness of the joist might be greater than what is currently sold in lumber yards. In such a case, the cutting line should be marked at twice the thickness of the material which you will use to build the frame, not the joist.

## STEP 5

Cut the joist carefully, watching not to cut the ceiling board, and making sure that the cut-out joist is even and vertical (square).


# Framing the installation opening

## Installing the single headers

### STEP 1

Measure the distance between the ceiling joists. The measurement should be done perpendicular to the joist (Figure 12).
![](https://i.imgur.com/mK3ooSw.png)

### STEP 2

Cut 2 boards for headers to the measured length. Use timber material similar in size to the joists.

### STEP 3

Position the header at one end of the installation opening (Figure 13). The header must tightly fit between the joists. If needed, use a hammer to position the header.
![](https://i.imgur.com/wvFJhJT.png)

### Step 4

Align the header at a 90-degree angle to the joists and drive 3 nails (16D) at each end.

### STEP 5

Position the second header 47 inches apart from the first one for LWSP 22/47, LWS-P 25/47, or 54 inches for LWS-P 22/54, LWS-P 25/54, and repeat Step 4 (Figure 14).

### STEP 6

The frame must have four sides where the headers are two of them. If the ceiling joists are positioned as the other two sides, check the angles by measuring the diagonals. Both measured dimensions should be within 1/8 inch to consider them equal.

# Installation of the temporary support boards

Before you begin: The frame around the ceiling opening must be finished

## STEP 1

Using 4 nails or screws, attach the temporary support board 1" x 4" x 36" where the hinged end of the ladder will be installed. This temporary support board must form a 1/4" ledge across the ceiling opening (Figure 20).
![](https://i.imgur.com/q20UvQv.png)

**Note:** It is recommended to use double-headed nails which can be easily removed.

## STEP 2

Using 4 nails or screws, attach the second temporary support at the other end of the opening so that the temporary support boards are "X" inches apart (see table 3).

# Positioning the attic ladder

## STEP 1

Take out the control rod (Figure 21). Leave the control rod for the person working below the ceiling.
![](https://i.imgur.com/zxEwIjI.png)

## STEP 2

One person must go into the attic space while the other person stays below.

**WARNING:** The attic ladder cannot be used to climb into the overhead space until it is permanently installed to the previously made frame, and until the legs are trimmed to the appropriate length. Therefore, in some cases, the person in the overhead space must remain there until the end of installation.

## STEP 3

Make sure that people other than installers are kept clear from the working area.

## STEP 4

Carefully position the attic ladder on the temporary support so that the hinged end rests on the 1/4" ledge. The person working in the overhead space is blocking the attic ladder with shims, preventing it from falling down from the ledges (Figure 22). Shims should be inserted between the case of the attic ladder and the headers at the opening end. Make sure that the attic ladder rests on the temporary support boards.
![](https://i.imgur.com/pMQmtDp.png)

## STEP 5

Open the attic ladder using the control rod by turning it 90 degrees (arrow 1) counterclockwise (Figure 23). Pull the lid until fully open and until the blocking mechanism is engaged (arrow 2).

# Shimming, squaring and nailing the attic ladder

## Before you begin:

The attic ladder should be resting on the temporary support boards. The lid should be openable, but do not unfold legs of the attic ladder.

**Warning:** Do not unfold legs of the attic ladder yet. Use of the attic ladder is not safe yet. Do not step on the attic ladder nor leave it unattended until completely installed and both legs are adjusted to rest on the floor. This can damage the attic ladder and cause severe injury.

## STEP 1

Insert the wooden shims between the case of the attic ladder and the frame (as shown in Figure 24) until it is square in the frame you built. The shims should be inserted from the top and bottom and not extend below the ceiling surface.

**Note:** Use of oversized shims can damage the casement of the attic ladder. Check the squareness of the frame by measuring the diagonals (Figure 24). Both measurements should be within 1/8" to be considered square.
![](https://i.imgur.com/UuCnHXX.png)

## STEP 2

Using a 1/8" drill bit, pre-drill nail locations in the ladder casing (Figure 25). Do not drill through joists and headers. Drilling should be done on the longer sides of the casement where the shims are, in the middle of the casement's height.
![](https://i.imgur.com/VIiuCUG.png)

Nail the attic ladder following instructions:
a. Drive 6 nails 20d or screws 4", check squareness.
b. Be careful not to hit the spring or the hinge.

## STEP 3

Trim the sticking-out shims. Upon complete installation, you can also remove the temporary shims.


# Cutting the feet to fit

- [Cut the feet to fit](https://www.tiktok.com/@mordecaithebuilder/video/7268366482306878766?q=Install%20Attic%20Stairs&t=1703651263475)

## Before you begin:

The attic ladder should be properly shimmed and securely nailed to the frame in the proper location.

**WARNING:** Use of the attic ladder is not safe yet. Do not unfold the attic ladder yet. Do not step on the attic ladder nor leave it unattended until completely installed and both legs are adjusted to rest on the floor. This can damage the attic ladder and cause severe injury.

## STEP 1

Make sure that the lid is fully open. Unfold legs of the attic ladder and fold the bottom section as shown in Figure 26.
![](https://i.imgur.com/mCnGf4U.png)

## STEP 2

Loosen screws as shown by arrow 1 and move the steps away from the lid as shown by arrow 2 (Figure 27).
![](https://i.imgur.com/RZmPaNX.png)

## STEP 3

Tighten the previously loosened screws as shown by arrow 3 (Figure 28).
![](https://i.imgur.com/HBP2m3b.png)

**WARNING:** Upon completion of these tasks, the distance between the steps and the lid should remain constant. Otherwise, this can cause damage to the attic ladder and cause severe injuries.

## STEP 4: Measuring

Using a [straight edge](https://www.homedepot.com/p/POWERTEC-50-in-Anodized-Aluminum-Straight-Edge-Ruler-Metal-Machined-Flat-to-Within-0-003-in-Over-Full-50-in-71503/313566829), measure the distance "A" and "B" as shown on Figure 26. This measurement should be very precise to ensure proper trimming of the legs.

**ATTENTION:** Measure the distance "A" and "B" on both sides of the attic ladder. The distance may not be the same on both sides of the attic ladder.

## STEP 5: Marking

Measure the "A" and "B" distance from the top edge of the bottom section of the attic ladder and mark it on both legs (Figure 29). Trim lines must be accurate to avoid trimming the legs too short.
![](https://i.imgur.com/02kT3sw.png)

**WARNING:** If the trimming line is marked along the rung, reposition the full run of steps where it is attached to the lid. The trimming line must not be in line with the rung (Figure 30). Next, repeat measurements "A" and "B" starting from step 4.
![](https://i.imgur.com/koRja2s.png)

## STEP 6: Sawing

Trim the legs along the trimming lines. Trim the corners of the legs perpendicular to side "B" but no more than 1/2" from the corner (Figure 29). Using an attic ladder with too short legs will damage the ladder and can cause severe injuries.

## STEP 7

Check for proper trimming of the legs by unfolding the full run. The ladder should look like Figure 31. There should be no gaps between the metal hinges, and the feet should be flush with the floor.
![](https://i.imgur.com/H3zF4Hg.png)

**ATTENTION:** Gaps between the metal hinges mean that the feet are not properly trimmed (Figure 32 and 33). Do not climb the attic ladder if there are visible gaps between the metal hinges. This can cause damage to the attic ladder and result in serious injury. If the attic ladder looks like Figure 32, one or both legs are too long. Send or trim the feet until there are no gaps between the metal hinges, and both legs are flush with the floor. If the legs look like Figure 33, both legs are too short. If there are no gaps between the metal hinges but one leg is too short, use of the attic ladder is not safe. If the legs are trimmed too short, do not use the attic ladder. Contact your local dealer.
