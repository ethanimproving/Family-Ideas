# Things To Look For

When choosing a vacuum sander, consider the following factors:

- **Dust Collection**: Look for a sander with a reliable and efficient dust collection system. Drywall sanding can create a lot of fine dust, and a good dust collection system will keep your workspace cleaner and healthier.
    
- **Power and Speed**: For a 1979 house with potentially thick texture, you might want a sander with enough power and variable speed settings to tackle the job effectively.
    
- **Weight and Ergonomics**: Since sanding can be a physically demanding task, consider a sander that is lightweight and ergonomically designed for comfortable use over extended periods.
    
- **Reviews and Recommendations**: Before purchasing, read reviews and seek recommendations from other homeowners or professionals who have used the sander for similar tasks.
    

Keep in mind that advancements in technology and product releases might have occurred since my last update. I recommend checking the latest reviews and ratings for vacuum sanders for removing texture to find the most suitable option available in the current market.

# Festool Planex vs. WEN Comparison

The Festool Planex LHS 225 Drywall Sander and the WEN 6369 Variable Speed Drywall Sander are both tools designed for drywall sanding, but there are significant differences between the two in terms of quality, features, and price. Here's a comparison of the main differences:

1. **Brand and Quality:**
    - Festool is a well-known and respected brand in the professional tool industry, known for producing high-quality and reliable tools. The Festool Planex LHS 225 is considered a premium drywall sander designed for professional use.
    - WEN, on the other hand, is a brand that offers more budget-friendly tools ==targeted at DIYers and hobbyists==. While they provide good value for their price, they may not have the same level of build quality and durability as premium brands like Festool.
2. **Performance and Power:**
    
    - The Festool Planex LHS 225 is a powerful drywall sander with a robust motor and efficient sanding performance. It is designed for large-scale sanding projects and can handle heavy-duty tasks effectively.
    - The WEN 6369 Variable Speed Drywall Sander also has decent power with its 5-amp motor, but it may not be as powerful or efficient as the Festool model. It is more ==suitable for smaller to medium-sized sanding jobs==.
3. **Dust Extraction:**
    
    - One area where Festool excels is its dust extraction system. The Festool Planex LHS 225 is known for its excellent dust collection capabilities, keeping the workspace cleaner and reducing airborne dust significantly.
    - The WEN 6369 also has a dust collection system, but it ==might not be as effective as the Festool's, especially for larger sanding projects==.
4. **Price:**
    
    - Festool tools tend to be on the higher end of the price spectrum due to their premium build quality and performance. They are often considered an investment for professional contractors who require top-notch tools for their work.
    - WEN, as a more budget-friendly brand, offers tools at a more affordable price point, making them attractive options for homeowners and DIY enthusiasts on a budget.
5. **Intended Users:**
    
    - The Festool Planex LHS 225 is primarily aimed at professional contractors, drywall installers, and other trade professionals who need a reliable and powerful tool for frequent and demanding use.
    - The WEN 6369 is more ==suitable for homeowners and DIYers who have occasional drywall sanding projects== and may not require the same level of performance and durability as a professional-grade tool.

In summary, the Festool Planex LHS 225 is a premium, high-performance drywall sander intended for professionals who value top-quality tools and efficient dust extraction. On the other hand, the WEN 6369 offers a more budget-friendly option for homeowners and DIYers who need a capable drywall sander for occasional use.
