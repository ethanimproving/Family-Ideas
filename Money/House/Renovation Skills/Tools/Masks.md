Please note that the above ratings are commonly used in the United States and are **based on NIOSH (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) standards**. Ratings may vary in different regions or countries, so it's essential to refer to local standards and regulations for specific respiratory mask ratings.

### Exhaust Ports

Masks that have exhaust ports allow the hot air, which you're breathing out, to get out of the mask. Otherwise, that hot and humid air remains trapped inside, and if you think about it, that's kind of gross. This 3M mask has the port facing down. This [makes all the difference](https://youtu.be/Rks83yMD6Io?t=674) in the mask's performance. ==Having the port facing down is essential because it prevents your safety glasses from fogging up== when you're working hard and expelling a lot of moisture.
