There is one plumber per 688 people in the United States. That means on average you would call the plumber once every 0.7 years. ChatGPT estimates a typically person needs to call the plumber 1-3 times per year, meaning there is a slight shortage of plumbers for the amount of work needed. It's a good skill to have.

# Replace Soldered Stop Valve with Quarter Turns

![](https://i.imgur.com/jSgorxb.png)


Older houses often soldered stop valves onto the pipe. In order to get it off, you need to melt the solder with a propane torch or a butane torch. The trick is the melt the solder without creating a soft spot in the metal pipe. Luckily solder has a lower melting point of ~400°F compared to a copper pipe with a melting point of ~1,982°. If you time it decently, you should be able to pull the stop valve off with a pair of plyers. You want to wear gloves during the entire melting process and ensure you never touch the hot components. 

## Supplies Needed:

- Quarter-turn faucet kit (includes faucet, supply lines, and any necessary fittings)
- Adjustable wrench or pipe wrench
- Propane torch
- Emery cloth or sandpaper
- Deburring tool or file
- Heat-resistant gloves

## Steps to Replace Soldered Faucet with Quarter Turn:

1. **Shut off Water**: Turn off the water supply to the faucet you're replacing. You may need to shut off the main water supply to your house.
    
2. **Drain Water**: Turn on the faucet to drain any remaining water from the pipes.
    
3. **Remove Old Faucet**: Use a wrench to disconnect the old faucet from the water supply lines. If it's soldered, you'll need to heat the solder joints with a propane torch until the solder melts, then remove the faucet.
    
4. **Prepare Pipes**: Use emery cloth or sandpaper to clean the ends of the copper pipes where the new fittings will be soldered. Ensure they are clean and free of any corrosion.
    
5. **Cut Pipes (if necessary)**: If the new faucet doesn't align with the existing pipes, you may need to cut and modify them using a pipe cutter or hacksaw. Measure carefully and make straight cuts.
    
6. **[Deburr Pipes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCjEXsHfKI8)**: Use a deburring tool or file to remove any burrs or rough edges from the cut pipes to ensure a smooth fit with the new fittings.
    
7. **Attach New Fittings**: Follow the manufacturer's instructions to attach the new fittings from the quarter-turn faucet kit to the copper pipes. Apply soldering flux to the cleaned pipe ends and fittings.
    
8. **Solder Joints**: Heat the fittings with a propane torch until they are hot enough to melt the solder. Apply solder to the joint, allowing it to flow evenly around the connection. Ensure a watertight seal.
    
9. **Install Faucet**: Attach the new quarter-turn faucet to the fittings, following the manufacturer's instructions. Tighten the connections with a wrench.
    
10. **Connect Supply Lines**: Connect the supply lines from the faucet to the corresponding hot and cold water supply pipes. Tighten the connections with a wrench.
    
11. **Turn on Water**: Turn on the water supply and check for leaks. If any leaks are found, tighten connections as needed.
    
12. **Test Faucet**: Turn on the faucet and test for proper operation. Ensure hot and cold water flow smoothly and there are no leaks.
