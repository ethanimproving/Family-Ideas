Luckily insurance is covering the roof, which includes the fascia boards. You always replace the fascia boards before the roo

# Oakmore

The [fascia board at Oakmore Dr.](https://photos.app.goo.gl/7dp3ha1gLeo3zXs49) has been rotting for some time, and was patched with metal. The problem with nailing metal to rotting wood is that it doesn't stick.

### Color Popularity

A Sherman Williams employee told me a common color for trim is Snowbound. This is consistent with the Bridgewater Homes by Lennar which all use [SW7004 Snowbound](https://www.sherwin-williams.com/en-us/color/color-family/white-paint-colors/sw7004-snowbound). I do really like those houses so I will choose that color for my trim as well.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=4Qa18K5ii6k) recommends warmer white like Alabaster [SW 7008](https://www.sherwin-williams.com/en-us/color/color-family/white-paint-colors/sw7008-alabaster) to compliment red brick.

## 3. Install New Board

For this step I will be dealing with 16-foot boards that need to be held in place. Uncle Stu suggested a method of creating a bracket screwed into the soffit at the appropriate length that the fascia hangs down. This bracket will providing a stable resting point for the fascia board during installation.

### Temporary Ledge

An adjustable Z bracket could potentially work for this purpose. We could mount the vertical portion of the bracket to the underside of the soffit, and then adjust the horizontal arm to the desired length to provide support for the fascia board. This would effectively create a temporary ledge for the fascia board to rest on while you nail or screw it in place.

### Nail Gun

Once the boards are resting in place, use a nail gun to pop nails into the wood an keep that sucker up.
