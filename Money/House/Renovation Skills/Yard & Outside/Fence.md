This is only urgent because the city has already given a citation for the fence.

# Place Poles

To place metal poles in the ground for a fence in Texas, you can follow these general steps:

1. **Determine the fence layout**: Decide on the exact location and dimensions of your fence. Mark the perimeter using stakes or flags.
    
2. **Check for underground utilities**: Before digging any holes, contact your local utility companies to ensure there are no underground cables or pipes in the area where you plan to dig.
    
3. **Gather materials and tools**: You'll need metal fence posts, concrete mix, gravel, a post hole digger or auger, a level, string or line level, a shovel, a wheelbarrow, and a hammer.
    
4. **Dig the post holes**: Use a [post hole digger](https://www.homedepot.com/c/augers_equipment_rental?mtc=SEM-BF-RNT-GGL-D78-Multi-NA-NA-NA-ETA-NA-NA-NA-NA-BT2-NA-NA-NA-G_B_THDR_Tool_SOUTHWEST_E&cm_mmc=SEM-BF-RNT-GGL-D78-Multi-NA-NA-NA-ETA-NA-NA-NA-NA-BT2-NA-NA-NA-G_B_THDR_Tool_SOUTHWEST_E-71700000055103346-58700005198609301-43700045855028872&gad=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw2K6lBhBXEiwA5RjtCUxmoe6Ih2ar7AflQAcBSVzH7q1sKP1lv7t-FvuPVxQHsQizOUAsJxoCrw4QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) or auger to dig holes for the metal poles. The depth and diameter of the holes will depend on the type of fence and local building codes. As a general rule, the hole should be at least one-third of the length of the metal pole, and the diameter should be wider at the bottom than at the top.
    
5. **Insert the metal poles**: Place a [metal pole](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-1-5-8-in-Dia-x-8-ft-16-Gauge-Galvanized-Steel-Chain-Link-Fence-Line-Post-328923DPTSEB/312373067#overlay) into each hole, ensuring they are level and plumb. Use a level to check for vertical alignment. You may need to add or remove soil at the base of the hole to achieve the proper depth.
    
6. **Secure the metal poles**: Once the poles are in position, backfill the holes with concrete mix. Prepare the concrete according to the manufacturer's instructions and pour it into the holes around the poles. Ensure that the poles remain level and plumb while the concrete sets.
    
7. **Brace and support**: If you're installing a tall or heavy fence, it's advisable to install temporary braces to keep the poles in place until the concrete has fully cured. This will provide additional support during the installation process.
    
8. **Allow the concrete to cure**: Give the concrete ample time to cure and harden. This usually takes 24 to 48 hours, but refer to the specific instructions provided by the concrete manufacturer.
    
9. **Add gravel and backfill**: Once the concrete has cured, you can add gravel around the base of the poles to improve drainage and stability. Backfill the remaining space with soil and compact it to secure the poles further.
    
10. **Install the fence**: Once the poles are securely in place, you can attach the fence panels or rails to the metal poles according to the manufacturer's instructions.
    
11. Top with [metal caps](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-Chain-Link-Fence-2-3-8-in-Aluminum-Post-Cap-328558EB/312373085)

Remember to check your local building codes and regulations before beginning the fence installation process, as specific requirements may vary.
