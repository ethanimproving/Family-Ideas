# How Many Cameras Do I Need?

## 4 Outdoor
1. Front door (Doorbell)
2. Back door
3. Garage Door (With light)
4. Back Yard

## 4 Indoor
1. Living Room
2. Master Room (4K)
3. Sun Room
4. Garage

## SD Cards
[SanDisk MicroSD Cards (128GB)](https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Extreme-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B09X7BK27V/ref=sr_1_4) @ $15

$$$15 * 8 = $120$$

# Wyze Bundle

Cost: $285

Wyze cameras are attractive because they seam to be the more popular compared to blink, cheaper compared to Arlo. The downside is that with an SD card, the only recording option available is a continuous stream, so you have to find out where the events are. The upside is that if you want to record a time-lapse, or work on the yard, you don't wave to piece the videos together.

# Blink Bundle

Cost: $265

No 4k cam, but you save about $120 by eliminating SD cards compared to Wyze. ==I do like the Sync Module.== I'm going to say Wyze is the winner on this because of the choppy 10 second clips you get with Blink.
