[Dyson V12 Detect Slim Absolute vacuum](https://www.dyson.com/vacuum-cleaners/cordless/v12/detect-slim-absolute-hepa-gold?source_description=yext%7Evacuums%7EDyson+V12+Detect+Slim%E2%84%A2+Absolute)

The V12 is slimmer and a pound lighter, making it significantly less tiring to use. It was a button on the top that lets you keep the vacuum on without holding down the on button continually, as opposed to the V15. The dust bin is easier to empty out than the V15.

The V15 is better for deep cleaning carpets as it has a suction power of 230AW opposed to the V12's 150AW. It comes at the expense of the added weight and the trigger mechanism.
