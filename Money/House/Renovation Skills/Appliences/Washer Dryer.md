[LG 4.5 cu. ft. Combination ELECTRIC Front Load Washer/Dryer with Allergiene Cycle](https://www.costco.com/lg-4.5-cu.-ft.-combination-electric-front-load-washer/dryer-with-allergiene-cycle.product.100660040.html)

This bad boy is a washer/dryer combined into 1 utility. You throw your clothes into it, and a couple hours later, it's done. You don't have to worry about moving from the washer to the dryer.

Stacey mentioned there was an extension for smaller loads so that you can run 2 loads at the same time. TODO: Ask her where to find that upgrade. She got hers on sale for $1,300.

It is also Wi-Fi Enabled and compatible with Alexa and Google Assistant.

My old lady friend from work told me that everyone she knows who got a front load washer smells bad after awhile. Is there any reason for this, or is it even true that front load washers tend to stink more than top load washers after while?

Front load washers can sometimes develop unpleasant odors over time, but it's not accurate to say that everyone who uses them will smell bad. The odor issue in front load washers is typically due to the following factors:

1. Sealing and Gasket Design: Front load washers have a rubber door gasket that can trap moisture, detergent residue, and lint. If not properly cleaned and dried after each use, these materials can promote the growth of mold and mildew, leading to unpleasant odors.
    
2. Low Water Usage: Front load washers are designed to use less water than top load washers, which can sometimes result in inadequate rinsing. Leftover detergent residue in the drum and on clothes can contribute to odor issues.
    

To prevent or minimize odor problems in front load washers, consider these tips:

1. **Regular Cleaning**: Wipe down the door gasket, drum, and detergent dispensers regularly to remove any residue and moisture. Use a mixture of vinegar and water or a specialized washing machine cleaner for this purpose.
    
2. **Leave the Door Open**: After each wash, leave the washer door ajar to allow moisture to evaporate and prevent mold growth.
    
3. **Use High-Efficiency Detergent**: Front load washers require high-efficiency (HE) detergent. Using the right detergent will help reduce the buildup of soap residue.
    
4. **Run Cleaning Cycles**: Some front load washers have a self-clean cycle. If yours does, use it periodically to clean the drum and gasket.
    
5. **Check for Blockages**: Ensure that the drain pump and filter are free of debris, as clogs can lead to stagnant water and odors.
    

It's important to note that proper maintenance and following these tips can help prevent odors in front load washers. If you experience persistent odors despite taking these measures, it could be a sign of a more significant issue, such as a malfunctioning drain system, and it may be necessary to consult a professional technician to address the problem. However, with regular care, front load washers can provide efficient and effective cleaning without causing unpleasant smells.
