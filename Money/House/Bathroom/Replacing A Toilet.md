### Best Way To Clean A Wax Ring

Here's how you can remove a wax ring and clean the wax off the ground:

**Tools and Materials You'll Need:**
- Disposable gloves
- Putty knife or scraper
- Plastic bag or trash bag
- Paper towels
- Warm soapy water
- Scrub brush

If you look closely, you can see the **PVC pipe** is decaying on the bottom left corner. That's not good.

**Steps:**

1. **Put on Gloves:** Wear disposable gloves to protect your hands.
	
2. **Turn Off Water Supply:** Before you start, turn off the water supply to the toilet and flush to drain the water from the tank and bowl.
	
3. **Disconnect Water Line:** Disconnect the water supply line from the toilet tank.
	
4. **Remove Toilet:** Carefully lift the toilet bowl straight up to detach it from the wax ring. Place the toilet on a plastic bag or trash bag to catch any water.
	
5. **Scrape Off Wax Ring:** Use a putty knife or scraper to gently scrape off the old wax ring from both the toilet flange (on the floor) and the toilet base. Be careful not to scratch the surfaces.
	
6. **Dispose of Wax Ring:** Dispose of the old wax ring in a plastic bag or trash bag.
	
7. **Clean the Floor:** Use paper towels to wipe up any remaining wax residue from the floor around the toilet flange.
	
8. **Use Warm Soapy Water:** Mix warm water with mild dish soap to create a soapy solution. Dip a scrub brush or cloth into the soapy water and gently scrub the floor around the toilet flange to remove any remaining wax.
	
9. **Rinse and Dry:** Rinse the area with clean water to remove any soap residue. Dry the floor thoroughly with paper towels or a clean cloth.
	
10. **Check for Residue:** Inspect the floor to ensure that all wax residue has been removed. If you notice any stubborn residue, you can repeat the cleaning process or use a bit of rubbing alcohol on a cloth to help dissolve the wax.
	
11. **Prepare for Installation:** Once the area is clean and dry, you can prepare to install a new wax ring and reattach the toilet.

Remember, if you're uncomfortable with the process or if you're not familiar with working on toilets, it's best to contact a professional plumber to handle the removal, cleaning, and reinstallation of the toilet to avoid any potential issues.

## Place Toilet on Flange

1. Rest new toilet on its side on top of towel or blanket on floor so it doesn’t get scratched or damaged during installation.
2. Install new wax ring onto flange on floor with tapered end facing up.
3. Rest toilet bowl upside down on towel or blanket next to flange so you can attach wax ring without having to hold bowl up at same time.

## Install Wax Ring

1. Line up bolts with holes in base of bowl and carefully lower bowl onto wax ring and flange so bolts come through holes in base of bowl.

## Install Toilet Bolts

1. Place washers and nuts onto bolts that secure bowl to floor.

## Set Toilet Bowl

1. Tighten nuts on bolts that secure bowl to floor with pliers or adjustable wrench.

## Attach Tank to Bowl

1. Place rubber gasket onto flush valve opening at bottom of tank.
2. Lower tank onto bowl so bolts come through mounting holes in bowl.

## Connect Water Supply Line

1. Connect water supply line to fill valve under bottom of tank.
2. Tighten nut by hand, then snug it tight with pliers.

## Install Seat

1. Attach seat according to manufacturer’s instructions.

Here are some tools and items needed for installation:

- Adjustable wrench
- Screwdriver
- Plunger
- Rubber gloves
- Sponge
- Bucket
- Towel or blanket
