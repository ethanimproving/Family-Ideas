Makes more sense to take out an annuity or self invest. The insurance company makes money because they are using your money and investing it to make a lot more than they're giving you. You are giving them those extra gains to hedge off the risk of market downturns.

Or use [an HSA](https://smart-choice.wealthcareportal.com/Page/HsaInvestments?accountId=1149938) to invest yourself.
