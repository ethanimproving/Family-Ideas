DO NOT start a chat. Just add the product to your cart and buy it. It wasted an hour and 40 minutes of my time for something that could have been 10 minutes. Omg.

Thank you Ethan & You have elected to enroll in AutoPay and authorize T-Mobile to automatically debit/charge your bank account/card, on a recurring basis no earlier than 2 days before the statement due date until you terminate your authorization online at my.T-Mobile.com or by calling 1-877-453-1304. You authorize T-Mobile to store your payment method for future payments by you and any verified users on the account. The amount of each monthly recurring payment will be the full monthly price reflected on your monthly statement for wireless service, plus any additional services, equipment, taxes, fees and other charges applicable to your T-Mobile purchase(s). If you find a billing error and notify T-Mobile at least 4 days before your monthly statement is due, we will attempt to correct the error before the next recurring payment. Also, if you sign up for, cancel or make changes to AutoPay 2 days or less before the payment due date, the change may not take effect until the following payment cycle. Otherwise, we will automatically debit/charge the amount reflected on your monthly statement. After terminating your authorization, you will be responsible for scheduling payments for subsequent monthly charges. You also authorize T-Mobile to credit your bank account/card in the appropriate amount for any refunds or other billing adjustments. These Terms and Conditions may be updated at any time, and changes become binding once posted to the T-Mobile website. T-Mobile shall bear no liability or responsibility for any losses of any kind that you may incur as a result of an erroneous statement, any delay in the actual date on which your account is debited or your failure to provide accurate and/or valid payment information.  

Additional Payment Terms and Conditions. If you are acting on behalf of a corporate, organizational or governmental entity, you represent that (1) you are authorized to sign on behalf of such entity and (2) the credit card you are using was established for business purposes and that it is not a debit card.  

T-MOBILE SHALL BEAR NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY LOSSES OF ANY KIND THAT YOU MAY INCUR AS A RESULT OF AN ERRONEOUS STATEMENT, ANY DELAY IN THE ACTUAL DATE ON WHICH YOUR ACCOUNT IS DEBITED OR YOUR FAILURE TO PROVIDE ACCURATE AND/OR VALID PAYMENT INFORMATION.  

You are responsible for the T-Mobile Home Internet Gateway ("Router") and it must be returned to us in an undamaged and working condition. If the Router is not returned, lost or stolen, you must pay the replacement cost of the Router up to $370.  
The Router must be returned immediately (a) upon our request; or (b) upon termination of your Home Internet Service with T-Mobile.  

You can return the Router by contacting Customer Care at 1-844-275-9310.. One moment please üòÉ

Be sure to download the T-Mobile Internet app and the T-Mobile app. You‚Äôll be able to start using these two apps after activation. Use the Gateway Placement Assistant in the T-Mobile Home Internet app to determine the best location in your home with best signal strength. Please make sure the Gateway is plugged in before connecting Wi-Fi devices and turn off previous internet equipment. In the T-Mobile app, set up your T-Mobile ID once your Home Internet is activated. When you receive the device, new firmware will download on first startup. This takes approximately 10 minutes. Please make sure the Gateway is plugged in before connecting Wi-Fi devices and turn off previous internet equipment. Your address that was approved for service is the only approved location to use T-Mobile Home Internet. Keep in mind the number and type of devices connected to the Wi-Fi can also impact experience. Lastly, look for an email from ‚ÄúMessage from T-Mobile Care‚Äù with some important resources to help you enjoy your new Home Internet service!
