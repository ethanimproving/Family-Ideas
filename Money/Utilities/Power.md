# Dad: Try a temporary plan

If you get to pick one, then go to https://powertochoose.com/ to find the best rate. Maybe there is a 3-month plan available. Low usage now, more after you move in.

# Caleb: Watch out for discount stipulations

Check out the following websites: 
- [Choose Texas Power](http://www.choosetexaspower.org/)
- [Power to Choose](http://www.powertochoose.org/)

Make sure you understand requirements. There are many plans with ==discount only if you are within a certain range== or it cost a good bit more. I personally created [a spreadsheet](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4mtej9pfp9ipbrk/EnergyUsageCostChart.xlsx?dl=0) and mapped out each plan with previous data, issue is you probably don't have great estimates of how much you'll use throughout the year. In my case I found I liked the straight forward pricing with no discounts to be within certain range.

The 1st one I did was just 6 months so I would not be locked in not knowing how much power I use, however 1st sign up may have had bigger discount and a year would of been better to get better picture of power used, after that went with longer plan like 3+ years. Could notice the cancelation fee.

# Anna: Get the cheapest fixed rate

Use power to choose tx website, Ethan.

I just usually go with cheapest fixed rate. No idea what kind of energy use you'll have yet? If you aren't sure do a shorter term plan (6-12 months) to start, then can lock in to 2 or 3 yr plan later when you have a better idea of what your energy usage will be.
